Edisto
Beach
is
a
town

Colleton
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
as

include
only
the
coastal
area
of

Island

majority
of
the
island
's
area
part
of
Charleston
County
,
though
the
town
itself
is
incorporated
within
Colleton
county
.

History
Edisto
Beach
was
originally
settled
by
the
Edisto
Indians
,
but
was
rediscovered
by
the
Spanish
in
the
late
00th
century
.

Thereafter
,
commerce
on
the
Island
began
to
develop
.

Rice
and
indigo
were
the
most
common
crops
during
the
early
settlement
years
.

Later
,
significant
cotton
plantations
were
built
and
flourished
.

This
industry
,
fueled
by
rich
land
owners
and
slaves
,
prospered
until
the
Civil
War
.

Although
the
Union
soldiers
thereafter
invaded
Edisto
,
and
John
's
Island
,
the
Confederate
forces
were
able
to
retain
control
of
Charleston
until
0000
,
very
late
in
the
Civil
War
.

By
the
0000s
South
Carolina
residents
began
arriving
to
Edisto
Island
,
and
Edisto
Beach
to
build
crude
retreats
.

In
those
days
,
access
to
the
island
could
be
gained
only
at
low
tide
by
driving
or
riding
across
the
marsh
on
beds
of
oyster
shells
.

Although
most
homes
on
the
island
were
destroyed
in
the
0000s
,
Hurricane
Hugo
spared
the
island
in
0000
.

It
has
since
become
a
vacation
destination
with
a
section
of
the
island
recently
purchased
by
Wyndham
Resorts
.

In
0000
,
Edisto
held
its
fist
ever
road
race
attracting
close
to
000
runners
,
including
the
mayor
.

Walterboro
is
a
city
in
Colleton
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
(
00,000
total
pop
.

of
Walterboro
Urban
Cluster
as
of
0000
)
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Colleton
County
.

History
Walterboro
(
originally
spelled
Walterborough
)
was
founded
in
0000
as
a
summer
retreat
for
local
planters
looking
to
escape
their
malaria-ridden
,
lowcountry
plantations
.

The
original
settlement
was
located
on
a
hilly
area
,
covered
with
pine
and
hickory
trees
and
named
"
Hickory
Valley
.
"

Two
of
the
earliest
settlers
were
Paul
and
Jacob
Walter
.

The
two
brothers
owned
plantations
in
nearby
Jacksonboro
,
SC
.

Paul
's
small
daughter
Mary
was
taken
ill
with
malaria
,
a
common
disease
amongst
the
families
who
built
their
plantations
in
the
marshy
areas
of
the
Lowcountry
,
suitable
to
rice
production
.

To
save
Mary
's
life
the
two
brothers
went
looking
for
a
more
healthy
location
in
which
to
live
during
the
summer
months
when
mosquitoes
abounded
and
started
the
town
that
was
later
named
for
them
.

In
0000
,
Walterboro
was
named
the
third
county
seat
of
Colleton
County
,
and
has
remained
such
until
the
present
.

This
was
followed
by
the
construction
of
a
county
courthouse
and
jail
in
0000
,
the
courthouse
being
design
by
well-known
architect
Robert
Mills
.

The
town
quickly
spread
out
from
the
original
Hickory
Valley
location
,
its
population
growth
fueled
successively
by
the
town
becoming
the
county
seat
in
0000
,
the
establishment
of
a
railroad
line
connecting
the
city
with
Columbia
and
Charleston
in
the
0000s
,
the
establishment
of
an
airfield
in
the
0000s
and
more
recently
the
establishment
of
Interstate
00
in
the
0000s
,
making
the
town
a
prime
overnight
stop
on
the
road
to
Florida
or
New
York
.

In
0000
,
Walterboro
became
home
to
the
Walterboro
Army
Air
Field
,
a
sub-base
of
Columbia
Army
Air
Base
and
part
of
the
overall
network
of
army
air
training
facilities
that
sprang
up
across
the
US
during
World
War
II
.

The
base
was
established
to
provide
advanced
air
combat
training
to
fighter
and
bomber
groups
.

It
also
hosted
the
largest
camouflage
school
in
the
United
States
,
as
well
as
a
000
person
Prisoner
of
War
Camp
.

In
0000
the
air
field
changed
commands
and
became
an
advanced
combat
training
base
for
individual
fighters
,
primarily
the
black
trainees
graduating
from
Tuskegee
Army
Air
Field
in
Tuskegee
,
Alabama
.

Over
000
of
the
famed
Tuskegee
Airmen
trained
at
Walterboro
Army
Air
Field
between
April
0000
and
October
0000
including
individuals
training
as
replacement
pilots
for
the
000nd
Fighter
Squadron
and
the
entire
000th
Bombardment
Group
.

The
base
closed
in
October
0000
and
returned
to
its
origins
as
a
local
airfield
.

Today
Walterboro
is
dotted
with
historic
homes
dating

,
theorized
to
be
named
for
the
Revolutionary
War
Colonel
Darlington
,
is
known
for
its
Darlington
Oak
and
Spanish
moss
.

Darlington
County
was
named
thus
by
an
Act
in
March
0000
.

History
Early
history
This
area
was
settled
in
the
mid-00th
century
by
Welsh
,
Scotch-Irish
,
and
English
farmers
,
who
grew
cotton
primarily
.

The
settlement
of
what
is
now
Darlington
County
began
in
earnest
after
0000
and
0000
when
the
province
of
South
Carolina
set
aside
a
vast
area
of
land
for
the
Welsh
Baptist
of
Delaware
.

This
Welsh
Track
bordered
on
both
sides
of
the
Pee
Dee
River
.

Soon
after
the
first
settlers
began
to
arrive
they
constituted
the
Welsh
Neck
Baptist
Church
.

This
church
was
first
located
on
the
north
side
of
the
Pee
Dee
River
,
opposite
present-day
Society
Hill
.

For
almost
thirty
years
settlers
concentrated
on
the
banks
and
small
tributaries
of
the
Pee
Dee
River
.

Beginning
in
the
0000s
and
continuing
into
the
0000s
other
groups
slowly
made
their
way
into
present-day
Darlington
and
were
granted
lands
on
Lynches
Creek
(
River
)
,
Jeffries
Creek
,
and
a
host
of
other
watercourses
.

These
later
settlers
included
descendants
of
French
Huguenots
,
Scots-Irish
,
and
the
English
.

For
three
decades
following
the
arrival
of
the
first
settlers
,
local
government
did
not
exist
for
the
citizens
of
the
area
.

All
deeds
,
estate
settlements
,
and
other
legal
matters
had
to
be
taken
to
Charles
Town
to
be
recorded
.

In
0000
,
by
an
Act
of
the
Assembly
,
Cheraw
District
was
established
as
a
Judicial
District
.

A
courthouse
and
gaol
(
jail
)
were
built
at
Long
Bluff
(
near
present
day
Society
Hill
)
and
were
operational
by
late
0000
.

After
the
Revolutionary
War
,
in
0000
,
Cheraw
District
was
divided
into
three
counties
,
Marlborough
,
Chesterfield
,
and
Darlington
.

Darlington
County
was
bounded
by
Cedar
Creek
,
the
Pee
Dee
River
,
and
lynches
Creek
(
River
)
.

To
this
day
there
is
uncertainty
concerning
why
the
county
was
named
Darlington
.

A
new
county
seat
was
established
near
the
center
of
the
county
,
Darlington
Court
House
.

After
0000
the
designation
"
county
"
was
changed
to
"
district
.
"

In
the
0000
South
Carolina
Constitution
,
the
designation
reverted
to
county
.

Florence
County
was
created
out
of
parts
of
Darlington
and
Marion
Counties
in
0000
.

Darlington
County
lost
additional
territory
in
0000
when
Lee
County
was
created
.

One

"
compiled
by
members
of
The
Old
Darlington
District
Chapter
of
the
South

Genealogical

.

In
more
recent
years
the
county
has
been
best
known
for
the
stock
car
races
which
take
place
at
the
Darlington
Raceway
.

Darlington
Court
House
and
Public
Square
The
public
square
and
the
Court
House
now
sit
in
their
present
location
because
of
an
argument
between
two
men
,
Colonel
Lamuel
Benton
and
Captain
Elias
Dubose
in
the
late
00th
century
.

The
tale
goes
that
the
disagreement
began
over
whether
the
courthouse
should
be
located
in
Mechanicsville
or
Cuffey
Town
South
Carolina
.

It
was
said
that
the
two
compromised
,
each
beginning
in
their
town
traveling
on
horseback
until
reaching
one
another
.

The
spot
where
they
met
is
now
the
site
of
the
Darlington
public
square
and
courthouse
.

A
fire
in
March
0000
destroyed
the
original
Court
House
.

It
was
rumored
at
the
time
that
an
old
woman
was
responsible
for
the
flames
in
an
attempt
to
burn
papers
connected
to
her
coming
court
case
.

Between
0000
and
0000
it
was
rebuilt
with
brick
due
to
a
petition
to
build
all
buildings
on
the
Public
Square
in
brick
to
prevent
the
spread
of
fire
.

Downtown
revitalization
The
city
of
Florence
has
recently
undertaken
a
massive
redevelopment
of
Downtown
Florence
.

The
city
has
completed
several
notable
projects
and
has
several
more
planned
.

The
Downtown
Redevelopment
District
was
originally
a
seventy
square
block
area
encompassing
some
in
the
heart
of
the
City
of
Florence
,
but
now
has
added
over
000
more
acres
of
the
Timrod
Park
area
with
its
historic
homes
.

The
redevelopment
of
Florence
has
even
created
a
new
branding
effort
,
to
include
new
city
department
logos
(
not
to
be
confused
with
the
city
seal
)
way
finding
signs
and
repainting
of
water
towers
.

The
historic
downtown
district
running
from
the
central
business
district
toward
the
McLeod
Medical
Center
,
features
a
number
of
historic
buildings
that
have
been
rehabilitated
.

The
redevelopment
started
with
the
$
00
million
dollar
Drs.
Bruce
and
Lee
Foundation
Library
,
and
today
now
has
the
new
Florence
Little
Theater
,
some
00
new
apartments
and
the
Francis
Marion
University
Performing
Arts
Center
which
opened
in
September
0000
,
as
well
the
new
Florence
Museum
Of
Art
,
Science
&
History
soon
to
be
under
construction
and
scheduled
for
completion
in
0000
.

New
office
space
has
emerged
from
once
abandoned
buildings
,
and
a
police
substation
was
added
on
once
crime
ridden
Dargan
Street
.

Special
efforts
are
being
aimed
at
the
downtown
area
,
which
was
once
the
center
of
the
city
's
activity
but
remains
dormant
after
retailers
and
shoppers
left
for
suburban
malls
.

The
goal
is
to
re-establish
Evans
as
a
vibrant
commercial
and
residential
corridor
,
and
five
blocks
of
Evans
Street
will
be
streetscaped

is
part
of

History
and
Witherspoon
's
Ferry
In
use
during
the
American
Revolution
,
Witherspoon
's
Ferry
was
the
site
where
Francis
Marion
accepted
command
of
the
Williamsburg
Militia
in
0000
.

Ownership
of
the
ferry
lands
passed
from
Robert
to
John
Witherspoon
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
John
bequeathed
the
land
to
Aimwell
Presbyterian
Church
.

Witherspoon
's
Ferry
was
a
strategic
ferry
in
the
northeastern
area
of
Williamsburg
County
,
vested
in
John
Witherspoon
in
0000
and
remaining
in
his
charge
until
his
death
in
0000
.

According
to
the
terms
of
John
Witherspoon
’s
will
,
the
ferry
was
then
vested
in
J.
D.
Witherspoon
,
executor
,
for
a
term
of
00
years
,
“
in
trust
for
and
having
the
sole
benefit
of
the
incorporated
Presbyterian
Church
at
Aimwell
on
the
Pee
Dee
River
.
"

In
0000
,
former
South
Carolina
Governor
David
R.
Williams
,
son-in-law
of
John
Witherspoon
,
obtained
these
ferry
lands
.

William
J.
Johnson
,
born
0000
,
succeeded
J.
D.
Witherspoon
at
the
ferry
after
purchasing
the
plantation
in
0000
from
the
Witherspoon
estate
.

The
0000
census
of
Williamsburg
County
shows
William
Johnson
,
a
man
of
considerable
wealth
for
his
time
and
place
,
living
just
below
where
the
American
Legion
stands
in
Johnsonville
today
.

Johnson
’s
Ferry
was
the
point
at
which
the
stagecoach
stopped
to
change
horses
.

As
the
stagecoach
passed
east
over
Lynches
River
on
the
ferry
,
a
Johnson
slave
in
charge
of
the
ferry
mules
announced
the
number
of
passengers
with
blast
from
a
fox
horn
:
one
blast
for
each
passenger
,
thus
informing
Mrs.
Johnson
of
the
number
of
places
that
should
be
set
for
dinner
.

The
passengers
ate
during
the
change
of
horses
,
and
then

History
Pre-Revolution
Georgetown
occupies
a
unique
place
in
American
history
.

Some
historians
claim
that
American
history
began
here
in
0000
with
the
earliest
settlement
in
North
America
by
Europeans
with
African
slaves
.

It
is
believed
that
in
that
year
the
Spanish
,
under
Lucas
Vásquez
de
Ayllón
,
founded
a
colony
on
Waccamaw
Neck
called
San
Miguel
de
Gualdape
.

The
colony
failed
for
multiple
reasons
,
including
a
fever
epidemic
and
a
revolt
of
the
African
slaves
,
who
fled
to
join
the
Cofitachiqui
Indians
in
the
area
.

Having
failed
as
farmers
,
the
surviving
Spanish
built
a
ship
from
local
cypress
and
oak
trees
and
sailed
to
the
Spice
Islands
in
Maritime
Southeast
Asia
.

After
settling
Charles
Town
in
0000
,
the
English
established
trade
with
the
Indians
.

Trading
posts
in
the
outlying
areas
quickly
became
settlements
.

By
0000
the
colonial
government
granted
the
English
residents
'
petition
to
found
a
new
parish
,
Prince
George
,
Winyah
,
on
the
Black
River
.

In
0000
,
Prince
George
,
Winyah
was
divided
;
and
the
newly
created
Prince
Frederick
Parish
congregation
occupied
the
church
at
Black
River
.

Prince
George
Parish
,
Winyah
then
encompassed
the
new
town
of
Georgetown
on
the
Sampit
River
.

In
0000
,
Elisha
Screven
laid
the
plan
for
Georgetown
and
developed
the
city
in
a
four-by-eight
block
grid
.

Referred
to
as
the
“
Historic
District
”
,
the
original
grid
city
is
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

It
bears
the
original
street
names
,
lot
numbers
,
and
many
of
the
original
homes
.

The
Indian
trade
declined
soon
after
Georgetown
was
established
;
and
planters
cultivated
indigo
as
the
cash
commodity
crop
with
rice
as
a
secondary
crop
,
both
dependent
on
slave
labor
,
primarily
imported
workers
from
Africa
.

Agricultural
profits
were
so
great
between
0000-0000
that
in
0000
the
Winyah
Indigo
Society
,
whose
members
paid
dues
in
indigo
,
opened
and
maintained
the
first
public
school
for
white
children
between
Charles
Town
and
Wilmington
.

In
the
American
Revolution
,
the
father
and
son
Georgetown
planters
,
Thomas
Lynch
,
Sr.
and
Thomas
Lynch
,
Jr.
,
signed
the
Declaration
of
Independence
.

During
the
final
years
of
the
conflict
,
Georgetown
was
the
important
port
for
supplying
General
Nathanael
Greene
's
army
.

Francis
Marion
(
the
Swamp
Fox
)
led
many
guerrilla
actions
in
this
vicinity
.

Antebellum
period
Following
the
American
Revolution
,
rice
surpassed
indigo
as
the
staple
crop
.

It
was
cultivated
on
the
swampy
lowlands
along
the
rivers
,
where
enslaved
labor
built
large
earthworks
:
the
dams
,
gates
and
canals
to
irrigate
and
drain
the
rice
fields
during
cultivation
.

Large
rice
plantations
were
established
around
Georgetown
on
its
five
rivers
.

By
0000
,
the
Georgetown
District
(
later
County
)
produced
nearly
one-half
of
the
total
rice
crop
of
the
United
States
,
and
became
the
largest
rice-exporting
port
in
the
world
.

Wealth
from
the
rice
created
an
elite
European-American
planter
class
;
they
built
stately
plantation
manor
houses
,
bought
elegant
furniture
,
and
extended
generous
hospitality
to
others
of
their
class
.

Their
relatively
leisured
lifestyle
for
a
select
few
,
built
of
the
labor
of
thousands
of
slaves
,
lasted
until
0000
.

The
profits
from
Georgetown
's
rice
trade
reached
nearby
Charleston
,
where
a
thriving
mercantile
and
factor
ing
economy
developed
.

Rice
also
supported
Charleston
artisans
:
fine
furniture
makers
,
jewelers
and
silversmiths
,
to
satisfy
the
tastes
of
the
planters
for
refined
goods
.

Joshua
John
Ward
,
who
owned
the
most
slaves
in
the
US
-
eventually
more
than
0,000
slaves
on
several
plantations
,
lived
in
Georgetown
.

Many
of
the
old
plantations
are
still
standing
today
,
including
Mansfield
Plantation
on
the
banks
of
the
Black
River
.

Joshua
Ward
's
main
Brookgreen
Plantation
is
now
the
center
and
namesake
of
the
Brookgreen
Gardens
park
.

The
town
's
thriving
economy
long
attracted
settlers
from
elsewhere
,
including
numerous
planters
and
shipowners
who
migrated
to
Georgetown
from
Virginia
.

These
included
the
Shackelford
family
,
whose
migrant
ancestor
John
Shackelford
moved
to
Georgetown
in
the
eighteenth
century
after
serving
in
the
Virginia
forces
of
the
Continental
Army
.

His
descendants
became
prominent
planters
,
lawyers
,
judges
and
Georgetown
and
Charleston
businessmen
.

Reconstruction
and
post-reconstruction
period
Georgetown
and
Georgetown
County
suffered
terribly
during
Reconstruction
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
as
agriculture
was
low
nationally
.

In
addition
,
the
rice
crops
of
0000
–
00
were
failures
due
to
lack
of
capital
preventing
adequate
preparation
for
new
crops
,
inclement
weather
,
and
the
planters
'
struggle
to
negotiate
dealing
with
free
labor
and
a
shortage
of
labor
.

Not
only
were
freedmen
traveling
to
reconstitute
families
,
but
adults
withdrew
women
and
children
as
field
laborers
.

Many
freedmen
families
wanted
to
work
for
themselves
as
subsistence
farmers
,
rather
than
labor
for
major
planters
.

Rice
continued
to
be
grown
commercially
until
about
0000
,
but
never
on
the
scale
or
with
the
profits
attained
before
0000
.

By
the
time
the
Reconstruction
era
ended
,
the
Georgetown
economy
was
shifting
to
harvesting
and
processing
wood
products
;
by
0000
there
were
several
lumber
mills
in
operation
on
the
Sampit
River
.

The
largest
was
the
Atlantic
Coast
Lumber
Company
which
provided
a
much
needed
boost
to
the
local
economy
.

00th
century
In
0000
,
historian
Mac
McAlister
said
that
around
0000
,
"
Georgetown
reached
its
peak
as
a
lumber
port
.
"

As
the
twentieth
century
dawned
,
Georgetown
under
the
leadership
of
Mayor
William
Doyle
Morgan
began
to
modernize
.

The
city
added
electricity
,
telephone
service
,
sewer
facilities
,
rail
connections
,
some
paved
streets
and
sidewalks
,
new
banks
,
a
thriving
port
,
and
a
new
public
school
.

The
US
government
built
a
handsome
combination
Post
Office
and
Customs
House
.

Like
most
cities
,
Georgetown
suffered
great
economic
deprivation
during
the
Great
Depression
.

The
Atlantic
Coast
Lumber
Company
went
bankrupt
early
in
the
depression
,
putting
almost
everyone
out
of
work
.

In
0000
help
arrived
.

In
that
year
the
Southern
Kraft
Division
of
International
Paper
opened
a
mill
;
by
0000
it
was
the
largest
in
the
world
.

A
major
disaster
struck
the
area
in
September
0000
:
Hurricane
Hugo
struck
south
of
Georgetown
,
but
with
extremely
hard
winds
and
an
intense
storm
surge
that
damaged
Georgetown
along
with
nearby
areas
.

As
Georgetown
was
under
Hugo
's
northern
eyewall
,
it
suffered
winds
more
severe
and
damaging
than
in
Charleston
,
which
was
in
the
hurricane
's
weak
corridor
.

Recent
years
In
recent
years
,
the
economy
has
become
more
diversified
.

A
steel
mill
has
located
here
.

The
steel
mill
was
financed
in
0000
by
Mitt
Romney
's
Bain
Capital
and
was
called
Georgetown
Steel
which
became
GST
Steel
Company
with
its
sister
plant
Kansas
City
Bolt
and
Nut
Company
plant
in
Kansas
City
,
Missouri
.

The
company
declared
bankruptcy
in
0000
closing
the
Kansas
City
plant
and
then
closing
the
South
Carolina
plant
in
0000
.

The
Georgetown
plant
has
subsequently
reopened
under
ownership
of
ArcelorMittal
.

Heritage
tourism
has
become
a
booming
business
.

In
addition
,
many
retirees
have
chosen
to
settle
in
this
area
of
beaches
,
plantations
redeveloped
as
residential
communities
,
and
pleasant
climate
.

Culture
Religion
Georgetown
has
number
of
historical
churches
including
Prince
George
Winyah
Episcopal
Church
,
the
oldest
religious
body
in
Georgetown
.

The
Hebrew
Cemetery
of
Georgetown
dates
to
the
0000s
.

The
first
Jewish
settlers
were
Sephardim
who
had
been
living
in
London
,
after
their
ancestors
were
expelled
from
Spain
and
Portugal
.

The
town
has
one
synagogue
,
Temple
Beth
Elohim
.

Historical
visits
Georgetown
has
been
the
destination
of
many
prominent
people
throughout
the
nearly
000
years
of
the
city
's
life
.

George
Washington
visited
Clifton
Plantation
and
addressed
the
townspeople
in
0000
.

President
James
Monroe
was
entertained
in
0000
at
Prospect
Hill
(
now
Arcadia
)
on
Waccamaw
with
a
real
red
carpet
rolled
out
to
the
river
.

Theodosia
Burr
made
her
home
at
the
Oaks
Plantation
(
now
part
of
Brookgreen
Gardens
)
after
her
marriage
to
Joseph
Alston
in
0000
;
she
departed
from
Georgetown
on
her
ill-fated
voyage
in
0000
.

Brookgreen
was
also
the
boyhood
home
of
one
of
America
's
most
famous
painters
,
Washington
Allston
.

Joel
R.
Poinsett
lived
at
White
House
Plantation
on
the
Black
River
.

After
retiring
from
government
service
,
Poinsett
entertained
President
Martin
Van
Buren
at
his
home
.

President
Grover
Cleveland
,
as
guest
of
the
Annandale
Gun
Club
,
came
for
duck
hunting
in
0000
and

.

Bernard
Baruch
,
America
's
elder
statesman
,
entertained
many
notables
at
Hobcaw
Barony
,
his
home
for
many
years
.

Among
those
were
President
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
,
Winston
Churchill
,
General
Mark
Clark
and
General
Omar
Bradley
.

Today
,
the
Historic
District

Georgetown
contains
more
than
fifty

,
public
buildings
and
sites
which
are

Murrells
Inlet
is
a
seaside
town
in
Georgetown
County
,
and
Horry
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
that
is
considered
to
be
the
"
Seafood
Capital
of
South
Carolina
"
,
but
is
also
home
to
some
of
the
nation
's
finest
golf
courses
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
town
was
once
primarily
a
fishing
village
,
but
has
grown
substantially
in
modern
time
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Grand
Strand
into
a
popular
tourist
and
retirement
location
.

It
is
most
known
for
the
Murrells
Inlet
Marshwalk
—
the
0/0

long
boardwalk
overlooking
a
pristine
saltmarsh
—
and
the
many
award-winning
seafood
and
barbecue
restaurants
along
Highway

Business
in
the

History
The
land
around
Murrells
Inlet
has
a
record
of
settlement
that
goes
back
thousands
of
years
,
before
written
history
,
but
evident
in
the
shell
mounds
and
archeological
findings
from
the
Atlantic
Ocean
to
the
Waccamaw
River
.

The
early
inhabitants
included
the
Waccamaw
Indians
who
took
advantage
of
the
natural
resources
provided
by
the
creeks
and
rivers
.

Wachesaw
is
loosely
translated
as
"
Place
of
Great
Weeping
,
"
in
reference
to
the
burial
grounds
.

Indian
burial
mounds
have
been
found
along
the
high
bluffs
at
Wachesaw
that
contained
European
beads
,
urns
and
other
artifacts
.

The
recorded
history
of
the
area
goes
back
to
the
days
of
English
settlements
and
the
land
grants
of
the
Lords
Proprietors
,
when
large
portions
of
the
Waccamaw
Neck
were
divided
into
baronies
that
stretched
from
the
Atlantic
Ocean
to
the
Waccamaw
River
.

The
baronies
were
typically
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
that
were
subdivided
into
long
narrow
plantations
that
ranged
from
000
to
0000
acres
.

The
plantations
of
Murrells
Inlet
included
The
Oaks
,
Brookgreen
,
Springfield
,
Laurel
Hill
,
Richmond
Hill
,
and
Wachesaw
(
from
south
to
north
)
.

The
first
land
grants
were
given
to
Robert
Daniell
in
0000
,
who
in
turn
sold
to
several
other
speculators
,
with
the
first
planters
arriving
in
the
0000s
to
begin
building
settlements
.

The
most
notable
(
for
historic
purposes
)
was
Captain
John
Murrell
,
who
bought
0000
acres
which
eventually
became
Wachesaw
and
Richmond
Hill
plantations
,
and
built
a
house
on
the
bluff
there
around
0000
.

He
was
a
subsistence
farmer
,
and
raised
indigo
as
the
primary
cash
crop
.

He
died
in
0000
and
left
his
land
to
his
son
Daniel
and
his
two
daughters
,
after
which
it
became
the
two
separate
plantations
.

Wachesaw
Plantation
was
eventually
purchased
by
Allard
Belin
around
0000
,
while
Richmond
Hill
passed
through
Murrell
descendants
until
it
was
sold
to
an
Allston
(
most
likely
John
Hayes
Allston
,
who
pioneered
rice
planting
techniques
with
clay
)
.

Adjacent
plantations
were
owned
by
a
host
of
famous
planters
,
including
Plowden
Weston
,
his
grandson
Plowden
C.
J.
Weston
,
William
Allston
,
Benjamin
Allston
,
Dr.
Henry
Flagg
,
Allard
Flagg
,
Joshua
Ward
,
Allard
Belin
and
their
descendants
.

These
plantations
prospered
during
the
establishment
of
the
rice
culture
of
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

These
men
were
actively
involved
with
supporting
the
American
cause
during
Revolutionary
War
,
including
William
Allston
who
was
a
captain
under
and
brother-in-law
of
Francis
Marion
(
who
had
family
ties
through
marriage
to
the
Allston
family
)
.

The
Waccamaw
Neck
planters
were
represented
in
the
state
Senate
and
House
,
as
well
as
the
Governors
and
Lieutenant
Governors
office
during
the
0000s
.

The
rice
planters
were
also
active
in
the
establishment
of
social
,
educational
,
and
religious
organizations
,
including
the
Planters
Club
,
the
Winyah
Indigo
Society
,
the
Hot
and
Hot
Fish
Club
,
the
All
Saints
Academy
,
the
Waccamaw
Methodist
Mission
,
and
All
Saints
Waccamaw
.

The
names
of
the
families
are
shown
on
the
various
historic
maps
that
date
back
as
far
as
0000
–
the
listing
of
the
Murrell
family
on
the
first
maps
is
the
most
credible
explanation
of
the
origin
of
Murrells
Inlet
.

It
has
been
alternately
shown
as
Morrall
’s
Inlet
and
Murrays
Inlet
on
later
maps
.

The
rice
plantation
era
came
to
an
end
after
the
Civil
War
with
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
(
rice
cultivation
was
labor
intensive
)
and
a
series
of
hurricanes
that
climaxed
with
the
0000
Hurricane
(
also
known
as
the
Flagg
flood
,
where
the
Atlantic
Ocean
was
reported
to
meet
the
Waccamaw
River
)
.

The
loss
of
the
slave
labor
resulted
in
the
decline
of
the
fields
,
dikes
,
and
water
control
structures
required
for
rice
cultivation
,
since
planters
had
to
rely
on
freedmen
to
work
the
fields
.

Several
powerful
hurricanes
following
the
Civil
War
and
up
to
the
0000
hurricane
resulted
in
uprooted
trees
and
flood
damaged
dikes
in
the
rice
fields
and
ultimately
ended
the
production
of
rice
on
the
Waccamaw
Neck
.

The
0000
hurricane
became
known
as
the
Flagg
Flood
because
the
Flagg
families
that
lived
in
houses
on
Magnolia
Beach
(
Dr.
Arthur
,
his
wife
Georgeanne
,
his
son
Arthur
Jr.
,
and
his
wife
and
0
children
)
were
swept
away
in
the
storm
surge
.

Dr.
Ward
Flagg
(
one
of
0
sons
)
survived
the
storm
and
retired
to
the
miller
’s
cottage
in
Brookgreen
and
reportedly
never
visited
the
ocean
again
.

After
Dr.
Allard
Flagg
's
death
in
0000
,
his
daughter
sold
Wachesaw
and
the
Hermitage
to
Samuel
Sidney
Fraser
,
a
real
estate
speculator
,
who
bought
and
sold
interests
in
several
old
plantations
after
the
Civil
War
.

Fraser
held
onto
the
plantation
briefly
before
selling
to
Robert
Ernest
Beaty
in
0000
.

Clarke
A.
Willcox
of
Marion
purchased
Wachesaw
and
the
Hermitage
in
0000
for
$
00,000
to
use
as
a
summer
retreat
.

The
Willcox
family
retained
the
Hermitage
,
but
sold
Wachesaw
in
0000
to
William
A.
Kimbel
,
who
also
bought
Richmond
Hill
with
the
purpose
of
developing
a
large
hunting
estate
.

With
his
purchase
of
both
properties
,
Kimbel
had
restored
the
boundaries
of
John
Murrell
's
original
plantation
.

In
0000
,
Dr.
Julius
A.
Mood
of
Sumter
and
a
group
of
sportsmen
bought
Brookgreen
,
Springfield
,
Laurel
Hill
,
and
The
Oaks
to
use
as
a
hunting
preserve
.

His
daughter
,
Julia
Mood
Peterkin
,
made
several
visits
to
Brookgreen
and
used
the
area
as
the
setting
for
some
of
her
novels
.

She
won
the
Pulitzer
Prize
for
Scarlet
Sister
Mary
in
0000
.

Club
members
enjoyed
their
hunting
paradise
for
ten
years
as
a
succession
of
owners
conserved
the
property
before
selling
out
to
yet
another
wealthy
outsider
seeking
a
rural
estate
in
the
south
where
land
was
cheap
.

After
numerous
owners
,
railroad
magnate
Archer
Milton
Huntington
purchased
Brookgreen
in
0000
.

At
first
,
he
and
his
wife
,
Anna
Hyatt
Huntington
,
intended
Brookgreen
as
a
winter
resort
.

Eventually
,
they
decided
to
use
the
plantation
as
an
outdoor
gallery
for
Mrs.
Huntington
's
award-winning
sculptures
.

The
Huntington
’s
constructed
Atalaya
,
a
Spanish-style
fort
,
on
the
beach
to
use
for
her
studio
and
living
quarters
at
what
is
now
Huntington
State
Park
,
abandoning
the
plantation
houses
.

Brookgreen
is
open
year
round
and
offers
tremendous
opportunities
for
investigating
the
old
rice
culture
,
modern
art
,
and
beautiful
gardens
,
for
which
Brookgreen
is
famous
today
.

The
years
during
the
Reconstruction
until
World
War
I
saw
an
increase
in
the
number
of
settlers
who
moved
to
Murrells
Inlet
to
enjoy
the
natural
resources
provided
.

The
family
names
listed
in
the
0000
–
0000
census
records
reflect
the
growth
and
are
still
found
in
Murrells
Inlet
today
.

The
families
that
moved
into
this
area
were
from
communities
like
Marion
,
Conway
,
Southport
,
and
other
nearby
counties
.

The
transportation
corridors
up
to
the
0000s
were
primarily
the
Waccamaw
River
and
the
Atlantic
Ocean
for
boats
,
and
the
Kings
Road
(
used
during
George
Washington
’s
visit
)
and
the
River
Road
(
along
the
Waccamaw
River
near
the
plantation
houses
)
for
horse
and
wagons
.

These
dirt
paths
were
crude
rough
paths
that
bore
no
resemblance
to
today
's
modern
highways
.

Highway
00
was
paved
around
0000
as
part
of
a
federal
effort
to
provide
paved
roads
across
the
United
States
.

Early
shipping
routes
relied
on
the
deepwater
access
provided
by
the
Waccamaw
River
to
move
vast
quantities
of
materials
and
goods
.

The
Comanche
was
an
early
steamship
that
called
on
Wachesaw
Landing
to
deliver
passengers
and
mail
to

Pawleys
Island
is
a
town
in
Georgetown
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
,
and
the
Atlantic
coast
barrier
island
on
which
the
town
sits
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
post
office
address
also
includes
an
unincorporated
area
on
the
mainland
adjacent
to
the
island
,
which
includes
a
commercial
district
along
the
Ocean
Highway
(
US
Route
00
)
and
a
residential
area
between
the
highway
and
the
Waccamaw
River
.

The
island
is
on
the
southern
end
of
The
Grand
Strand
and
is
one
of
the
oldest
resort
areas
of
the
US
East
Coast
.

The
town
of
Pawleys
Island
,
though
,
is
only
on
the
island
.

The
island
lies
off
the
Waccamaw
Neck
,
a
long
,
narrow
peninsula
between
the
ocean
and
the
river
.

The
island
is
connected
to
the
mainland
by
two
bridges
,
the
North
Causeway
and
the
South
Causeway
.

At
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
is
a
public
beach
access
area
.

History
The
earliest
known
inhabitants
of
the
area
were
Waccamaw
and
Winyah
Indians
.

They
called
the
area
"
Chicora
"
,
meaning
"
the
land
"
,
and
the
term
is
frequently
used
by
locals
.

The
breezy
island
quickly
became
a
refuge
from
the
mosquito
es
that
were
notable
during
the
summer
.

With
African
slave
s
that
were
brought
to
the
area
came
malaria
,
so
those
of
means
would
move
to
summer
cottages
on
the
island
to
avoid
the
mosquito-vectored
malaria
and
other
sicknesses
.
"

Why
should
we
have
to
suffer
like
the
slaves
?
"

,
said
young
Mary
Alston
.

The
town
's
namesake
George
Pawley
owned
the
island
during
the
colonial
era
,
and
sold
portions
of
it
to
other
planters
who
wanted
to
escape
malaria
.

In
0000
,
two
years
after
he
was
elected
president
,
George
Washington
toured
the
Grand
Strand
.

He
passed
right
down
The
King
's
Highway
in
the
unincorporated
portion
off
Pawleys
Island
to
visit
the
Alstons
,
wealthy
planters
who
owned
several
plantations
in
the
area
.

Rice
fields
occupied
the
Waccamaw
River
side
of
the
neck
.

The
Grand
Strand
began
to
develop
into
a
major
tourist
area
during
the
early
00th
century
,
but
Pawleys
was
among
the
last
areas
to
be
heavily
developed
.

Cypress
sided
cottages
on
the
island
gave
the
community
one
of
its
monikers
:
arrogantly
shabby
.

With
the
coming
of
Hurricane
Hugo
in
0000
,
some
of
these
cottages
were
swept
away
and
have
since
been
replaced
by
more
"
shabbier
"
homes
,
but
there
is
a
ban
on
commercial
or
industrial
buildings
on
the
island
with
the
exception
of
a
'00s
condominium
complex
and
a
few
inns
which
were
grandfathered
in
.

However
,
some
of
the
oldest
,
most
classic
homes
have
stayed
,
such
as
Beachaven
(
north
end
of
the
island
)
,
owned
by
William
Brigham
Jr.
,
and
the
PCJ
Weston
House
,
which
is
now
the
Pelican
Inn
.

The
town
government
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

Although
less
secluded
and
more
upscale
than
it
was
only
a
decade
ago
,
Pawleys
Island
still
retains
a
quaintness
and
a
relaxed
pace
which
makes
it
a
rare
island
along
the
U.S.
east
coast
.

The
water
temperature
is
comfortable
from
May
to
October
,
and
there
is
abundant
fishing
,
crabbing
,
shrimping
,
and
birdwatching
most
months
of
the
year
.

The
Gray
Man
A
local
legend
on
the
island
has
grown
about
the
Gray
Man
.

Thought
to
be
the
original
owner
of
the
Pelican
Inn
,
the
Gray
Man
[
0
]
is
a
friendly
ghost
who
warns
of
impending
hurricane
s
and
protects
the
resident
's
houses
from
the
storm
.

Serious
hurricanes
have
struck
in
0000
,
twice
in
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
and
0000
.

As
recounted
in
an
episode
of
the
TV
series
Unsolved
Mysteries
,
several
different
witnesses
reported
that
they
had
seen
the
Gray
Man
shortly
before
Hurricane
Hugo
.

Law
and
government
The
city
of
Greenville
adopted
the
Council-Manager
form
of
municipal
government
in
0000
.

History
The
colony
of
South
Carolina
was
founded
in
0000
by
King
Charles
II
,
who
split
the
land
and
gave
it
to
eight
nobles
.

The
area
now
known
as
Greenville
was
given
to
the
nobleman
King
Benjamin
Norwood
IV
.

The
era
of
King
Benjamin
's
rule
was
fraught
with
corruption
.

King
Benjamin
Norwood
was
a
notorious
opium
addict
and
even
had
several
mistresses
.

After
the
mismanagement
of
colony
,
the
area
was
reclaimed
by
the
English
Crown
.

The
area
was
part
of
the
Cherokee
Nation
's
protected
grounds
after
the
Treaty
of
0000
,
which
ended
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

No
White
man
was
allowed
to
enter
,
though
some
families
already
had
settled
just
within
the
boundary
,
and
White
traders
regularly
crossed
the
area
.

The
first
White
man
to
settle
permanently
in
the
area
was
Richard
Pearis
;
he
married
a
Cherokee
and
was
given
several
tracts
of
land
by
the
tribe
.

The
City
of
Greenville
and
Paris
Mountain
(
named
after
Pearis
)
,
are
on
part
of
that
land
.

During
the
American
Revolution
,
the
Cherokee
(
and
Pearis
)
sided
with
the
British
.

After
a
campaign
in
0000
,
the
Cherokee
agreed
to
the
Treaty
of
DeWitt
's
Corner
,
ceding
territory
that
includes
present-day
Greenville
County
to
South
Carolina
.

Greenville
was
originally
called
Pleasantburg
before
an
0000
name
change
.

Greenville
County
was
created
in
0000
from
Spartanburg
District
(
now
Spartanburg
County
)
,
but
was
called
Greenville
District
from
0000
until
0000
.

Greenville
may
have
been
named
for
American
Revolutionary
General
Nathanael
Greene
,
or
perhaps
for
an
early
resident
,
Isaac
Green
.

Greenville
is
the
mother
district
to
Pendleton
District
(
now
Anderson
County
)
,
Pickens
District
(
now
Pickens
County
)
and
Oconee
District
(
now
Oconee
County
)
.

In
February
,
0000
,
Greenville
's
Town
Charter
was
amended
by
the
S.
C.
General
Assembly
establishing
Greenville
,
the
town
,
as
a
City
.

In
0000
,
when
Greenville
was
known
as
the
"
Textile
Center
of
the
World
,
"
Old
Textile
Hall
was
designed
by
the
J.
E.
Sirrine
Company
as
the
first
exposition
facility
in
the
Southeast
for
textile
products
and
machinery
.

Textile
Hall
also
served
as
a
civic
auditorium
.

The
building
was
listed
on
National
Register
in
0000
before
being
demolished
in
0000
.

Greenville
served
as
a
training
camp
center
for
Army
recruits
during
World
War
I.
This
eventually
fostered
the
development
of
Donaldson
Air
Force
Base
,
built
during
World
War
II
,
which
was
very
important
to
the
economy
of
the
City
of
Greenville
.

Donaldson
served
as
a
military
base
until
the
early
0000s
,
when
it
was
returned
to
the
City
of
Greenville
.

The
former
air
base
has
been
developed
into
a
business
park
.

It
contains
military-style
barracks
which
are
used
now
by
businesses
.

Until
the
late
0000s
,
blacks
in
the
area
were
subject
to
segregationist
restrictions
;
for
example
,
they
were
limited
to
the
back
of
city
buses
,
were
not
permitted
to
stay
in
hotels
or
motels
for
whites
,
had
to
sit
in
the
balcony
of
movie
theaters
,
and
were
not
permitted
to
use
the
public
library
,
which
partially
motivated
the
activism
of
Jesse
Jackson
.

Jackson
,
working
through
the
NAACP
,
organized
a
sit-in
at
Greenville
's
F.W.
Woolworth
"
five
and
dime
"
store
,
and
quickly
emerged
as
a
civil
rights
leader
.

On
August
0
,
0000
,
a
sit-in
at
the
S.
H.
Kress
store
that
eventually
led
to
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
decision
Peterson
v.
Greenville
(
0000
)
,
which
ruled
that
private
citizens
must
ignore
local
segregation
ordinances
because
they
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
Fourteenth
Amendment
.

Attractions
As
the
largest
city
in
the
Upstate
,
Greenville
offers
many
activities
and
attractions
.

Greenville
's
theatres
and
event
venues
regularly
host
major
concerts
and
touring
theater
companies
.

Four
independent
theaters
present
several

Downtown
renewal
Greenville
has
one
of
the
last
Frank
Lloyd
Wright
homes
ever
built
,
constructed
in
0000
.

At
one
time
the
retail
center
of
the
region
,
Greenville
's
downtown
district
began
to
languish
in
the
0000s
as
shopping
centers
lured
the
retailers
and
customers
to
the
suburbs
.

In
response
,
the
City
started
a
downtown
renewal
project
.

City
leaders
initially
focused
on
improving
the
streetscape
along
a
portion
of
Main
Street
in
the
Central
Business
District
.

This
included
narrowing
the
street
from
four
lanes
to
two
lanes
;
installing
angled
parking
spaces
,
trees
,
flowers
and
light
fixtures
;
and
creating
parks
and
plazas
throughout
the
central
core
of
downtown
.

Initial
planning
began
in
the
0000s
and
under
Mayor
Max
Heller
,
an
Austrian
immigrant
who
wanted
to
implement
some
of
the
urban
features
he
had
seen
in
Europe
.

The
downtown
streetscape
renovation
was
designed
by
Landscape
Architect
Lawrence
Halprin
.

In
the
0000s
,
Greenville
turned
to
laying
the
foundation
for
their
downtown
vision
and
providing
an
example
of
business
potential
to
encourage
business
relocation
to
downtown
(
examples
include
the
Greenville
Commons/Hyatt
Regency
hotel
)
.

The
city
worked
with
consultants
to
develop
and
implement
a
downtown
master
plan
and
facilitated
public-private
investment
partnerships
which
resulted
in
the
city
's
first
luxury
convention
hotel
on
Main
Street
.

Through
the
0000s
Greenville
continued
to
strengthen
its
public/private
partnerships
to
create
strong
anchors
throughout
downtown
.

The
city
redeveloped
a
languishing
industrial
area
adjacent
to
the
West
End
Historic
District
into
a
thriving
performing
arts
complex
that
incorporated
historically
significant
buildings
.

It
then
stabilized
the
stagnant
historic
district
with
the
transformation
of
an
abandoned
cotton
warehouse
into
the
West
End
Market
,
a
mixed-use
project
of
shops
,
restaurants
,
and
offices
,
which
in
turn
encouraged
adaptive
reuse
of
several
other
historic
buildings
throughout
downtown
.

The
city
's
initiative
to
invest
in
its
blighted
urban
center
at
a
time
when
such
revitalization
was
unpopular
,
not
only
successfully
encouraged
private
investment
,
but
also
eventually
garnered
recognition
from
municipalities
across
the
United
States
.

Although
the
majority
of
Greenville-area
residents
live
outside
of
the
central
urban
core
,
the
last
decade
has
brought
a
significant
increase
in
downtown
living
and
working
as
new
luxury
condos
,
apartments
and
lofts
go
up
and
more
businesses
are
moving
their
offices
to
the
now
thriving
downtown
.

The
National
Trust
for
Historic
Preservation
awarded
Greenville
with
the
Great
American
Main
Street
Award
in
0000
and
0000
.

Since
then
it
has
been
featured
in
numerous
publications
,
including
Southern
Living
Magazine
and
the
U.S.
Airways
Magazine
(
March
0000
)
.

efforts

opening

.

Existing

Economy
According
to
an
article
published
by
The
New
York
Times
in
0000
,
Greenwood
county
experienced
the
sharpest
economic
decline
,
according
to
poverty
rates
,
of
any
county
in
the
United
States
.

One
of
the
contributing
factors
to
this
decline
was
the
deindustrialization
of
the
textile
mills
that
at
one
time
supported
the
economy
of
Greenwood
.

Over
time
a
large
majority
of
the
textile
mills
were
shut
down
which
elminated
numerous
jobs
from
the
Greenwood
community
.

Many
of
the
middle-income
citizens
in
Greenwood
also
experienced
lay
offs
and
cutbacks
due
to
the
recession
.

Because
of
this
,
many
of
these
middle-class
individuals
were
forced
to
settle
for
jobs
that
they
would
not
ordinarily
take
.

This
took
jobs
that
would
have
been
available
the
poor
,
uneducated
citizens
.

This
is
looked
at
to
be
a
kind
of
domino
effect
to
the
working
poor
and
unemployed
.

Origin
of
Name
There
is
much
confusion
about
the
mysterious
name
,
"
Ninety-Six
,
"
and
the
true
origin
may
never
be
known
.

Speculation
has
led
to
a
romantic
Indian
myth
;
to
the
mistaken
belief
that
it
was
00
miles
to
the
nearest
Cherokee
settlement
of
Keowee
;
to
a
counting
of
creeks
crossing
the
main
road
leading
from
Lexington
,
S.
C
,
to
Ninety-Six
,
S.C.
;
to
an
interpretation
of
a
Welsh
expression
,
"
nanty
-
sechs
,
"
meaning
"
dry
gulch
.
"

However
,
no
one
is
able
to
confirm
that
Robert
Goudey
was
Welsh
,
English
,
Scottish
,
or
German
.

An
examination
of
early
maps
indicates
markings
such
as
"
00
"
and
"
00
"
and
"
00
"
at
different
points
,
possibly
indicating
"
chains
.
"

Since
Ninety-Six
was
located
in
Clarendon
Parish
,
could
it
be
possible
that
Parish
linear
measurements
used
in
England
were
used
on
colonial
maps
to
measure
distances
in
"
chains
?
"

In
England
,
according
to
a
British
and
Welsh
booklet
designating
linear
measurements
,
Parish
maps
used
a
rule
of
"
0
chains
to
the
inch
.
"

In
using
that
parish
rule
on
an
early
map
of
colonial
South
Carolina
,
00
"
chains
"
on
a
map
would
probably
cover
approximately
00
inches
,
the
map
distance
from
"
Saxe
Gotha
"
(
modern
Lexington
,
S.C.
)
to
Ninety-Six
.

Using
the
same
measurements
for
the
distance
from
Ninety-Six
to
the
Savannah
River
,
the
measurement
would
be
approximately
0.0
inches
or
0
"
chains
,
"
hence
00
.

Even
so
,
the
origin
of
the
name
,
"
Ninety-Six
,
"
likely
remains
a
mystery
.

History
Ninety
Six
was
established
in
the
early
00th
century
.

The
National
Park
Service
operates
the
Ninety
Six
National

the
world
renowned
Polish
hero
Colonel
Tadeusz
Kościuszko
,
who
was
also
wounded
at
the
siege
.

This
siege
is
described
in
the
chapter
Ninety-Six
of
the
historic
novel
of
Kenneth
Roberts
:
Oliver
Wiswell
,
0000
,
as
well
as
the
0000
novel
The
Forayers
,
by
William
Gilmore
Simms
.

The
American
Loyalists
survived
the
siege
and
moved
to
Rawdon
,
Nova
Scotia
,
Canada
.

Notable
people
Preston
Brooks
achieved
notoriety
for
his
brutal
attack
on
the
Massachusetts
abolitionist
senator
,
Charles
Sumner
,
in
the
Senate
Chamber
in
0000
after
Sumner
had
delivered
a
speech
comparing
slavery
to
a
harlot
and
slaveholders
to
those
who
embraced
her
,
to
which
Brooks
objected
violently
.

Ninety
Six
honored
Brooks
with
the
largest
gathering
ever
in
that
region
.

Thousands
of
canes
were
presented
to
Brooks
to
replace
the
one
he
had
broken
while
beating
Sumner
(
who
remained
incapacitated
for
years
as
a
result
)

Southern
Railway
in
Furman
From
0000
until
the
0000s
,
the
Southern
Railway
operated
a
line
through
Furman
and
nearby
Allendale
,
Tarboro
(
Jasper
County
)
,
and
Lena
,
SC
.

Called
the
"
Southern
Columbia
to
Savannah
Route
"
,
the
rail
also
ran
through
Barnwell
and
Blackville
to
the
North
.

Its
primary
purpose
for
Southern
RR
was
to
increase
North/South
passenger/freight
traffic
by
feeding
into
ACL
(
Atlantic
Coast
Line
)
at
Hardeeville
for
passage
South
to
Florida
or
North
to
Charleston
and
other
points
.

The
rail
line
was
built
to
compete
with
another
North/South
rail
line
operated
nearby
by
Seaboard
Air
Line
(
also
called
the
Florida
Central
&
Peninsular
,
Seaboard
Coast
Line
,
and
presently
CSX
)
which
ran
a
different
course
through
Denmark
,
Fairfax
,
Estill
,
Garnett
(
parallel
to
US000
)
and
then
into
Georgia
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
Southern
abandoned
its
tracks
between
Furman
and
Hardeeville
leaving
Furman
as
the
ending
station
from
Columbia
.

Finally
,
in
the
early
0000s
,
Southern
abandoned
its
tracks
south
of
Blackville
ending
its
rail
service
to
Barnwell
,
Allendale
,
and
Furman
.

[

However
,
by
the
0000s
,
any
rail
service
to
Furman
would
have
been
a
rare
event
.

,
the
coastal
areas
of
northernmost
South
Carolina
were
used
mostly
as
farming
sites
(
the
real
estate
monolith
now
known
as
Burroughs
and
Chapin
for
decades
was
named
“
Myrtle
Beach
Farms
”
)
.

Sea
breezes
washed
nutrients
on
crops
planted
on
sand
dunes
,
much
as
now
is
done
through
roots
in
hydroponic
gardens
,
and
cotton
and
tobacco
thrived
;
farmers
from
Loris
,
Gallivant
’s
Ferry
,
Florence
and
other
low-country
towns
bought
land
on
the
coast
for
practical
reasons
and
then
spent
summers
with
their
families
there
,
rather
than
stay
in
the
hellish
heat
and
sand
fleas
of
their
main
farms
.

As
a
result
,
a
few
people
subsequently
built
vacation
homes
in
the
first
resort
area
,
Murrell
’s
Inlet
,
and
,
later
,
erected
rooming
houses
north
in
what
would
become
Myrtle
Beach
.

One
influential
example
was
the
Patricia
Court
(
later
Patricia
Inn
and
now
Patricia
Grand
Resort
)
started
in
the
0000s
but
reaching
importance
in
the
late
0000s
,
built
by
Patricia
Rousseau
of
North
Wilkesboro
,
NC
.

Further
north
still
,
Ken
and
Ginny
Ellsworth
recognized
that
the
idea
of
living
at
the
beach
for
its
own
sake
could
be
expanded
into
a
community
.

They
found
a
large
tract
of
land
owned
by
Elizabeth
Patterson
,
a
daughter
of
the
Chapin
family
.

As
soon
as
it
was
possible
after
acquiring
the
property
the
Ellsworths
dug
a
yacht
basin
on
the
adjacent
Intracoastal
Waterway
,
on
the
land
side
of
US
Highway
00
.

They
built
a
small
cottage
between
the
highway
and
yacht
basin
so
they
could
be
close
both
to
the
wealthy
people
on
the
waterway
and
the
potentially
larger
numbers
of
people
driving
down
the
main
road
from
New
York
to
Miami
.

(
The
idea
of
capitalizing
on
the
highway
also
motivated
Jack
Nelson
who
built
the
El
Rancho
Motel
,
once
featured
in
Life
Magazine
,
about
ten
miles
(
00
km
)
south
.
)

Ken
and
Ginny
cut
roads
,
layered
them
with
coquina
(
a
local
mix
of
sand
and
fossilized
shells
)
,
and
looked
for
residents
.

Among
the
first
people
to
move
in
were
Ginny
’s
parents
who
built
a
home
on
what
is
now
North
Gate
Road
,
just
on
the
edge
of
the
brow
above
the
drop-down
to
the
beach
,
backing
up
to
the
huge
lot
owned
by
the
Lewis
family
(
who
owned
the
northernmost
fishing
pier
in
the
area
)
.

The
location
on
the
brow
—
like
that
of
Patterson
’s
home
,
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
property
—
was
intended
to
provide
both
easy
access
to
the
shore
and
protection
from
storms
(
a
plan
that
has
worked
until
the
present
day
)
.

Next
came
the
Sorry
(
pronounced
"
Sow-ree
"
;
rhymes
with
"
Horry
,
"
as
in
the
county
)
family
,
who
built
next
to
the
Gasques
.

They
were
followed
by
the
Dutch
van
Buren
family
(
distant
descendants
of
the
American
President
)
,
who
discovered
the
place
by
anchoring
one
night
in
the
yacht
basin
on
a
trip
south
and
then
visiting
the
land
,
deciding
to
build
a
home
and
retire
,
which
proved
the
wisdom
of
Ken
Ellsworth
’s
original
scheme
.

The
van
Burens
told
another
Dutch
family
—
Anton
Frederik
and
Casperina
Hermina
Groeneveld
Baarslag
,
friends
of
theirs
from
New
York
and
Vermont
—
about
the
place
who
visited
and
then
moved
down
in
0000
.

In
0000
Alfred
Colby
Hockings
and
his
wife
—
he
was
a
well-known
illustrator
for
Field
and
Stream
magazine
,
originally
from
Wisconsin
but
most
recently
living
in
the
artists
'
community
of
Tryon
,
North
Carolina
—
-
built
a
home
up
the
street
from
the
Gasques
and
Sorrys
and
across
from
the
Baarslags
;
at
almost
the
same
time
another
Dutch
family
—
Gerbrand
and
Nellie
Poster
,
the
son-in-law
and
daughter
of
the
Baarslags
,
came
down
from
New
York
City
to
visit
her
parents
for
Christmas
,
decided
to
stay
,
and
built
a
home
next
door
to
her
parents
.

(
Poster
was
later
to
found
Coastal
Federal
Savings
and
Loan
Association
and
use
connections
developed
during
his
military
service
as
a
Dutch
national
in
the
US
Army
during
World
War
II
to
help
convince
the
US
Government
to
declare
that
the
damage
done
by
Hurricane
Hazel
in
0000
should
be
covered
by
insurance
.

This
made
possible
the
second
renaissance
of
the
community
,
the
first
having
been
its
emergence
from
the
Great
Depression
.
)

At
this
time
,
all
the
homes
in
Briarcliffe
—
except
for
the
van
Burens
,
who
lived
across
the
road
from
the
central
lake
,
and
Elizabeth
Patterson
,
whose
home
was
on
what
is
now
South
Gate
Road
—
were
clustered
along
what
is
now
North
Gate
Road
.

And
two
developments
,
one
small
and
one
huge
,
changed
Briarcliffe
in
ways
that
remain
to
this
day
.

The
first
was
the
Poster
family
itself
,
which
when
moving
in
included
a
0
year
old
and
a
0
year
old
and
who
were
soon
joined
by
a
newborn
.

This
changed
the
tenor
of
Briarcliffe
by
moving
it
from
a
retirement
community
to
a
third
(
less-expensive
)
alternative
to
the
Pine
Lakes
and
Dunes
sections
,
all
of
which
offered
a
place
to
rear
a
family
close
to
,
but
not
in
,
the
increasing
tawdriness
of
Myrtle
Beach
itself
.

The
second
was
the
financial
impact
of
the
government
’s
intervention
with
the
insurance
companies
after
Hurricane
Hazel
.

The
companies
had
wanted
to
declare
the
damage
“
high
water
,
”
which
was
not
covered
;
Poster
convinced
the
authorities
that
the
damage
had
been
caused
by
“
wind-driven
water
,
”
which
was
covered
.

This
changed
the
whole
of
Myrtle
Beach
,
as
payment
of
claims
allowed
small
rooming
houses
to
be
replaced
by
motels
.

This
impacted
the
whole
of
coastal
South
Carolina
,
including
Briarcliffe
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
United
States
Air
Force
had
decided
to
deal
with
the
Myrtle
Beach
Air
Force
Base
by
treating
it
as
a
sort
of
reward
to
which
people
could
be
assigned
if
they
deserved
a
vacation
or
a
punishment
for
those
whose
careers
were
at
an
end
.

Many
people
in
both
groups
chose
Briarcliffe
as
a
place
in
which
to
build
or
buy
,
ranging
from
important
Air
Force
heroes
(
such
as
Col.
Francis
[
"
Gabby
"
]
Gabreski
,
the
first
pilot
to
be
an
"
ace
"
in
two
wars
)
to
investors
,
artists
and
simple
families
.

The
boom
in
Myrtle
Beach
led
to
a
boom
in
Briarcliffe
,
and
soon
a
community
once
associated
with
raccoons
and
deer
became
a
residential
destination
.

Among
the
significant
people
in
this
new
wave
must
be
remembered
Rolf
Bierens
,
another
Dutchman
who
—
having
retired
from
General
Motors
thanks
to
his
involvement
in
the
design
of
their
automatic
transmission
—
first
built
his
home
with
his
own
hands
and
then
the
first
cabana
.

Increasingly
,
other
residents
brought
histories
,
such
as
the
then-industrialist
Krampf
,
button-manufacturer
Schwanda
and
developer
Passow
.

Briarcliffe
was
once
a
place
of
lakes
,
pine
and
scrub-oak
forests
and
wild
animals
.

Many
early
residents
—
largely
Netherlanders
who
had
sought
liberation
—
had
settled
there
seeking
freedom
.

When
people
started
naming
streets
(
in
the
0000s
someone
put
up
a
sign
declaring
that
what
is
now
“
Hickory
Lane
”
or
“
Holly
Lane
”
was
“
Phalarope
Path
”
)
it
caused
weeks
of
muttering
.

So
when
other
newcomers
began
demanding
structured
government
--
“
You
know
,
like
we
had
it
back
home
”
—
the
few
remaining
originals
,
such
as
Nellie
Poster
,
moved
,
resigned
themselves
to
their
fates
or
obligingly
died
.

Transportation
Airports
History
Henry
Buck
of
Bucksport
,
Maine
moved
to
South
Carolina
in
the
0000s
to
start
lumber
mills
;
Horry
County
had
a
significant
timber
industry
with
its
cypress
,
pine
and
hardwood
forests
.

One
of
Buck
's
mills
was
in
what
became
Bucksport
.

Sawmills
in
Bucksport
and
Bucksville
produced
0
million
board
feet
of
lumber
annually
by
0000
.

Buck
used
his
ships
to
transport
lumber
to
Georgetown
and
Charleston
in
South
Carolina
and
as
far
away
as
New
York
City
and
Boston
,
and
even
to
other
countries
.

Lumber
from
Buck
's
operation
even
went
into
the
construction
of
the
Brooklyn
Bridge
.

The
Independent
Republic
Quarterly
said
,
"
By
0000
,
due
largely
to
Bucksville
and
Bucksport
,
Horry
District
had
become
one
of
the
five
greatest
timber-producing
districts
in
the
state
.

Conway
is
a
city
in
Horry
County
,
South
Carolina
.

The
population
was

census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Horry
County
and
is
part

metropolitan
area
.

It
is
the

.

Numerous
buildings
and

Conway
are
on

building
,
reputedly
designed
by

.

Since
the
completion
of
the
Main
Street
USA
project
in
the
0000s
,
Conway
's
downtown
has
been
revitalized
with
shops
and
bistros
.

Highlighting
the
renovation
of
the
downtown
area
is
the
Riverwalk
,
an

History
Conway
is
one
of
the
oldest
towns
in

.

Originally
named
Kingston
,
the
town
was
created
in

as
part
of
Royal
Governor
Robert
Johnson
's
Township

,
but
before
,
that
Mckevlin

Myrtle
Beach
(
)
is
a
coastal
city
on
the
east
coast
of
the
United
States
in
Horry
County
,
South
Carolina
.

It
is
situated
on
the
center
of
a
large
and
continuous
stretch
of
beach
known
as
the
Grand
Strand
in
northeastern
South
Carolina
.

Myrtle
Beach
is
one
of
the
major
centres
of
tourism
in
the
United
States
because
of
the
city
's
warm
subtropical
climate
and
extensive
beaches
,
attracting
an
estimated
00
million
visitors
each
spring/summer/fall
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
population
of
the
city
was
00,000
,
with
the
Myrtle
Beach-North
Myrtle
Beach-Conway
combined
statistical
area
population
of
000,000
.

Geography
Technically
a
man-made
island
,
Myrtle
Beach
has
been
separated
from
the
continental
United
States
since
0000
by
the
Intracoastal
Waterway
,
forcing
the
city
and
area
in
general
to
develop
within
a
small
distance
from
the
coast
.

In
part
due
to
this
separation
,
the
area
directly
west
of
Myrtle
Beach
across
the
waterway
remained
primarily
rural
,
whereas
its
northern
and
southern
ends
were
bordered
by
other
developed
tourist
towns
,
North
Myrtle
Beach
and
Surfside
Beach
.

Since
then
,
the
inland
portion
of
the
Myrtle
Beach
area
has
developed
dramatically
and
the
beach
itself
is
developing
westward
.

Due
to
strong
erosion
and
tropical
cyclone
s
along
the
Atlantic
Ocean
,
the
city
is
separated
from
its
beach
by
large
dunes
populated
with
sea
grasses
,
which
stabilize
the
sandy
soil
underneath
and
act
as
a
natural
seawall
against
storm
surge
.

In
conjunction
,
the
city
has
also
renourished
the
beach
's
sands
several
times
,
with
one
instance
almost
immediately
followed
by
the
landfalls
of
hurricanes
Hugo
and
Hazel
,
necessitating
a
second
replenishment
to
fill
in
the
quick
loss
of
the
first
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
.

Climate
According
to
Köppen
climate
classification
,
Myrtle
Beach
has
a
humid
subtropical
climate
or
Cfa
–
typical
of
the
Gulf
and
South
Atlantic
states
.

The
city
enjoys
abundant
sunshine
year-round
with
more
than
0000
hours
annually
.

The
summer
season
is
long
,
hot
,
and
humid
in
Myrtle
Beach
.

Average
daytime

)
and
average
night-time
lows
are
near
00
°
F
(

)
.

The
coastal
location
of
Myrtle
Beach
mitigates
summer
heat
somewhat
compared
to
inland
areas
of
South
Carolina
:
Thus
,
while
nearby
Florence
,
SC
averages
00
days
annually
with
high
temperatures
of
00
°
F
or
higher
-
Myrtle
Beach
averages
only

.

The
Bermuda
High
pumps
in
humidity
from
the
tropical
Atlantic
toward
Myrtle
Beach
,
giving
summers
a
near
tropical
feel
in
the
city
.

The
warm
Atlantic
Ocean
reaches
00
°
F
or
higher
in
the
summer
months
off
Myrtle
Beach
,
making
for
warm
and
sultry
summer
nights
.

Summer
thunderstorms
are
common
in
the
hot
season
in
Myrtle
Beach
,
and
the
summer

the
most
precipitation
.

In

,
thunderstorms
normally
build
during
the

followed
by
brief
and
intense
downpours
.

Summer
thunderstorms
can
be
severe
,
but
tornadoes
are
rare
in
Myrtle
Beach
.

Tropical
cyclones
occasionally
impact
Myrtle
Beach
,
through
weaker
tropical
storms
and
weak
tropical
lows
are
more
common
.

Like
most
areas
prone
to
tropical
cyclones
,
a
direct
hit
by
a
major
hurricane
is
infrequent
in
Myrtle
Beach
.

The
last
hurricane
to
cause
significant
damage
in
Myrtle
Beach
was
Hurricane
Hugo
in
0000
.

The
worst
hurricane
in
the
history
of
Myrtle
Beach
was
Hurricane
Hazel
in
0000
.

History
Prior
to
the
arrival
of
Europeans
,
the
Long
Bay
area
was
inhabited
by
the
native
Waccamaw
Tribe
.

The
Waccamaw
used
the
river
for
travel
and
fished
along
the
shore
around
Little
River
.

Waties
Island
,
the
primary
barrier
island
along
Long
Bay
,
has
evidence
of
burial
and
shell
mounds
,
remains
of
the
visiting
Waccamaw
.

The
first
European
settler
along
Long
Bay
arrived
in
the
late
00th
Century
,
attempting
to
extend
the
plantation
system
outward
towards
the
ocean
.

Records
are
sparse
from
this
period
,
with
most
of
the
recorded
history
pieced
together
from
old
land
grants
documents
.

These
settlers
were
met
with
mixed
results
,
producing
unremarkable
quantities
of
indigo
and
tobacco
as
the
coast
's
soil
was
sandy
and
most
of
the
crop
yields
were
of
an
inferior
quality
.

Prior
to
the
American
Revolution
,
the
area
along
the
future
Grand
Strand
was
essentially
uninhabited
.

Several
families
received
land
grants
along
the
coast
,
including
the
Witherses
:
John
,
Richard
,
William
,
and
Mary
.

This
family
received
an
area
around
present-day
Wither
's
Swash
,
also
known
as
Myrtle
Swash
or
the
eight-Mile
Swash
.

A
separate
grant
was
granted
to
James
Minor
,
including
a
barrier
island
named
Minor
Island
,
now
Waties
Island
,
off
of
the
coast
near
Little
River
.

Mary
Wither
's
gravestone
at
Prince
George
Winyah
Episcopal
Church
speaks
to
the
remoteness
of
the
former
Strand
:
"
She
gave
up
the
pleasures
of
Society
and
retired
to
Long
Bay
,
where
she
resided
a
great
part
of
her
life
devoted
to
the
welfare
of
her
children
.
"

As
the
American
colonies
gained
independence
,
the
area
remained
essentially
unchanged
,
and
the
coast
remained
barren
.

George
Washington
scouted
out
the
Southern
states
during
his
term
,
traveling
down
the
King
's
Highway
.

He
stayed
a
night
at
Windy
Hill
(
part
of
present
day
North
Myrtle
Beach
)
and
was
led
across
Wither
's
Swash
to
Georgetown
by
Jeremiah
Vereen
.

The
Withers
family
remained
one
of
the
few
settlers
around
Myrtle
Beach
for
the
next
half-century
.

In
0000
,
a
strong
hurricane
swept
the
house
of
R.
F.
Withers
into
the
ocean
,
drowning
00
people
inside
.

The
tragedy
made
the
Withers
family
decide
to
abandon
their
plots
along
the
coast
.

Left
unattended
,
the
area
began
to
return
to
forest
.

The
Burroughs
and
Collins
Company
of
Conway
purchased
much
of
the
Withers
’
family
land
in
0000
,
and
the
growing
community
was
called
New
Town
around
the
start
of
the
00th
century
.

A
community
named
"
Withers
"
post
office
was
established
at
the
site
of
the
old
Swash
in
0000
.

On
February
00
,
0000
Burroughs
and
Collins
,
predecessor
of
modern
day
Burroughs
and
Chapin
,
received
their
charter
to
build
the
Conway
&
Seashore
Railroad
to
transport
timber
from
the
coast
to
inland
customers
.

The
Withers
post
office
then
was
replaced
by
the
first
Myrtle
Beach
post
office
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
railroad
began
daily
service
on
May
0
,
0000
with
two
wood-burning
locomotives
.

One
of
the
engines
was
dubbed
The
Black
Maria
and
came
second-hand
from
a
North
Carolina
logging
operation
.

After
the
railroad
was
finished
,
employees
of
the
lumber
and
railroad
company
would
take
train
flatcar
s
down
to
beach
area
on
their
free
weekends
,
becoming
the
first
Grand
Strand
tourists
.

The
railroad
terminus
was
nicknamed
"
New
Town
"
,
contrasting
it
with
the
"
Old
Town
"
,
or
Conway
.

Around
the
start
of
the
00th
century
,
Franklin
Burroughs
envisioned
turning
New
Town
into
a
tourist
destination
rivaling
the
Florida
and
northeastern
beaches
.

Burroughs
died
in
0000
,
but
his
sons
completed
the
railroad
's
expansion
to
the
beach
and
opened
the
Seaside
Inn
in
0000
.

Around
0000
,
a
contest
was
held
to
name
the
area
and
Burroughs
'
wife
suggested
honoring
the
locally
abundant
shrub
,
the
Southern
Wax
Myrtle
(
Myrica
cerifera
)
.

A
Myrtle
Beach
post
office
was
subsequently
built
,
followed
by
the
area
incorporating
as
a
town
in
0000
and
as
a
city
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Myrtle
Beach
Municipal
Airport
was
built
,
however
it
was
promptly
taken
over
by
the
United
States
Army
Air
Corps
in
0000
and
converted
into
a
military
base
.

Commercial
flights
began
in
0000
and
shared
the
runway
for
over
00
years
until
the
air
base
closed
in
0000
.

Since
then
the
airport
has
been
named
Myrtle
Beach
International
Airport
.

In
0000
plans
to
build
a
new
terminal
were
approved
.

In
0000
,
Kings
Highway
was
finally
paved
,
giving
Myrtle
Beach
its
first
primary
highway
.

Infrastructure
Air
Rail
The

Coast
Line
Railroad
is
currently
a
short-line
railroad
division
of
the
Baltimore

Annapolis
Railroad
,
extending
from
a
connection
with
the
Carolina
Southern
Railroad
,
another
division
of
that
company
,
at
Conway
to
Myrtle
Beach
.

The
line
was
opened
in
0000
by
the
Conway
Coast
and
Western
Railroad
,
a
predecessor
of
the
Atlantic
Coast
Line
Railroad
.

The
Seaboard
System
Railroad
sold
the
line
to
Horry
County
in
November
0000
,
and
it
was
operated
by
the
Horry
County
Railway
until
October
0000
,
when
the
WCLR
took
over
.

The
Carolina
Southern
Railroad
acquired
the
WCLR
in
September
0000
,
and
since
then
it
has
been
a
division
of
the
Baltimore
and
Annapolis
Railroad
.

The
line
is
owned
by
Horry
County
,
but
was
leased

Southern
Railroad
has
become
one
of
the
frequent
destinations
for
freight
services
as
well
as
passenger
cars
and
observational
locomotives
.

The
railroad
was
originally
erected
in

and
the
first
train
steamed
into
the
Conway
Depot
in
December
0000
.

The
Carolina
Southern
Railroad
stands
as
a
permanent
landmark
in

.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
Carolina
Southern
Railroad
voluntary
shut
down
because
several
bridges
along
the
rail
were
overdue
for
maintenance
.

The
shutdown
caused
Carolina
Southern
Railroad
to
lay
off
nearly
all
of
its
employees
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
Federal
Railroad
Administration
(
FRA
)
commenced
a
bridge
inspection
on
the
CSR
and
the
Waccamaw
Coastline
Railroad
(
the
Horry
County
portion
of
rail
)
.

Fifty-two
of
000
bridges
were
inspected
and
seven
had
critical
defects
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
CSR
voluntarily
ceased
operation
,
so
that
they
could
bring
in
a
certified
bridge
engineer
to
inspect
the
seven
critical
bridges
and
prepare
a
plan
for
their
repairs
.

Based
on
the
engineer
’s
recommendations
,
CSR
made
the
necessary
repairs
on
the
bridges
and
CSR
resumed
operations
August
0
,
0000
.

The
FRA
returned
to
inspect
the
bridges
and
made
a
recommendation
that
CSR
cease
operations
until
all
bridge
repairs
were
completed
.

There
are
currently
efforts
to
bring
the
railroad
back
online
.

Bike
Week
,
also
called
"
Harley
Bike
Week
"
is
a
week-long
motorcycle
rally
that
started
in
0000
and
attracted
as
many
as
000,000
visitors
to
the
city
every
May
.

Black

,
founded

,
takes
place

around

Weekend
and
is
the
largest
African
American
motorcycle
rally
in
the
US
and
attracts
as
many
as
000,000
visitors
.

The
event
was
created
in
response
to
a
history
of
discrimination
against
African-American
visitors
and
riders
to
Myrtle
Beach
and
the
Grand
Strand
Area
.

The
Myrtle
Beach
government
created
00
new
laws
aimed
at
preventing
all
sanctioned
motorcycle
events
within
the
city
in
response
to
controversy
including
accusations
of
racism
by
African-American
riders
during
their
event
and
complaints
of
lawlessness
and
poor
behavior
during
all
highly
attended
events
.

Several
lawsuits
by
the
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
(
NAACP
)
against
Myrtle
Beach
businesses
were
settled
with
agreements
that
discrimination
cease
,
compensation
be
given
to
some
plaintiffs
,
and
employees
be
given
diversity
training
.

The
NAACP
suit
against
the
City
of
Myrtle
Beach
was
settled
in
0000
without
the
city
paying
damages
,
but
with
the
agreement
police
would
use
the
same
traffic
control
rules
during
both
the
black
and
the
white
motorcycle
rallies
.

The
South
Carolina
Supreme
Court
in
June
0000
unanimously
overturned
one
of
the
00
ordinances
,
which
had
required
all
motorcyclists
to
wear
helmets
,
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
law
,
requiring
helmets
only
for
riders
under
age
00
,
can
not
be
preempted
by
a
city
ordinance
.

In
addition
,
the
Court
ruled
,
the
ordinance
created
undue
confusion
,
and
that
the
city
itself
had
invalidated
their
own
helmet
law
and
some
other
ordinances
in
a
subsequent
amendment
.

The
law
had
been
challenged
by
a
group
of
motorcyclists
and
a
group
of
Myrtle
Beach
businesses
called
BOOST
,
Business
Owners
Organized
to
Support
Tourism
,
who
opposed
the

anti-motorcycle

policy

and
0.00

(

History
Surfside
Beach
was
first
incorporated
in
0000
with
000
residents
.

It
was
previously
known
as
Roach
's
Beach
and
had
only
a
few
buildings
surviving
the
hurricane
of
0000
.

Principal
industries
were
lumber
and
feed
farming
for
the
00
or
so
horses
and
mules
in
the
area
.

The
new
owner
,
Mr.
George
J.
Holiday
,
renamed
the
area
Floral
Beach
for
his
wife
,
Flora
,
and
daughter
,
Floramay
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
a
group
from
Columbia
purchased
and
partially
developed
the
land
.

In
0000
,
most
of
the
land
changed
hands
again
and
became
known
as
Surfside
Beach
.

The
undeveloped
beach
area
was
covered
with
sand
dunes
;
a
one-lane
sandy
road
led
from
the
highway
to
a
quiet
,
family
beach
.

Hurricane
Hazel
in
0000
destroyed
00
of
the
beach
's
00
houses
,
but
did
not
dampen
the
spirit
of
the
developers
.

Lots
were
cleared
,
the
sand
was
leveled
,
topsoil
was
brought
in
and
T.
J.
Harrison
,
who
later
became
the
town
's
first
mayor
,
opened
the
first
grocery
store
in
0000
for
the
six
permanent
families
and
summer
residents
.

Significant
growth
did
n't
happen
until
after
0000
when
Myrtle
Beach
Air
Force
Base
was
reactivated
.

By
0000
,
its
reputation
as
a
family
beach
was
further
established
and
the
town
was
becoming
a
popular
place
to
retire
.

The
new
town
government
increased
police
protection
,
mosquito
and
sanitation
control
,
and
street
lights
and
zoning
ordinances
resulted
in
increased
property
values
.

Public
parking
and
walkways
to
the
beach
were
established
,
and
government
offices
were
constructed
.

Within
the
next
few
years
,
the
town
continued
to
grow
through
annexation
.

Improvements
were
made
to
streets
and
water
lines
and
business
and
residential
building
boomed
.

Surfside
Beach
,
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
Grand
Strand
,
became
one
of
the
fastest
growing
parts
of
the
country
.

Surfside
Beach
adopted
a
public-places
smoking
ban
which
took
effect
October
0
,
0000
.

Surfside
Beach
is
the
first
town
in
Horry
County
to
enact
such
a
ban
,
and
one
of
only
a
handful
in
South
Carolina
at
the
time
.

Hardeeville
is
a
city
in
Beaufort
and
Jasper
counties
in
the
U.S.
state
of
South
Carolina
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Hardeeville
is
included
within
the
Hilton
Head
Island
-
Bluffton
-
Beaufort
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

For
many
years
,
Hardeeville
billed
itself
as
the
"
Lowcountry
Host
"
due
to
the
prevalence
of
lodging
facilities
along
U.S.
Highway
00
and
later
Interstate
00
.

In
recent
years
,
the
city
has
expanded
its
economic
focus
due
to
population
growth
pressures
and
new
opportunities
.

Hardeeville
was
among
the
fastest
growing
cities
in
the
Southeast
in
the
0000s
as
new
and
proposed
development
began
to
take
shape
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
the
city
's
population
grew
nearly
00
percent
.

Over
that
same
time
period
the
city
limits
expanded
from
0.0
miles
to
just
under
00
square
miles
in
size
due
to
annexation
of
large
tracts
for
future
development
.

History
The
earliest
European
settlement
in
the
region
was
Purrysburg
,
a
former
Swiss
Huguenot
and
German
settlement
founded
in
0000
on
the
banks
of
the
Savannah
River
,
about
two
miles
(
0
km
)
northwest
of
the
current
city
's
center
.

The
settlement
ultimately
failed
as
disease
and
competition
from
growing
Savannah
proved
too
much
for
the
local
settlers
to
overcome
.

Many
left
the
immediate
area
,
moving
elsewhere
in
the
Lowcountry
region
(
including
a
new
hamlet
called
Switzerland
)
or
upriver
to
the
new
communities
of
Augusta
and
Hamburg
,
though
some
remained
.

The
area
saw
some
skirmishes
between
Union
and
Confederate
forces
during
the
Civil
War
.

The
Charleston
and
Savannah
Railway
(
today
's
CSX
railway
)
was
considered
a
prized
possession
and
major
strategic
goal
for
Union
forces
.

In
an
effort
to
defend
the
railroad
,
the
Battle
of
Honey
Hill
was
one
of
the
last
battles
won
by
southern
forces
in
late
0000
,
shortly
before
General
William
Sherman
attacked
South
Carolina
after
his
"
March
to
the
Sea
"
in
Georgia
.

The
area
within
the
city
was
settled
in
the
00th
century
by
Isaac
Hardee
,
a
native
North
Carolinean
.

Through
his
son
William
White
Hardee
's
efforts
,
a
depot
and
general
store
along
the
Charleston
to
Savannah
railway
opened
up
.

This
depot
and
the
surrounding
areas
became
collectively
known
as
Hardee
's
Station
,
and
eventually
as
Hardeeville
at
the
town
's
founding
in
0000
.

The
area
became
renowned
for
its
timber
operations
with
the
Argent
Lumber
Company
,
which
had
one
of
the
largest
logging
operations
in
the
world
centered
around
the
town
.

Unique
to
the
area
was
the
swamp
logging
procedure
that
was
utilized
,
which
made
operations
far
more
treacherous
than
standard
logging
.

Narrow-gauge
railroads
were
constructed
to
help
deliver
timber
to
a
processing
area
,
where
the
lumber
would
be
lifted
onto
standard-gauge
rail
cars
or
trucks
headed
to
all
parts
of
North
America
.

As
a
tribute
to
Argent
's
impact
on
the
community
,
the
city
was
donated
an
H.K.
Porter
0-0-0
steam
locomotive
(
c/n
0000
,
built
January
0000
)
,
Argent
Lumber
Company
Number
0
,
for
display
in
0000
.

Growth
continued
at
a
modest
pace
throughout
the
rest
of
the
00th
century
,
though
timbering
operations
were
gradually
scaled
back
as
overseas
lands
became
more
sought
after
due
to
lower
costs
and
more
standard
logging
procedures
.

In
spite
of
the
decline
of
the
logging
industry
,
the
construction
of
U.S.
Route
00
and
later
Interstate
00
provided
a
new
type
of
commerce
;
motorist
services
such
as
motels
,
restaurants
,
and
gas
stations
.

The
development
of
Hilton
Head
Island
as
a
resort
destination
had
a
further
impact
on
the
community
,
with
an
additional
interstate
exit
providing
greater
commercial
opportunity
and
affordable
costs
of
living
for
service
employees
who
moved
to
the
city
.

At
the
start
of
the
00st
century
,
development
pressures
along
U.S.
Route
000
corridor
became
a
central
concern
for
city
leaders
.

In
response
,
Hardeeville
began
to
annex
large
undeveloped
parcels
of
land
that
were
previously
held
by
timbering
and
paper
concerns
.

These
annexations
were
done
in
order
to
guide
new
growth
into
larger
planned
developments
,
increasing
the
city
limits
from
in
0000
to
over
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Core
Communities
became
the
first
company
to
sign
a
development
agreement
with
the
city
and
began
constructing
Tradition
Hilton
Head
.

In
the
following
years
,
other
developments
have
begun
or
announced
plans
at
developing
in
these
areas
.

Although
the
recession
beginning
in
late
0000
had
significantly
slowed
down
the
pace
of
development
,
the
city
has
continued
to
grow
due
to
continuous
commitments
from
existing
developers
,
and
new
investment
related
to
industrial
and
commercial
opportunities
.

These
investments
have
allowed
the
city
to
make
improvements
to
its
existing
areas
in
the
form
of
streetscaping
projects
,
improved
community
facilities
,
and
general
reinvestment
.

History
Camden
is
the
oldest
inland
city
and
fourth
oldest
city
in
South
Carolina
.

It
is
near
the
center
of
the
Cofitachequi
chiefdom
that
existed
in
the
0000s
.

In
0000
,
Camden
became
part
of
a
township
plan
ordered
by
King
George
II
.

Kershaw
County
’s
official
web
site
states
,
“
Originally
laid
out
in
0000
as
the
town
of
Fredericksburg
in
the
Wateree
River
swamp
(
south
of
the
present
town
)
when
King
George
II
ordered
eleven
inland
townships
established
along
South
Carolina
's
rivers
,
few
of
the
area
settlers
chose
to
take
lots
surveyed
in
the
town
,
choosing
the
higher
ground
to
the
north
.

The
township
soon
disappeared
.

”
In
0000
,
Joseph
Kershaw
,
from
Yorkshire
,
England
came
into
the
township
,
established
a
store
and
renamed
the
town
Pine
Tree
Hill
.

Camden
became
the
main
inland
trade
center
in
the
colony
.

Kershaw
suggested
that
the
town
be
renamed
Camden
,
in
honor
of
Lord
Camden
,
the
champion
of
colonial
rights
.

May
0000
brought
the
American
Revolution
(
a
true
civil
war
)
to
Charleston
,
South
Carolina
,
when
it
fell
under
the
Crown
's
control
.

Lord
Charles
Cornwallis
and
0,000
of
his
Loyalist
and
British
troops
marched
to
Camden
and
established
there
the
main
British
supply
post
for
the
Southern
campaign
.

The
Battle
of
Camden
,
the
worst
American
defeat
of
the
Revolution
,
was
fought
on
August
00
,
0000
near
Camden
,
and
on
April
00
,
0000
the
Battle
of
Hobkirk
Hill
was
fought
between
about
0,000
troops
led
by
General
Nathanael
Greene
and
000
Loyalists
and
British
soldiers
led
by
Lord
Francis
Rawdon
.

The
latter
battle
was
a
costly
win
for
the
British
,
and
forced
them
to
leave
Camden
and
retreat
to
the
coast
.

After
the
Revolution
,
Camden
's
prominence
and
wealth
grew
as
a
major
interior
trading
town
with
direct
ties
to
Charleston
and
the
world
.

Regional
products
,
augmented
with
goods
from
the
interior
of
North
Carolina
and
far
lands
to
the
west
were
transported
from
Camden
to
Charleston
on
flat-bottom
riverboats
that
plied
the
adjacent
Wateree
river
before
the
railroad
arrived
in
0000
.

Camden
,
although
not
involved
directly
with
the
Civil
War
,
did
send
six
generals
who
contributed
significantly
.

Hero
of
the
American
Civil
War
Richard
Rowland
Kirkland
-
'
The
Angel
of
Marye
's
Heights
'
-
is
interred
in
the
Old
Quaker
Cemetery
.

At
the
end
of
the
war
,
components
of
Sherman
's
army
burned
Confederate
and
nearby
properties
including
a
full
block
of
downtown
buildings
.

The
last
Federal
officer
killed
in
the
Civil
War
died
in
a
skirmish
near
Camden
.

Starting
in
the
mid-0000s
the
Camden
area
became
an
increasingly
popular
destination
for
wealthy
northern
families
to
spend
the
winter
.

Eventually
three
resort
hotels
provided
state
of
the
art
winter
tourism
activities
well
into
the
0000s
and
beyond
.

The
town
became
associated
with
many
equestrian
activities
,
and
is
now
the
home
of
the
third
oldest
active
polo
field
in
America
.

In
the
winter
,
more
than
0,000
thoroughbreds
call
the
area
home
.

According
to
Kershaw
County
’s
web
site
,
“
Horse
related
activities
became
very
popular
.

That
interest
in
equine
activities
has
continued
and
today
the
horse
industry
is
a
major
part
of
the
county
economy
.

For
that
reason
,
the
county
is
known
as
the
‘
Steeplechase
Capital
of
the
World
’
.

”
Because
of
its
long
history
and
many
years
of
wealthy
winter
visitors
and
deep-pocket
northern
owners
,
Camden
has
an
enviable
inventory
of
antebellum
homes
and
charm
that
remains
unique
among
towns
of
its
size
in
South
Carolina
and
elsewhere

Early
history
For
more
than
a
decade
before
Bishopville
got
its
name
in
honor
of
Jacques
Bishop
,
it
was
known
as
Singleton
’s
Crossroads
.

The
of
land
was
granted
to
Jacob
Chamber
by
the
state
of
South
Carolina
in
0000
.

Daniel
Carter
later
purchased
the
property
and
it
was
once
again
sold
to
William
Singleton
in
0000
.

This
was
where
the
name
Singleton
’s
Crossroads
originated
.

The
tavern
owned
by
Singleton
and
his
wife
sat
at
the
intersection
of
what
was
once
known
as
Mecklenburg
Road
,
now
named
Church
Street
,
and
McCallum
Ferry
Road
,
now
known
as
Main
Street
.

During
that
time
,
the
tavern
was
a
stopping
place
for
the
stage
coach
between
Georgetown
and
Charlotte
.

(
Now
this
intersection
involves
Highway
00
,
which
at
one
point
was
the
premier
north-south
route
from
New
York
to
Miami
.
)

In
0000
,
William
Singleton
died
,
leaving
his
wife
owner
of
the
tavern
until
her
death
in
0000
.

One
year
later
the
land
was
sold
to
Jacques
Bishop
.

During
this
time
period
the
area
around
present-day
Bishopville
was
said
to
be
composed
of
mostly
wilderness
,
with
only
a
few
scattered
,
primitive
houses
.

Although
voting
for
the
creation
of
Lee
County
and
for
making
Bishopville
its
county
seat
occurred
in
0000
,
there
was
a
delay
in
enacting
these
votes
until
February
0000
,
when
it
was
ruled
that
Bishopville
had
met
all
requirements
to
be
a
county
seat
.

This
led
to
the
marking
of
county
boundaries
,
which
were
along
Lynches
River
,
Black
River
,
Scape
Ore
Swamp
,
Sparrow
Swamp
,
Long
Branch
,
and
Screeches
Branch
,
as
well
as
the
development
of
a
courthouse
and
jail
.

As
surveyed
in
the
parent
counties
,
the
main
limits
followed
old
roads
and
artificial
limits
.

It
was
not
until
December
00
,
0000
that
Bishopville
received
the
good
news
of
their
success
.

To
celebrate
,
the
town
hosted
speeches
and
the
shooting
of
the
old
cannon
many
times
repeatedly
.

This
same
old
cannon
is
located
on
the
concrete
base
in
front
of
Lee
County
’s
Courthouse
in
Bishopville
.

Lee
County
has
historically
been
a
leader
in
cotton
production
in
the
state
and
is
the
home
of
the
South
Carolina
Cotton
Museum
.

Education

River
from
the
state
capital
of
Columbia
,
with
a
newly
annexed
section
on
the
Richland
County
side
awaiting

local
governments
jointly
developed
the
Riverwalk
along
the
Congaree
,
which
provides
walking
,
jogging

nature
observation
opportunities
.

Development
on
both
sides
of
the
river
is
an

factor
driving

While
Chapin
is
a
part
of
Lexington
County
,
the
creation
of
Lake
Murray
,
South
Carolina
by
the
Dreher
Shoals
Dam
cut
Chapin
off
from
the
rest
of
the
county
,
creating
something
of
an
exclave
.

History
Chapin
is
named
after
Martin
Chapin
who
traveled
south
from
Cortland
,
New
York
after
marrying
his
wife
Laura
.

After
Martin
Chapin
and
Laura
Anne
Benjamin
were
married
on
June
00
,
0000
.

The
married
coupled
moved
to
the
south
because
of
Martin
’s
health
.

He
had
a
lung
ailment
and
thought
that
moving
south
would
help
improve
his
lung
condition
.

Martin
Chapin
and
his
wife
were
living
in
Columbia
,
South
Carolina
when
his
doctor
suggested
he
to
move
to
the
Piney
Woods
area
.

He
bought
property
in
this
area
,
and
over
the
years
Martin
Chapin
bought
0,000
acres
in
Chapin
.

He
built
his
Chapin
home
and
the
Chapin
hotel
in
the
0000s
along
the
new
rail
line
that
ran
from
Columbia
,
South
Carolina
to
Laurens
,
South
Carolina
.

The
railroad
provided
a
way
to
trade
and
transport
goods
to
the
capital
city
,
Columbia
,
SC
.

Cotton
and
the
lumber
industry
were
flourishing
with
the
railroad
providing
transportation
.

After
Martin
’s
death
on
August
00
,
0000
Laura
Chapin
sold
their
Chapin
home
and
moved
into
the
Chapin
hotel
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
Job
S.
Wessinger
,
P.M.
Frick
,
and
J.
S.
Honeycut
founded
the
Bank
of
Chapin
.

One
year
later
the
building
for
the
bank
was
built
.

The
bank
was
prospering
with
help
from
the
railroad
.

During
World
War
I
,
Chapin
was
doing
well
economically
.

The
price
of
cotton
had
risen
and
the
farmers
were
making
plenty
of
money
.

As
a
result
,
The
Bank
of
Chapin
was
also
thriving
during
this
time
.

In
addition
,
the
first
high
school
was
built
in
0000
.

Slowly
the
businesses
in
Chapin
were
starting
to
experience
hard
times
nearing
the
0000s
.

On
Thursday
,
October
00
,
0000
the
Bank
of
Chapin
did
not
open
,
and
like
other
banks
around
the
world
,
the
Bank
of
Chapin
would
not
let
allow
customers
to
withdraw
their
money
.

Anybody
who
had
money
saved
in
the
bank
lost
that
money
due
to
the
crash
of
the
stock
market
,
later
known
as
the
start
of
the
Great
Depression
.

Another
disaster
to
hit
Chapin
was
the
building
of
the
dam
on
the
Saluda
River
that
would
result
in
the
building
of
a
lake
.

This
lake
would
take
over
most
of
the
Chapin
families
’
farm
and
homeland
.

The
building
of
the
dam
was
started
in
0000
.

In
the
midst
of
the
Great
Depression
Chapin
started
a
recreational
team
sport
of
baseball
.

In
0000
,
the
Dutch
Fork
League
was
formed
where
Chapin
had
its
own
team
.

This
team
helped
the
unemployed
men
occupy
their
time
during
these
difficult
times
.

These
baseball
games
attracted
thousands
of
people
.

The
midpoint
in
Chapin
’s
history
is
the
0000s
.

During
this
period
Chapin
grew
through
improvements
on
the
school
and
opening
new
businesses
.

One
new
business
that
came
to
Chapin
was
filling
stations
.

The
next
business
was
a
cabinet
shop
called
E.
A.
Frick
and
Son
.

Chapin
also
built
paved
roads
,
a
baseball
field
and
established
the
public
library
.

In
0000
the
first
post
office
building
was
constructed
,
along
with
new
telephone
services
.

The
0000s
were
about
new
and
better
services
.

Garbage
collection
was
an
issue
in
the
00s
,
so
the
town
government
bought
land
and
built
a
landfill
.

Transportation
was
the
next
service
provided
by
access
to
an
interstate
.

On
September
0
,
0000
a
section
of
the
interstate
was
opened
between
Columbia
and
Pomaria
,
South
Carolina
.

The
interstate
made
Chapin
more
accessible
.

Streets
in
town
were
also
improved
.

Another
improvement
of
the
00s
was
the
new
water
system
.

Later
during
0000
a
volunteer
fire
department
was
organized
.

Then
in
0000
,
the
town
had
its
first
ambulance
.

Chapin
started
also
started
growing
in
population
as
more
people
moved
to
Chapin
in
the
0000s
.

During
the
0000s
new
schools
were
built
.

Chapin
football
also
became
a
community
event
because
the
school
football
team
won
two
state
championships
in
0000
and
0000
.

Also
in
the
00s
churches
in
the
town
of
Chapin
were
growing
by
establishment
of
Chapin
Baptist
Church
,
St.
Francis
of
Assisi
Episcopal
Church
,
Our
Lady
of
the
Lake
Catholic
Church

Schools
History
The
first
school
in
Chapin
was
located
in
the
Chapin
house
.

In
0000
a
high
school
was
built
out
of
concrete
blocks
and
brick
.

In
0000
the
school
alma
mater
“
Chapin
,
Dear
Chapin
”
was
composed
by
Helen
Miller
.

This
alma
mater
is
the
same
one
used
at
Chapin
High
School
today
.

Chapin
schools
and
churches
were
the
center
of
life
in
town
according
to
historian
Addison
Bostain
.

Chapin
High
School
had
000
students
enrolled
in
0000
and
the
elementary
school
had
000
students
.

The
school
only
housed
00
grades
.

Chapin
High
School
had
been
built
in
separate
parts
since
0000
and
by
0000
the
high
school
still
did
not
have
a
gym
.

The
school
auditorium
was
home
to
both
the
theater
and
a
basketball
court
.

The
gym
nasium
was
not
built
until
0000
.

The
Chapin
community
built
the
gym
for
less
than
$
00,000
dollars
.

The
00th
grade
was
added
to
Chapin
High
School
in
0000
as
well
as
the
first
football
team
.

The
football
team
was
a
very
expensive
investment
,
so
in
0000
the
Irmo
and
Chapin
High
School
football
teams
were
combined
.

Together
they
were
known
as
the
Flying
Dutchmen
football
team
.

The
teams
separated
again
,
and
Chapin
has
had
its
own
team
since
0000
.

In
0000
a
new
high
school
was
built
with
much
better
facilities
.

The
school
had
new
labs
,
band
,
chorus
,
and
physical
educational
areas
.

In
addition
to
a
new
building
,
the
Chapin
football
team
became
a
powerhouse
for
football
in
state
of
South
Carolina
.

Cecil
Woolbright
became
Chapin
High
School
’s
head
football
coach
and
athletic
director
in
0000
.

The
Chapin
High
School
Eagles
won
two
state
championships
and
three
conference
titles
in
three
years
.

This
happened
in
0000
,
00
and
00
,
along
with
a
00
game
winning
streak
.

A
new
elementary
school
opened
in
August
0000
.

The
school
could
house
000
children
.

Churches
The
first
church
established
in
Chapin
was
Mt.
Horeb
Lutheran
Church
in
0000
.

The
Chapin
Methodist
Church
was
established
in
0000
,
but
was
not
within
town
limits
until
0000
.

Again
in
0000
,
Mt.
Zion
Baptist
Church
was
started
with
an
African
American
congregation
.

Another
church
for
African
Americans
was
St.
John
's
AME
church
,
which
is
older
than
Mt.
Zion
,
but
the
date
is
unknown
.

Much
later
in
0000
was
the
start
of
Chapin
Baptist
Church
.

Lake
Murray
Presbyterian
Church
was
organized
in
0000
.

Next
to
arrive
in
Chapin
was
St.
Francis
of
Assisi
Episcopal
Church
in
0000
.

Our
Lady
of
the
Lake
Catholic
Church
was
established
in
0000
.

Attractions
Lake
Murray
Chapin
is
often
referred
to
as
the
capital
of
Lake
Murray
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
work
on
the
dam
for
the
Saluda
River
was
started
.

The
construction
finished
on
the
June
00
,
0000
.

Chapin
families
who
had
lived
on
Chapin
land
for
over
000
years
had
to
sell
and
move
to
make
room
for
the
lake
that
was
a
result
of
the
dam
.

The
lake
was
to
spread
between
Dutch
Fork
and
Chapin
becoming
00
miles
wide
and
00
miles
long
.

The
earthen
dam
stands
over
000
feet
tall
and
runs
0.0
miles
across
.

Lake
Murray
has
over
000
miles
of
shoreline
and
covers
approximately
00,000
acres
.

The
dam
itself
takes
up
00
acres
.

The
dam
on
Lake
Murray
has
been
through
many
changes
since
it
was
originally
built
in
0000
.

In
0000
three
feet
was
added
to
the
dam
’s
height
to
help
flooding
issues
.

Much
later
in
the
0000s
SCE&G
added
a
sheet
piling
way
on
the
lakeside
of
the
highway
again
to
help
with
flooding
.

This
sheet
piling
way
raised
the
height
of
the
dam
again
.

The
latest
changes
to
the
dam
occurred
in
0000
when
the
backup
dam
was
built
.

The
backup
dam
was
built
for
more
protection
to
withstand
earthquakes
.

The
backup
dam
is
made
of
rock
and
concrete
to
withstand
the
weight
of
the
water
behind
the
dam
if
any
damage
were
to
occur
to
the
existing
dam
.

Lake
Murray
is
not
only
used

provide
electrical
power
for
surrounding

,
it
brings
fun
boating
activities
to
the
town

Sandstone
,
a

sandisized
minerals
such
as
quartz
or
feldspar
,
makes
up
the
softer
,
bottom
layers
of
the
formations
while
ironstone
accounts
for
the
harder
and
less-eroded
top
layers
.

Ironstone
,
also
a
sedimentary
rock
,
contains
iron
compounds
,
which
can
account
for
the
uneven
erosion
of
the
formations
at
Peachtree
Rock

Sandstone
(
sometimes
known
as
arenite
)
is
a
sedimentary
rock
composed
mainly
of
sand-sized
minerals
or
rock
grains
.

Most
sandstone
is
composed
of
quartz
and/or
feldspar

History
The
historic
town
of
Lexington
,
South
Carolina
,
is
a
direct
continuation
of
the
old
provincial
township
of
Saxe
Gotha
.

This
township
was
one
of
eleven
established
in
0000
by
the
colonial
government
of
King
George
II
to
encourage
settlement
of
backcountry
South
Carolina
and
serve
as
a
protective
buffer
between
powerful
Indian
tribes
to
the
west
and
the
older
settled
plantations
of
the
low
country
.

The
name
"
Saxe
Gotha
"
was
given
in
honor
of
the
marriage
of
the
King
's
son
,
Frederick
Louis
,
Prince
of
Wales
,
to
Princess
Augusta
of
Saxe-Gotha
.

The
territory
of
colonial
Saxe
Gotha
covered
most
of
present
day
Lexington
County
and
was
traversed
by
two
important
early
Indian
trails
,
the
Cherokee
Path
which
followed
roughly
modern
U.S.
Highway
#
000
and
the
Occaneechi
Path
,
today
U.S.
Highway
#
0
.

These
ancient
trading
paths
and
the
highways
that
later
developed
from
them
have
had
an
enormous
impact
on
the
historical
development
of
the
area
.

Most
of
the
early
settlers
came
from
various
cantons
,
principalities
and
city-states
of
Germany
and
Switzerland
.

Others
came
down
from
Pennsylvania
,
and
Virginia
.

Despite
the
disruptive
Cherokee
Indian
War
of
0000
and
the
"
Regulator
"
unrest
that
followed
,
the
township
flourished
as
a
largely
self-sufficient
area
of
small
scale
farming
operations
.

Major
crops
in
the
eighteenth
century
included
corn
,
wheat
,
tobacco
,
hemp
,
flax
,
beeswax
and
livestock
.

During
the
American
Revolution
,
several
skirmishes
occurred
in
the
area
,
among
them
being
the
Battle
of
Tarrar
Springs
,
which
was
fought
just
one
mile
east
of
Lexington
on
November
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
Lexington
County
was
established
,
with
the
township
of
Saxe
Gotha
renamed
to
"
Lexington
"
in
commemoration
of
the
Battles
of
Lexington
and
Concord
in
Massachusetts
.

The
county
's
first
courthouse
was
built
at
Granby
,
located
just
south
of
present
day
Cayce
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
the
county
was
organized
as
a
district
with
the
same
name
.

With
the
clearing
of
upriver
lands
for
the
spreading
cotton
culture
,
Granby
became
plagued
with
floods
.

The
district
seat
was
moved
in
0000
when
the
present
town
of
Lexington
was
laid
out
on
a
high
,
healthy
sand
ridge
near
Twelve
Mile
Creek
.

The
town
was
known
as
Lexington
Courthouse
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
since
in
the
first
few
years
of
its
existence
there
was
only
the
courthouse
with
few
residences
.

By
0000
,
when
it
was
incorporated
as
a
town
,
Lexington
boasted
a
diverse
population
of
lawyers
,
physicians
,
tradespeople
,
artisans
and
farmers
.

There
were
then
two
churches
,
several
schools
,
a
carriage
factory
,
a
saw
and
gristmill
,
a
tannery
,
livestock
yard
,
tin
and
blacksmiths
,
and
a
weekly
newspaper
.

The
major
crops
of
the
surrounding
countryside
were
mainly
cotton
,
corn
sweet
potatoes
and
lumber
.

Lexington
was
not
a
marketing
center
for
these
staples
,
but
did
serve
as
a
retail
market
for
manufactured
goods
purchased
wholesale
by
merchants
in
nearby
Columbia
.

In
0000
the
town
was
virtually
destroyed
by
occupying
Union
Army
forces
guarding
General
Sherman
's
western
flank
.

The
courthouse
,
district
jail
and
St.
Stephen
's
Lutheran
Church
were
put
to
the
torch
as
were
most
businesses
and
homes
.

The
small
farms
with
their
varied
crops
and
the
lumber
industry
stabilized
somewhat
the
economy
of
the
area
after
Reconstruction
years
.

The
completion
of
the
Columbia
to
Augusta
Railroad
just
after
the
Civil
War
and
the
construction
of
the
Lexington
Textile
Mill
in
0000
contributed
greatly
to
the
growth
of
the
town
itself
.

Disastrous
fires
in
0000
and
0000
on
Main
Street
resulted
in
the
construction
of
brick
buildings
,
many
of
which
are
standing
today
.

The
Town
of
Lexington
has
continued
to
be
the
political
center
of
Lexington
County
,
one
of
the
fastest
growing
areas
of
the
nation
.

With
new
major
highways
passing
nearby
,
the
town
continues
to
experience
phenomenal
growth
.

A
mountain
bike
or
mountain
bicycle
(
abbreviated
MTB
)
is
a
bicycle
created
for
off-road
cycling
.

Mountain
bikes
are
typically
ridden
on
single
track
trails
,
fire
roads
,
logging
roads
,
and
other
unpaved
environments
.

These
types
of
terrain
commonly
include
rocks
,
washouts
,
ruts
,
loose
sand
,
loose
gravel
,
roots
,
and
steep
grades
(
both
inclines
and
declines
)
.

Mountain
bikes
are
built
to
handle
this
terrain
and
the
obstacles
that
are
found
in
it
like
logs
,
vertical
drop
offs
,
and
smaller
boulders
.

Mountain
bike
construction
differs
from
a
typical
bicycle
in
many
ways
.

The
most
noticeable
differences
are
the
inclusion
of
suspension
on
the
frame
and
fork
,
larger
knobby
tires
,
more
durable
heavy
duty
wheels
,
more
powerful
brakes
,
and
lower
gear
ratios
needed
for
steep
grades
with
poor
traction
.

Since
the
development
of
the
sport
in
the
0000s
many
new
subtypes
of
mountain
biking
have
developed
,
such
as
cross-country
(
XC
)
biking
,
all-day
endurance
biking
,
Freeride
-
biking
,
downhill
mountain
biking
,
and
a
variety
of
track
and
slalom
competitions
.

Each
of
these
place
different
demands
on
the
bike
requiring
different
designs
for
optimal
performance
.

MTB
development
has
included
an
increase
in
gearing
,
up
to
00
speeds
,
to
facilitate
both
climbing
and
rapid
descents
.

However
,
recently
the
"
0
by
00
"
trend
has
emerged
,
simplifying
the
gearing
to
one
sprocket
in
the
front
and
00
in
the
rear
of
the
drive
train
.

This
allows
for
lighter
component
weights
while
still
maintaining
a
large
spread
of
gearing
options
.

Single
speed
mountain
bikes
are
also
becoming
more
and
more
popular
.

Other
developments
include
disc
instead
of
rim
brakes
and
00
"
tires
instead
of
the
traditional
00
"
tires
.

History
The
history
of
the
mountain
bike
includes
contributions
from
cyclo-cross
in
Europe
and
the
Roughstuff
Fellowship
in
the
UK
.

The
name
"
mountain
bike
"
first
appeared
in
print
in
0000
as
"
mountain
bicycle
"
.

The
mountain
bike
was
a
modified
heavy
cruiser
bicycle
used
for
freewheeling
down
mountain
trails
.

The
sport
became
popular
in
the
0000s
in
Marin
county
,
California
,
USA
.

The
0000
documentary
film
,
Klunkerz
:
A
Film
About
Mountain
Bikes
,
looks
at
this
period
of
off-road
cycling
in
detail
.

However
,
it
was
not
until
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
that
road
bicycle
companies
started
to
manufacture
mountain
bicycles
using
high-tech
lightweight
materials
,
such
as
M0
aluminium
.

The
first
mass
production
mountain
bike
was
the
Specialized
Stumpjumper
,
first
produced
in
0000
.

Throughout
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
mountain
biking
moved
from
a
little-known
sport
to
a
mainstream
activity
complete
with
an
international
racing
circuit
and
a
world
championship
.

Designs
Mountain
bikes
can
be
classified
into
four
categories
based
on
suspension
:
Discipline-oriented
designs
There
are
several
different
styles
of
mountain
biking
,
usually
defined
by
the
terrain
,
and
therefore
bikes
employed
.

Styles
of
mountain
bike
riding
and
mountain
bikes
have
evolved
rapidly
in
recent
years
leading
to
terms
such
as
Freeride
and
"
Trail
bike
"
being
used
to
categorise
mountain
bikes
.

Definitions
for
the
most
widely
used
terms
are
listed
below
.

Cross
country
(
XC
)
mountain
bikes
are
designed
primarily
around
the
discipline
of
cross
country
racing
.

Cross
country
racing
with
its
emphasis
on
climbing
as
well
as
speed
and
endurance
demands
bikes
that
are
both
lightweight
and
efficient
.

In
the
0000s
and
early
0000s
XC
mountain
bikes
typically
consisted
of
a
lightweight
steel
hardtail
frame
with
rigid
forks
.

Throughout
the
0000s
XC
bikes
evolved
to
incorporate
lightweight
aluminium
frames
and
short
travel
(
00
to
000
mm
)
front
suspension
forks
.

Recently
full
suspension
designs
have
become
more
prevalent
,
and
the
use
of
advanced
carbon
fiber
composites
has
allowed
bike
designers
to
produce
full
suspension
designs
under
00
kg
.

The
geometry
of
Cross
Country
bikes
favours
climbing
ability
and
fast
responses
over
descending
and
stability
and
as
a
result
typical
head
angles
are
00
–
00
°
.

Although
intended
for
off-road
use
,
Cross
Country
mountain
bikes
with
their
emphasis
on
lightweight
construction
are
not
designed
for
use
on
the
most
steep
or
severe
terrain
.
"

Trail
"
Bikes
are
a
development
of
XC
bikes
that
are
generally
used
by
recreational
mountain
bikers
either
at
purpose
built
"
Trail
centers
"
or
on
natural
off-road
trails
.

They
usually
have
around
0
"
(
000
–
000
mm
)
of
travel
,
weigh
,
and
have
geometries
slightly
slacker
than
XC
bikes
,
though
not
as
slack
as
AM
bikes
.

Examples
include
the
Giant
Trance
,
the
Trek
Fuel
EX
series
,
the
Specialized
Stumpjumper
FSR
,
and
others
.

With
less
of
an
emphasis
on
weight
,
Trail
Bikes
are
typically
built
to
handle
rougher
terrain
than
dedicated
XC
bikes
while
having
slacker
head
angles
(
00-00
°
)
which
provides
greater
stability
while
descending
.

Enduro/all-mountain
(
AM
)
bikes
bridge
the
gap
between
cross-country
and
freeride
bikes
,
such
as
the
Trek
Remedy
series
,
Specialized
enduro
,
typically
weighing
between
.

These
bikes
tend
to
feature
greater
suspension
travel
,
frequently
as
much
as
or
0
"
of
front
and
rear
travel
,
often
adjustable
on
newer
mid
-
and
high-end
bikes
.

They
are
designed
to
be
able
to
climb
and
descend
well
,
these
bikes
are
intended
to
be
ridden
on
all-day
rides
involving
steep
climbs
and
steep
descents
,
hence
the
term
'
all-mountain
'
.

Downhill
(
DH
)
bikes
typically
have
eight
or
more
inches
(
000
mm
)
of
suspension
travel
.

They
are
built
with
frames
that
are
strong
,
yet
light
,
which
often
requires
the
use
of
more
expensive
alloys
and
very
recently
,
carbon
fiber
.

In
the
past
few
years
,
lighter
downhill
bikes
have
been
getting
below
the
00
lbs
mark
(
00
kg
)
.

Due
to
their
typically
large
or
high
gears
,
long
,
plush
travel
and
slack
geometry
angles
,
Downhill
bikes
are
ideal
only
for
riding
down
dedicated
downhill
trails
and
race
courses
.

Downhill
bikes
have
the
most
sag
of
Mountain
Bikes
to
get
ample
traction
to
go
fast
over
bumpy
trails
.

Head
Angles
are
often
as
slack
as
00
degrees
.

Several
types
of
bicycle
speed
records
have
been
registered
downhill
.

Due
to
the
high-speed
nature
of
downhill
riding
most
bikes
only
have
one
chain
ring
in
the
front
,
a
large
bash
guard
and
a
chain
guide
,
though
many
racers
are
now
using
chain
guides
without
bash
guards
to
reduce
weight
.

Some
manufacturers
have
experimented
with
designs
featuring
internal
gearboxes
built
directly
into
the
frame
construction
.

This
modification
eliminates
the
need
for
the
rear
dérailleur
mechanism
but
has
not
been
embraced
due
to
durability
issues
with
the
gearbox
during
the
stresses
of
a
DH
race
.

Freeride
(
FR
)
mountain
bikes
are
similar
to
downhill
bikes
,
but
with
less
emphasis
on
weight
and
more
on
strength
.

Freeride
bikes
tend
to
have
ample
suspension
and
typically
have
at
least
of
travel
.

The
components
are
built
from
stronger
,
consequently
heavier
,
materials
.

They
can
be
ridden
uphill
,
but
are
inefficient
and
their
moderately
slack
head
tube
angles
make
them
difficult
to
maneuver
while
angled
up
a
hill
or
traveling
at
a
low
speed
.

They
are
effective
on
technical
downhill
trails
.

Frame
angles
are
typically
steeper
than
those
found
in
downhill
bikes
.

This
enhances
maneuverability
over
and
around
small

Freeride
bikes
typically
range
in
weight
from
.

The
most
durable
freeride
bikes
are
often
too
heavy
and
have
too
much
suspension
to
be
ridden
uphill
as
comfortably
as
other
less-sturdy
models
,
although
newer
,
more
expensive
bikes
come
with
suspension
specifically
designed
to
make
them
easier
to
ride
uphill
.

Trials
bikes
are
set
up
very
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
bicycle
trials
.

Two
varieties
of
trials
bike
exist
,
those
with
00
"
wheels
(
referred
to
as
'
stock
'
)
and
those
with
00
"
wheels
(
referred
to
as
'
mod
'
-
because
historically
they
were
modified
BMX
bikes
)
.

They
typically
have
no
suspension
at
all
,
though
some
still
make
use
of
some
form
of
it
.

Competition
rules
require
stock
bikes
to
have
multiple
gears
for
competition
,
but
most
riders
never
use
their
shifters
.

Competition
rules
do
not
require
mod
bikes
to
have
any
gears
.

Many
non-competitive
riders
run
single-speed
,
choosing
a
fairly
low-speed
,
high-torque
gear
.

Most
modern
trials
bikes
have
no
seat
at
all
,
as
the
rider
spends
all
of
his
time
out
of
the
saddle
.

These
bikes
are
significantly
lighter
than
almost
all
other
mountain
bikes
,
ranging
from
.

This
makes
maneuvering
the
bike
much
easier
.

Dirt
jumping
,
urban
and
street
mountain
bikes
lie
somewhere
in
between
a
BMX
bike
and
a
freeride
bike
.

They
are
typically
very
strong
bikes
,
with
of
front
suspension
,
and
rarely
any
rear
suspension
(
0
to
0
inches
,
00
to
000
mm
,
if
any
)
,
with
as
many
as
nine
gears
or
as
few
as
one
.

Tires
on
these
bikes
are
usually
fast-rolling
,
slick
or
semi-slicks
.

Dirt
Jumpers
usually
sport
a
geometry
of
00-00
"
tires
,
as
well
as
a
bashring
(
a
type
of
bashguard
)
replacing
the
largest
ring
on
the
crankset
.

Dirt
jumpers
usually
have
low
seatpost
s
and
oversized
handlebars
.

Most
dirt
jumpers
have
an
extended
rear
brake
cable
installed
and
have
no
front
brake
,
which
allows
the
rider
to
spin
the
handle
bars
without
tangling
the
brake
cables
.

Single-speed
(
SS
)
mountain
bikes
have
one
set
gear
ratio
.

The
gear
ratio
chosen
depends
on
the
terrain
being
ridden
,
the
strength
and
skill
of
the
rider
,
and
the
size
of
the
bike
(
a
bike
with
00
"
wheels
often
requires
a
different
gearing
than
a
bike
with
standard
00
"
wheels
)
.

Often
single-speeds
are
fully
rigid
,
steel-framed
bikes
.

These
are
typically
ridden
by
very
fit
individuals
on
mild
to
moderate
cross
country
terrain
.

Mountain
cross
or
"
Four-cross
"
(
0X
)
is
a
relatively
new
style
of
riding
where
four
bikers
race
downhill
on
a
prepared
,
BMX
like
,
track
,
simply
trying
to
get
down
first
.

These
bikes
are
generally
either
full
suspension
with
of
travel
,
or
hardtails
,
and
have
,
typically
,
quite
strong
frames
.

They
run
a
chainguide
on
front
and
gears
on
the
back
.

They
have
slack
head
angles
,
short
chainstays
and
low
bottom
brackets
to
aid
in
cornering
and
acceleration
.

Dual
slalom
(
DS
)
is
similar
to
Four-cross
,
but
instead
of
four
competing
cyclists
during
a
race
,
there
are
only
two
.

Courses
usually
have
a
lane
for
each
rider
,
though
some
combine
to
a
single
lane
in
places
or
even
for
much
of
the
course
.

The
courses
are
in
general
more
technical
with
smaller
jumps
than
Four-cross
courses
.

Dual
Slalom
races
originally
took
place
on
grass
slopes
with
gates
and
minimal
jumps
,
but
are
now
held
on
man-made
courses
.

Dual
slalom
riders
will
usually
use
the
same
bikes
that
Four-cross
riders
use
.

Indycross
(
IX
)
is
essentially
a
Mountain
Cross
event
featuring
a
wide
variety
of
features
run
by
one
competitor
per
time
.

North
Shore
bikes
are
much
like
freeride
bikes
in
their
geometry
and
downhill
bikes
in
their
component
makeup
.

Because
north
shore
stunts
have
evolved
to
not
only
include
simple
and
complex
bridges
but
also
large
drops
and
high-speed
descents
through
a
series
of
stunts
north
shore
bikes
commonly
have
as
much
travel
as
downhill
and
freeride
bikes
,
however
with
much
more
nimble
and
maneuverable
frame
designs
,
and
often
lighter
weight
.

Circle
dirt
track
racing
In
this
class
of
racing
any
kind
of
bikes
are
used
,
most
commonly
a
hard
tail
mountain
bike
with
front
suspension
.

Many
different
modifications
are
made
to
track
racing
bikes
,
such
as
reducing
bike
weight
,
increasing
brake
power
,
trying
different
cambers
(
so
that
when
the
bike
leans
the
tire
is
more
level
with
the
track
thus
creating
more
grip
)
,
and
trying
different
gear
ratios
.

It
should
be
noted
that
in
the
early
days
of
mountain
biking
,
all
mountain
bikes
were
somewhat
custom
,
home-built
machines
,
and
were
used
for
any
number
of
stunts
,
tricks
,
racing
or
other
activities
.

The
general
design
of
the
bikes
were
similar
.

As
the
sport
grew
,
more
specialized
designs
and
equipment
were
introduced
.

The
further
market
segmentation
beyond
simple
front
suspension
XC
began
to
occur
in
the
mid-0000s
,
as
large
bicycle
and
equipment
manufacturers
were
able
to
cater
specifically
to
changing
demands
.

Modern
designs
Gears
From
the
0000s
to
the
late
0000s
,
mountain
bikes
often
had
either
00
,
00
,
or
00
speeds
,
with
0
gears
in
the
front
and
0
,
0
,
or
0
gears
at
the
rear
wheel
.

Thirty-speed
mountain
bikes
have
previously
been
unworkable
,
as
the
mud-shedding
capabilities
of
a
ten-speed
cassette
,
and
the
intricacies
of
a
ten-speed
rear
dérailleur
have
never
been
suitable
.

However
,
many
pro-level
mountain
bikers
have
taken
to
using
a
narrower
00-speed
road
chain
with
a
0-speed
setup
in
an
effort
to
reduce
the
weight
of
their
bike
.

In
early
0000
,
component
group
SRAM
announced
their
release
of
their
XX
groupset
,
which
uses
a
two-speed
front
dérailleur
,
and
a
ten-speed
rear
dérailleur
and
cassette
,
similar
to
that
of
a
road
bike
.

Mud-shedding
capabilities
of
their
ten-speed
XX
cassette
are
made
suitable
for
MTB
use
by
extensive
CNC
machining
of
the
cassette
.

Due
to
the
time
and
cost
involved
in
such
a
product
,
they
were
only
aimed
at
top-end
XC-racers
.

However
,
00-speed
has
become
the
norm
by
0000
and
the
market
leader
Shimano
even
offers
its
budget
groupset
"
Alivio
"
in
a
00-speed
version
.

In
July
0000
,
SRAM
announced
a
0x00
drivetrain
called
XX0
that
does
not
make
use
of
a
front
dérailleur
for
lighter
weight
and
simplicity
.

Geometry
The
critical
angles
in
bicycle
geometry
are
the
head
angle
(
the
angle
of
the
head
tube
)
,
and
the
seat
tube
angle
(
the
angle
of
the
seat
tube
)
.

These
angles
are
measured
from
the
horizontal
,
and
drastically
affect
the
rider
position
and
performance
characteristics
of
the
bicycle
.

Mountain
bike
geometry
will
often
feature
a
seat
tube
angle
around
00
degrees
,
with
a
head
tube
angle
of
anywhere
from
00-00
degrees
.

The
intended
application
of
the
bike
affects
its
geometry
very
heavily
.

In
general
,
steeper
angles
(
closer
to
00
degrees
from
the
horizontal
)
are
more
efficient
for
pedaling
up
hills
and
make
for
sharper
handling
.

Slacker
angles
(
leaning
farther
from
the
vertical
)
are
preferred
for
high
speeds
and
downhill
stability
.

Suspension
In
the
past
mountain
bikes
had
a
rigid
frame
and
fork
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
first
mountain
bikes
with
suspension
forks
were
introduced
.

This
made
riding
on
rough
terrain
easier
and
less
physically
stressful
.

The
first
suspension
forks
had
about
0
½
to
0
inches
(
00
to
00
mm
)
of
suspension
travel
.

Forks
are
now
available
with
of
travel
or
more
(
see
above
under
"
Design
.
"
)

Bikes
with
front
suspension
and
rigid
,
non-suspended
rear
wheels
,
or
hardtails
became
popular
nearly
overnight
.

While
the
hardtail
design
has
the
benefits
of
lower
cost
,
less
maintenance
,
and
better
pedaling
efficiency
,
it
is
slowly
losing
popularity
due
to
improvements
in
full
suspension
designs
.

Many
new
mountain
bikes
integrate
a
"
full
suspension
"
design
known
as
Dual
Suspension
or
"
full-susser
"
,
meaning
that
both
the
front
and
rear
wheel
are
fitted
with
a
shock
absorber
in
some
form
as
the
wheel
attaches
to
the
bike
.

This
provides
a
smoother
ride
as
the
front
and
rear
wheels
can
now
travel
up
and
down
to
absorb
the
force
of
obstacles
striking
the
tires
.

Dual
suspension
bikes
of
a
similar
quality
are
considerably
more
expensive
,
but
this
price
increase
brings
an
enormous
off-road
performance
upgrade
as
dual
suspension
bikes
are
much
faster
on
downhill
and
technical/rough
sections
,
than
other
forms
of
the
mountain
bike
.

This
is
because
when
the
wheel
strikes
an
obstacle
its
tendency
is
to
bounce
up
.

Due
to
some
forward
energy
being
lost
in
the
upward
movement
some
speed
is
lost
.

Dual
Suspension
bikes
solve
this
problem
by
absorbing
this
upward
force
and
transmit
it
into
the
shocks
of
the
front
and
rear
wheels
,
drastically
decreasing
the
translation
of
forward
momentum
into
useless
upward
movement
.

Many
bikes
have
dual
suspension
including
downhill
,
freeride
and
Disadvantages
of
rear
suspension
are
increased
weight
,
increased
price
,
and
with
some
designs
,
decreased
pedaling
efficiency
,
this
is
especially
noticeable
when
cycling
on
roads
and
hard
trails
.

At
first
,
early
rear
suspension
designs
were
overly
heavy
,
and
susceptible
either
to
pedaling-induced
bobbing
or
lockout
at
certain
points
of
the
suspension
arc
or
travel
,
this
is
still
the
case
of
many
bottom
end
bikes
.

One
of
the
most
popular
rear
suspension
designs
to
solve
these
issues
has
been
the
'
Horst
Link
'
which
first
appeared
with
the
AMP
series
of
bikes
,
and
was
later
adopted
by
Specialized
and
many
other
mountain
bike
manufacturers
.

Disc
brakes
Most
new
mountain
bikes
use
disc
brakes
.

They
offer
much
improved
stopping
power
(
less
lever
pressure
is
required
providing
greater
braking
modulation
)
over
rim
brakes
under
all
conditions
especially
adverse
conditions
,
because
they
are
located
at
the
center
of
the
wheel
(
on
the
wheel
hub
)
.

They
therefore
remain
drier
and
cleaner
than
wheel
rims
,
which
are
more
readily
soiled
or
damaged
.

The
disadvantage
of
disc
brakes
is
their
increased
cost
and
often
greater
weight
.

Well
set
up
V
brakes
or
older
cantilever
set-ups
,
under
normal
road
conditions
can
be
equally
,
if
not
more
effective
in
stopping
power
.

Disc
brakes
do
not
allow
heat
to
build
up
in
the
tires
on
long
descents
instead
heat
builds
up
in
the
rotor
,
which
can
become
extremely
hot
.

Wheel
and
tire
design
Most
mountain
bikes
use
00-inch
(
000
mm
)
bicycle
wheel
s
,
though
some
models
offer
00
or
00
inch
(
000
or
000
mm
)
wheels
,
and
00.0
is
currently
appearing
.

Bicycle
wheel
sizes
are
not
precise
measurements
:
a
00
inch
mountain
bike
wheel
actually
has
a
)
bead
seat
diameter
(
the
term
,
bead
seat
diameter
(
BSD
)
,
is
used
in
the
ETRTO
tire
and
rim
sizing
system
)
.

000
mm
wheels
are
standard
on
road
bikes
and
are
commonly
known
as
000c
.

In
some
countries
,
mainly
in
Continental
Europe
,
000c
(
000
mm
)
wheels
are
commonly
called
00
inch
wheels
.

00
inch
wheels
are
used
for
dirt
jumping
bikes
and
sometimes
on
freeride
bikes
,
rear
wheel
only
,
as
this
makes
the
bike
more
maneuverable
.

00
inch
wheels
were
once
used
for
only
Cross
Country
purposes
,
but
are
now
becoming
more
commonplace
in
other
disciplines
of
mountain
biking
.

A
mountain
bike
with
00
"
wheels
is
often
referred
to
as
a
00er
.

Wheels
come
in
a
variety
of
widths
,
ranging
from
standard
rims
suitable
for
use
with
tires
in
the
00
in
x
0.00
in
to
0.00
in
(
000
x
00
to
00
mm
)
size
,
to
widths
popular
with
freeride
and
downhill
bicycles
.

Although
heavier
wheelsets
are
favored
in
the
freeride
and
downhill
disciplines
,
advances
in
wheel
technology
continually
shave
weight
off
strong
wheels
.

This
is
highly
advantageous
as
rolling
weight
greatly
affects
handling
and
control
,
which
are
very
important
to
the
technical
nature
of
freeride
and
downhill
riding
.

The
widest
wheel
widths
are
sometimes
used
by
icebikers
who
use
their
mountain
bikes
for
winter-time
riding
in
snowy
conditions
.

Manufacturers
produce
bicycle
tire
s
with
a
wide
variety
of
tread
patterns
to
suit
different
needs
.

Among
these
styles
are
:
slick
street
tires
,
street
tires
with
a
center
ridge
and
outer
tread
,
fully
knobby
,
front-specific
,
rear-specific
,
and
snow
studded
.

Some
tires
can
be
specifically
designed
for
use
in
certain
weather
(
wet
or
dry
)
and
terrain
(
hard
,
soft
,
muddy
,
etc.
)
conditions
.

Other
tire
designs
attempt
to
be
all-around
applicable
.

Within
the
same
intended
application
,
more
expensive
tires
tend
to
be
lighter
and
have
less
rolling
resistance
.

Sticky
Rubber
tires
are
now
available
for
use
on
freeride
and
downhill
bikes
.

While
these
tires
wear
down
more
quickly
,
they
provide
greater
traction
in
all
conditions
,
especially
during
cornering
.

Tires
and
rims
are
available
in
either
tubed
or
tubeless
designs
,
with
tubeless
tire
s
recently
(
0000
)
gaining
favor
for
their
pinch
flat
resistance
.

Tubeless
tires
can
also
be
run
at
lower
air
pressures
to
improve
traction
and
increasing
rolling
resistance
.

Popular
tire
manufacturers
include
Wilderness
Trail
Bikes
,
Schwalbe
,
Maxxis
,
Nokian
,
Michelin
,
Continental
,
Tioga
,
Kenda
,
Hutchinson
Specialized
and
Panaracer
.

Tandems
Mountain
bikes
are
available
in
tandem
configurations
.

For
example
,
Cannondale
and
Santana
Cycles
offer
ones
without
suspension
,
while
Ellsworth
,
Nicolai
,
and
Ventana
manufacture
tandems
with
full
suspension
.

in
0000
and
named
after
Thomas
Bennett
,
Jr.
,
then
governor
of
South
Carolina
.

In
the
same
year
,
the
S.C.
General
Assembly
authorized
the
relocation
of
the
courthouse
from
the
eastern
bank
of
the
Great
Pee
Dee
River
to
a
more
central
location
,
selecting
a
apple
orchard
located
on
a
bluff
above
Crooked
Creek
for
the
new
courthouse
,
designed
by
South
Carolina
architect
Robert
Mills
.

Streets
were
then
developed
spreading
out
from
the
square
,
one
of
the
state
's
largest
.

In
0000
,
the
Mills
building
was
replaced
.

In
0000
,
during
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
city
was
occupied
by
Union
troops
.

During
this
time
,
the
Jennings-Brown
House
and
the
first
County
Courthouse
was
used
as
the
headquarters
for
General
William
T.
Sherman
during
the
Civil
War
.

The
new
courthouse
escaped
burning
,
making
it
one
of
South
Carolina
's
few
county
seats
with
records
accessible
for
genealogical
research
dating
back
to
0000
.

In
0000
,
another
Second
Empire
style
courthouse
was
erected
on
the
site
and
is
the
central
portion
of
the
present
building
.

Two
story
red
brick
wings
and
the
present
clock
steeple
designed
by
Bennettsville
architect
Henry
D.
Harrall
were
added
during
the
0000-0000
remodeling
.

In
0000
,
Duncan
Donald
McColl
brought
the
first
railroad
,
bank
and
textile
mills
to
Bennettsville
.

The
economy
boomed
during
this
"
king
cotton
"
era
.

The
city
became
one
of
the
richest
agricultural
areas
in
the
state
.

Because
of
this
importance
to
its
early
history
,
the
State
of
South
Carolina
gave
Bennettsville
the
designation
of
its
first
"
G.R.E.A.T.
Town
"
(
Governor
's
Rural
Economic
Achievement
Trophy
)

History
&
Culture
The
mountain
is
a
monadnock
which
is
an
isolated
mountain
or
rock
that
has
resisted
the
process
of
erosion
and
stands
alone
in
an
otherwise
flat
area
.

Early
history
The
mountain
was
referred
to
as
Ruff
's
Mountain
until
sometime
in
the
0000s
.

It
was
part
of
Lexington
County
until
0000
,
when
the
current
border
was
established
.

Property
in
this
area
was
not
recorded
in
the
Newberry
County
tax
records
until
some
time
in
the
0000s
.

The
Eastern
side
of
the
mountain
was
once
owned
by
Sam
Birge
,
and
later
Arthur
Kohn
.

It
would
change
hands
between
the
two
several
times
before
coming
into
the
possession
of
the
Derrick
family
in
the
0000s
.

The
other
side
,
including
what
became
the
town
of
Little
Mountain
,
was
owned
by
Abraham
N.
Boland
.

The
Town
Frederick
H.
Dominick
was
appointed
as
postmaster
in
May
0000
.

Abraham
Noah
Boland
was
appointed
as
postmaster
of
the
Little
Mountain
Post
Office
in
0000
.

The
town
was
founded
around
a
railroad
station
in
0000
:
Boland
's
farm
became
the
site
of
the
depot
when
the
C.
N.
&
L
Railroad
(
Columbia
,
Newberry
,
&
Laurens
Railroad
Company
)
began
operation
.

The
town
was
incorporated
and
Boland
became
the
first
mayor
of
the
town
.

Today
,
Boland
is
considered
the
"
Father
of
Little
Mountain
.
"

Early
residents
were
farmers
of
corn
,
cotton
and
grain
.

The
town
has
become
a
bedroom
community
for
Columbia
,
the
state
capital
,
00
miles
to
the
southeast
.

Education
In
0000
,
a
school
was
opened
in
a
tenant
house
and
taught
by
the
pastor
of
Holy
Trinity
Lutheran
Church
,
Rev.
S.
L.
Nease
.

Later
a
one-room
school
building
was
built
on
an
acre
of
land
donated
by
Noah
Boland
.

Increased
enrollment
brought
a
two-room
building
and
finally
,
in
0000
the
plans
were
made
to
build
the
present
Little
Mountain
Elementary
School
.

Several
additions
and
modifications
have
been
made
to
the
building
since
the
original
construction
.

Little
Mountain
Town
Reunion
Every
year
,
the
town
of
Little
Mountain
hosts
the
"
Little
Mountain
Town
Reunion
"
during
the
month
of
August
.

The
Little
Mountain
Reunion
is
one
of
South
Carolina
’s
oldest
folk
festivals
.

It
began
in
0000
,
as
an
effort
by
a
person
connected
to
Newberry
College
for
encouraging
local
class
reunions
,
the
hope
being
that
it
would
generate
interest
in
the
new
college
.

The
college
experienced
a
number
of
set-backs
since
its
organization
;
misused
by
Federal
troops
during
the
Civil
War
,
moved
to
Walhalla
in
the
upper
part
of
South
Carolina
,
and
finally
back
to
Newberry
,
the
county
seat
of
Newberry
County
.

Because
most
people
traveled
either
on
two
or
four
feet
due
to
the
lack
of
trains
and
automobiles
,
meeting
places
were
selected
mainly
on
the
convenience
of
their
locationThe
Newberry
Observer
documents
that
in
0000
this
group
met
first
at
Corinth
Lutheran
Church
across
the
Saluda
River
.

It
was
probably
in
the
next
year
,
or
possibly
the
following
year
,
that
the
officials
decided
to
try
the
site
at
Little
Mountain
.

The
event
was
so
successful
that
it
was
decided
by
those
present
that
each
year
a
Newberry
College
Reunion
would
be
held
at
the
foot
of
Little
Mountain
.

The
even
took
place
on
property
recently
purchased
by
A.
N.
Boland
from
Frederick
Henry
Dominick
.

He
was
quite
agreeable
to
this
plan
and
for
many
years
prepared
and
sold
barbecue
,
rice
and
hash
,
lemonade
,
and
ice-cream
to
those
who
attended
.

For
those
who
wished
to
bring
along
their
own
picnic
,
tables
were
erected
between
trees
.

Every
year
,
people
came
riding
in
on
horseback
or
in
buggies
,
wagons
,
carts
,
etc.
.

Then
in
0000
when
the
first
train
came
through
Little

typical
Little
Mountain
Reunion
afforded
not
only
a
time
to
renew
friendships
made
at
school
but
the
time
to
catch
up
on
political
thinking
and
the
state
of
politics
in
the
Dutch
Fork
.

A
welcoming
address
by
the
president
of
Newberry
College
made
everyone
feel
at
home
and
gave
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
state
of
the
college
.

These
reunions
became
a
traditional
part
of
the
community
,
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
Dutch
Fork
area
,
and
were
eagerly
anticipated
by
everybody
in
the
area
.

The
simple
pleasures
afforded
here
along
with
the
community
spirit
helped
maintain
the
reunion
until
the
eve
of
World
War
II
.

In
0000
,
the
Town
of
Little
Mountain
and
the
Ruritan
Club
decided
to
renew
the
reunion
as
a
bicentennial
project
.

The
idea
generated
a
great
deal
of
enthusiasm
in
the
town
.

The
festival
was
such
a
success
that
the
Little
Mountain
Association
was
formed
and
the
Little
Mountain
Reunion
again
became
an
annual
affair
.

The
0000
Reunion
was
cancelled
,
reportedly
due
to
contract
and
liability
issues
between
the
Little
Mountain
Town
Council
and
the
Little
Mountain
Reunion
Association
.

History
Seneca
was
founded
as
Seneca
City
and
named
for
a
nearby
Native
American
village
and
the
Seneca
River
.

The
town
was
located
at
the
intersection
of
the
Blue
Ridge
Railroad
and
the
newly
built
Atlanta
and
Charlotte
Air
Line
Railroad
.

Both
lines
are
now
part
of
the
Norfolk
Southern
Railway
.

A.
W.
Thompson
and
J.
J.
Norton
,
who
were
locating
engineer
s
for
the
Air
Line
Railroad
,
purchased
the
land
from
Col.
Brown
of
Anderson
,
South
Carolina
.

A
stake
marking
the
center
of
town
was
driven
into
the
intersection
of
the
railroad
tracks
and
the
current
Townville
Street
.

The
land
was
divided
into
lots
for
one-half
mile
from
the
stake
.

An
auction
was
held
on
August
00
,
0000
.

The
town
was
given
a
charter
by
the
state
legislature
on
March
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
name
was
changed
to
Seneca
.

Seneca
developed
as
a
marketing
and
shipping
point
for
cotton
.

During
the
harvest
,
wagons
bringing
cotton
would
line
up
for
blocks
from
the
railroad
station
.

A
passenger
terminal
,
several
hotels
,
and
a
park
were
built
near
the
railroad
tracks
.

Recently
,
this
park
was
named
the
Norton-Thompson
Park
in
honor
of
its
founders
.

The
first
school
was
built
in
0000
.

The
community
was
the
home
of
the
Seneca
Institute
-
Seneca
Junior
College
,
which
was
an
African-American
school
from
0000
to
0000
.

Textile
mills
came
in
to
the
area
with
the
construction
of
a
plant-and-mill
village
by
the
Courtenay
Manufacturing
Company
in
Newry
on
the
Little
River
in
0000
.

W.L.
Jordon
built
another
textile
plant
and
mill
village
east
of
Seneca
.

This
village
has
been
called
Jordania
,
Londsdale
,
and
Utica
as
the
ownership
of
the
plant
changed
.

The
J.
P.
Stevens
Plant
,
which
was
later
called
the
Westpoint
Stevens
Plant
,
was
a
large
integrated
textile
mill
built
on
Lake
Hartwell
.

Many
other
textile
mills
came
to
the
area
.

These
plants
were
the
main
industry
for
Seneca
for
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
.

Nearly
all
these
textile
plants
have
been
closed
.

With
the
construction
of
Lake
Hartwell
in
0000
,
Lake
Keowee
in
0000
,
and
Lake
Jocassee
in
0000
,
Seneca
and
the
area
saw
dramatic
changes
.

The
Oconee
Nuclear
Station
was
built
on
Lake
Keowee
.

The
recreation
provided
by
the
lakes
and
other
attractions
such
as
nearby
Clemson
University
brought
many
retirees
from
other
parts
of
the
country
.

Retirement
communities
have
been
built
in
the
area
.

History
Interest
in
building
a
town
at
the
intersection
of
present
day
US
000
(
Charleston
Highway
)
and
S.C.
000
(
Branchville
-
Providence
Roads
)
was
evidenced
in
the
acquisition
of
substantial
properties
of
the
Reddick
A.
Bowman
estate
by
one
Samuel
W.
Dibble
,
Sr.
of
Orangeburg
,
SC
in
0000
.

The
Smoak
Tramway
,
a
six-mile
logging
railroad
extending
from
Branchville
toward
north
Four
Holes
Swamp
which
was
chartered
in
0000
,
was
also
targeted
for
acquisition
by
Mr.
Dibble
's
associate
,
Thomas
M.
Raysor
,
who
operated
the
Raysor
Mill
near
Stokes
.

These
actions
,
aimed
at
developing
and
exploiting
the
agricultural
and
lumbering
potential
of
an
area
that
had
remained
rather
dormant
since
the
American
Civil
War
,
were
taking
place
in
the
late
0000s
.

These
represented
the
prelude
to
the
chartering
of
the
future
Town
of
Bowman
and
the
transportation
and
land
development
organizations
and
operations
which
preceded
its
chartering
.

The
site
chosen
for
Bowman
was
actually
situated
in
the
center
of
a
rice
farming
country
,
later
transformed
into
a
major
cotton
producing
area
where
the
land
has
a
clay
sub-soil
,
ideal
for
this
and
other
crops
.

it
was
located
on
an
old
road
that
was
traveled
in
colonial
days
by
people
going
from
Charleston
to
Orangeburg
,
and
which
was
once
alleged
to
have
been
known
as
Oak
Ridge
,
a
plateau
about
ten
miles
long
and
five
miles
wide
.

One
of
the
oldest
remaining
,
operating
,
companies
located
in
Bowman
,
South
Carolina
,
is
V.P.
Kiser
Lumber
Company
.

V.P.
Kiser
Lumber
company
now
produces
pine
shingles
,
among
other
products
.

Fun

Some
wood
from

Lumber
Company
was
used
to
build
Bowman
's
UFO
welcoming
center
.

Post
Office
In
the
early
years
immediately
prior
to
the
founding
of
Bowman
,
mail
service
amounted
to
once
or
twice-a-week
deliveries
from
Orangeburg
by
horse
and
buggy
to
outlying
communities
,
such
as
Rileys
,
Connors
and
Ruples
.

The
first
post
office
in

was
located
at
Railroad
Avenue
and
Ott
Street
(
later
Main
Street
)
in
the
store
of
John
W.
Berry
,
a
pioneer
merchant
,
and
he
served
as
the
first
postmaster
.

The
building
also
served
as
a
residence
,
and
it
had
the
first
telephone
between
Bowman
and
Branchville
.

The
postal
system
of
those
early
years
in
Bowman
's
history
involved
horse
and
buggy
deliveries
about
twice
a
week
from
Orangeburg
,
and
patrons
from
both
town
and
surrounding
areas
had
to
pick
up
their
mail
from
the
post
office
until
rural
routes
and
carriers
were
organized
to
deliver
mail
outside
the
town
limits
in
the
early
0000s
.

Three
rural
routes
were
operational
by
0000
.

The
earliest
carriers
of
record
were
W.
H.
Dukes
,
W.
L.
Bishop
,
O.
P.
Evans
and
Andrew
Stroman
,
Sr.
.

A
fourth
route
was
later
added
to
serve
the
surrounding
area
,
since
reduced
to
three
,
and
finally
to
the
current
two
routes
.

History
Orangeburg
,
named
for
William
IV
,
Prince
of
Orange
,
the
son-in-law
of
King
George
II
,
of
England
,
was
first
settled
by
Europeans
in
0000
when
the
Indian
trader
,
George
Sterling
,
set
up
a
post
there
.

To
encourage
settlement
,
the
General
Assembly
of
the
Province
of
South
Carolina
in
0000
made
the
area
into
a
township
in
the
shape
of
a
parallelogram
00
x
.

In
0000
,
a
colony
of
000
Swiss
,
German
and
Dutch
immigrants
formed
a
community
near
the
banks
of
the
North
Edisto
River
.

The
site
was
attractive
because
of
the
fertile
soil
and
the
abundance
of
wildlife
.

The
river
provided
an
outlet
to
the
port
of
Charleston
for
the
area
's
agriculture
and
lumber
products
.

The
town
soon
became
a
well-established
and
successful
colony
,
composed
chiefly
of
small
yeomen
farmers
.

The
church
played
an
important
role
in
the
early
life
of
Orangeburg
.

The
first
church
was
established
by
a
German
Lutheran
congregation
.

It
later
identified
as
an
Anglican
Church
,
which
was
the
established
church
and
exempt
from
colonial
taxation
.

The
church
building
was
erected
prior
to
0000
in
the
center
of
the
village
and
was
destroyed
during
the
Revolutionary
War
.

A
subsequent
church
building
was
used
as
a
smallpox
hospital
by
General
William
Tecumseh
Sherman
during
the
Civil
War
.

In
the
nineteenth

History
What
was
first
named
Rockville
in
0000
became
Pickensville
the
next
year
and
,
later
,
Easley
in
the
late
0000s
.

During
its
short
history
,
Pickensville
played
a
major
role
in
the
development
of
upstate
South
Carolina
.

In
0000
it
held
the
distinction
of
being
the
district
seat
for
Washington
District
which
was
composed
of
Greenville
and
Pendleton
Counties
.

In
0000
the
Washington
District
was
divided
into
the
Greenville
and
Pendleton
Districts
with
Pickensville
maintaining
its
place
as
the
district
seat
for
Pendleton
.

Pendleton
District
was
composed
of
what
would
later
be
known
as
Pickens
,
Anderson
,
and
Oconee
Counties
.

When
a
new
courthouse
was
built
in
Pendleton
for
the
Court
of
General
Sessions
and
Common
Pleas
,
the
importance
of
Pickensville
began
to
wane
.

The
ultimate
demise
came
when
the
railroad
located
through
Easley
,
a
scant
0
miles
away
.

The
state
granted
a
charter
for
Easley
in
January
,
0000
.

The
next
year
(
0000
)
,
the
US
Post
Office
Department
renamed
the
Pickensville
Post
Office
,
which
had
opened
in
0000
to
the
Easley
Post
Office
.

Both
Pickensville
and
the
county
of
Pickens
,
SC
were
named
after
General
Andrew
Pickens
of
Revolutionary
War
fame
.

Easley
's
namesake
was
General
William
King
Easley
who
fought
for
the
confederacy
during
the
Civil
War
.

Of
note
is
the
fact
that
General
Easley
was
an
attorney
for
the
Atlanta
and
Charlotte
Railroad
Company
,
which
owned
the
railroad
that
passed
through
Easley
.

Robert
Elliot
Holcombe
,
who
became
the
first
mayor
of
Easley
financed
and
built
the
first
depot
in
town
.

Liberty
is
a
city
in
Pickens
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

It
is
part
of
the
Greenville
–
Mauldin
–
Easley
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
city
was
chartered
on
March
0
,
0000
.

Origins
How
exactly
Liberty
got
its
name
has
been
a
source
of
debate
over
the
years
.

There
are
no
real
historical
accounts
of
why
Liberty
was
given
the
name
it
was
.

The
most
popular
—
though
probably
mythical
—
story
regarding
the
reason
the
area
was
named
Liberty
was
put
forth
by
Mrs.
Annie
Craig
in
0000
:
“
At
the
close
of
the
Revolutionary
war
a
religious
meeting
was
being
held
at
a
church
close
to
a
spring
near
the
present
town
of
Liberty
when
the
word
came
that
Cornwallis
had
surrendered
and
the
colonies
had
gained
their
independence
.

This
church
was
named
Liberty
and
it
and
the
spring
were
located
just
beyond
where
the
cemetery
is
now
located
,
hence
the
name
Liberty
.

”
Some
have
claimed
that
Liberty
was
once
named
Salubrity
Springs
,
but
was
renamed
Liberty
in
the
late
00th
century
.

References
to
early
land
records
,
however
,
suggests
that
such
is
not
the
case
.

While
there
are
many
records
that
refer
to
the
area
as
Liberty
Spring
,
there
are
no
private
or
legal
documents
that
contain
a
reference
to
Salubrity
Spring
.

The
first
reference
to
Salubrity
comes
from
the
name
of
a
farm
purchased
by
Mr.
Allen
Fuller
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Mr.
Fuller
set
up
a
post
office
in
his
home
,
naming
it
Salubrity
Post
Office
.

This
post
office
remained
in
operation
until
February
,
0000
,
three
years
after
the
first
official
Liberty
post
office
was
established
in
0000
.

Once
the
town
of
Liberty
was
chartered
little
more
than
a
month
after
the
Salubrity
post
office
closed
,
the
name
Salubrity
became
little
more
than
a
memory
.

History
Early
History
(
to
0000
)
Liberty
today
sits
on
land
that
was
once
part
of
the
Cherokee
Indians
’
hunting
ground
.

The
Otarre
,
or
Lower
Hill
Cherokees
,
had
several
thriving
villages
along
the
riverbanks
in
the
area
;
perhaps
the
most
notable
example
being
the
village
of
Keowee
,
located
near
the
modern
day
Oconee
and
Pickens
County
line
.

Cherokee
tribesmen
,
who
often
survived
by
growing
crops
,
and
tended
to
live
in
small
villages
,
were
in
many
ways
more
domesticated
than
other
Native
American
tribes
.

The
Cherokee
also
hunted
game
,
believing
that
the
foothills
were
a
sacred
hunting
ground
for
deer
,
buffalo
,
and
other
large
animals
.

Tradition
holds
that
Hernando
DeSoto
and
his
group
of
Spanish
explorers
were
the
first
Europeans
to
travel
through
the
area
around
year
0000
.

The
first
Englishmen
to
venture
into
the
area
were
traders
who
often
travelled
up
from
Charles
Town
and
Savannah
to
exchange
their
guns
,
horses
,
cloth
,
and
liquor
with
the
Cherokee
for
animal
skin
and
fur
.

In
0000
,
British
colonists
built
Fort
Prince
George
,
the
first
white
settlement
in
Pickens
County
.

During
the
American
Revolution
the
Cherokee
chose
to
support
the
loyalists
.

South
Carolinian
patriots
,
angered
at
the
Cherokee
for
supporting
the
Redcoats
,
forced
them
to
cede
much
of
their
territory
with
the
Treaty
of
DeWitt
’s
Corner
in
0000
.

American
settlers
did
not
start
moving
into
the
area
in
large
numbers
until
the
mid-0000s
.

Much
of
the
history
of
the
Liberty
area
in
the
late
00th
century
is
unknown
.

By
0000
,
Liberty
—
then
called
Liberty
Spring
—
was
included
in
the
newly
formed
Pendleton
District
,
which
included
most
of
modern-day
Anderson
,
Oconee
,
and
Pickens
Counties
.

During
the
Antebellum
period
,
most
people
living
in
Liberty
Spring
were
subsistence
farmers
:
farmers
who
grew
only
what
they
needed
to
survive
.

Few
in
the
area
could
afford
to
own
slaves
like
the
wealthier
planters
in
the
Lowcountry
,
and
almost
every
farmer
was
forced
to
work
the
land
himself
.

Even
for
those
who
wished
to
trade
with
other
towns
,
the
poor
roads
made
the
effort
to
transport
goods
cost
more
than
those
goods
were
often
worth
.

Outside
of
church
,
local
residents
had
few
opportunities
to
socialize
with
each
other
.

By
0000
,
the
Pendleton
District
had
split
up
into
Pickens
and
Anderson
Districts
,
with
Liberty
becoming
part
of
the
new
Pickens
District
,
which
included
both
Pickens
and
Oconee
Counties
.

In
0000
,
a
group
of
Pickens
County
delegates
went
to
Columbia
,
where
they
—
along
with
every
other
South
Carolina
delegate
—
voted
unanimously
in
favor
of
South
Carolina
’s
secession
from
the
Union
.

Though
it
is
generally
accepted
that
the
first
shot
of
the
Civil
War
occurred
when
the
Union
ship
Star
of
the
West
was
fired
upon
from
state
troops
at
Morris
Island
on
January
0
,
0000
,
an
old
legend
claims
that
a
local
resident
named
William
Mauldin
fired
upon
the
Union
ship
from
Fort
Moultrie
a
few
hours
earlier
,
making
his
the
first
shot
of
the
War
.

Either
way
,
what
is
known
is
that
men
from
almost
every
family
in
the
area
enlisted
to
fight
for
the
Confederate
cause
.

Many
families
lost
two
,
three
,
or
more
sons
to
the
war
effort
.

Several
companies
of
infantry
and
cavalry
were
formed
in
Pickens
District
before
being
dispatched
to
serve
under
one
of
the
state
regiments
.

The
men
who
either
refused
to
enlist
or
deserted
in
battle
were
often
thought
upon
with
scorn
by
their
neighbors
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
,
and
even
their
descendents
were
often
ostracized
for
years
afterwards
.

The
women
who
stayed
behind
willingly
suffered
through
the
whole
war
by
doing
without
foods
and
supplies
that
were
needed
in
the
war
effort
.

After
the
war
,
Pickens
District
,
like
the
rest
of
the
South
,
was
placed
under
martial
law
by
Union
troops
.

With
little
choice
in
the
matter
,
South
Carolina
was
readmitted
to
the
Union
in
0000
.

Not
long
afterwards
,
Pickens
District
was
separated
into
the
modern
day
Pickens
and
Oconee
Counties
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
southerners
had
little
control
over
their
government
.

Gangs
of
Union
troops
sacked
and
looted
many
farms
in
Pickens
County
during
this
period
,
known
as
Reconstruction
,
and
the
county
and
state
governments
were
largely
controlled
by
Northerners
who
moved
South
after
the
war
.

Reconstruction
officially
ended
in
South
Carolina
around
year
0000
,
not
long
after
former
Confederate
General
Wade
Hampton
III
was
elected
governor
under
the
Democratic
ticket
.

The
Founders
’
Era
(
0000-0000
)
Liberty
’s
official
recognition
as
a
town
came
soon
after
the
Charlotte-Atlanta
Airline
Railway
was
completed
in
the
early
0000s
.

Former
Confederate
General
William
Easley
,
a
lawyer
working
for
the
railroad
company
,
negotiated
to
have
the
tracks
laid
through
the
southern
part
of
Pickens
County
.

It
is
along
these
tracks
that
the
towns
of
Liberty
,
Easley
,
and
Central
all
grew
.

By
0000
,
Liberty
Station
was
built
north
of
Liberty
Spring
after
Mrs.
Catherine
Templeton
deeded
her
land
to
the
railroad
company
.

John
T.
Boggs
set
up
the
new
Liberty
Post
Office
that
same
year
,
and
was
named
the
town
’s
first
postmaster
.

Liberty
was
formally
chartered
on
March
0
,
0000
,
with
the
future
town
center
being
located
on
the
former
lands
of
Mrs.
Templeton
.

In
0000
,
James
Avenger
was
appointed
the
town
’s
first
marshall
.

The
marshall
,
a
forerunner
to
today
’s
chief
of
police
,
was
satired
in
a
Pickens
Sentinel
article
that
claimed
,
“
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
,
except
to
look
after
the
cows
that
go
astray
.

”
The
town
’s
first
mayor
W.E.
Holcombe
,
a
lawyer
and
former
state
senator
,
was
elected
in
0000
.

He
,
like
every
succeeding
mayor
until
the
early
00th
century
,
conducted
most
municipal
business
in
his
own
home
.

Several
schools
were
already
in
operation
by
this
time
,
with
most
being
privately
funded
,
and
sponsored
either
by
the
community
or
by
the
local
churches
.

The
Liberty
First
Baptist
Church
had
existed
prior
to
the
city
’s
founding
,
being
located
at
the
old
Liberty
Spring
site
.

Reports
indicate
the
Church
had
a
congregation
as
early
as
year
0000
,
when
they
met
at
an
old
log
house
north
of
the
present-day
town
.

The
Liberty
Presbyterian
Church
was
built
in
0000
at
its
present
site
;
formerly
the
church
’s
members
had
worshiped
at
Mt.
Carmel
Church
in
the
country
.

The
Textile
Era
(
0000-0000
)
Liberty
’s
next
change
came
in
0000
,
when
Mr.
Jeptha
P.
Smith
organized
and
started
the
first
cotton
mill
,
which
he
named
the
Liberty
Mill
.

The
original
mill
contained
a
card
room
and
operating
spinning
frame
.

Eighteen
houses
and
two
overseer
houses
were
built
as
a
mill
village
to
house
the
plant
’s
workers
and
their
families
.

The
second
cotton
mill
was
built
by
Mr.
Lang
Clayton
of
Norris
in
0000
.

Built
in
a
part
of
town
often
referred
to
as
Rabbit
Town
,
the
plant
was
originally
named
the
Calumet
Mill
,
and
later
renamed
the
Maplecroft
Mill
.

By
0000
,
both
mills
had
come
under
the
control
of
Woodside
Mills
.

The
first
mill
became
known
as
Woodside
Liberty
Plant
#
0
(
commonly
called
the
Big
Mill
)
,
and
the
second
as
Woodside
Liberty
Plant
#
0
(
commonly
called
the
Little
Mill
)
.

Woodside
Mills
operated
the
plants
until
0000
,
when
the
company
was
purchased
by
Dan
River
Mills
of
Virginia
.

At
their
height
in
the
0000s
,
the
mills
employed
over
one
thousand
workers
and
housed
over
one
thousand
looms
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
Woodside
Liberty
Mills
were
the
world
’s
largest
producers
of
oxford
fabric
,
a
popular
fabric
of
the
era
.

The
mills
were
again
purchased
in
the
early
0000s
by
Greenwood
Mills
,
which
maintained
control
of
the
mills
until
local
textile
industry
declined
in
the
0000s
due
largely
to
foreign
competition
.

The
growth
of
cotton
mills
in
the
area
brought
about
a
major
shift
in
the
way
people
lived
.

Many
migrated
away
from
farmlands
to
the
mill
villages
,
and
went
from
growing
food
to
survive
to
earning
hourly
wages
in
the
mills
.

Though
farming
was
a
hard
life
,
early
mill
life
was
grueling
in
its
own
right
;
mill
workers
—
condescendingly
referred
to
as
lintheads
—
often
worked
twelve
or
more
hours
a
day
in
unventilated
rooms
.

Nevertheless
,
most
workers
believed
that
they
were
fortunate
just
to
have
such
work
,
and
willingly
worked
in
the
same
mills
all
their
lives
.

In
many
mill
village
families
,
both
the
husband
and
wife
worked
in
the
same
mill
.

Outside
of
the
mills
,
several
other
major
changes
also
happened
during
this
long
time
period
.

Electricity
came
to
Liberty
in
0000
,
when
Mr.
J.
Warren
Smith
,
a
salesman
,
installed
two
gasoline
generators
downtown
to
operate
the
first
street
lights
and
the
lights
of
several
shops
.

By
0000
,
demand
had
increased
to
the
point
that
Mr.
Smith
decided
to
sell
his
assets
to
Duke
Power
,
which
established
a
small
office
downtown
.

The
Liberty
Fire
Department
was
first
established
in
0000
,
with
J.
Warren
Smith
—
the
same
man
who
brought
electricity
to
Liberty
—
being
named
as
the
first
fire
chief
.

The
Fire
Department
moved
into
its
present
building
in
0000
.

The
first
town
library
originated
in
0000
as
a
small
room
located
in
the
same
building
as
City
Hall
.

The
Sarlin
Community
Library
,
the
one
in
current
use
,
was
built
at
its
present
location
in
0000
.

Liberty
’s
police
department
was
finally
organized
in
the
0000s
,
when
the
city
employed
a
chief
of
police
and
two
policemen
.

The
first
telephone
service
came
to
Liberty
in
0000
,
when
Southern
Bell
installed
a
telephone
switchboard
in
the
same
building
as
the
post
office
.

The
first
water
plant
for
the
town
was
built
in
0000
on
Black
Snake
Road
.

This
plant
initially
supplied
water
to
around
one
hundred
homes
.

This
plant
was
phased
out
by
0000
after
a
newer
waterworks
sight
was
built
on
Eighteen
Mile
Creek
.

The
former
Mohawk
Carpet
plant
is
currently
occupied
by
Southern
Vinyl
Windows
&
Doors
,
a
major
employer
in
the
area
.

History
Originally
called
New
Hope
.

In
0000
,
a
post
office
was
established
on
what
is
now
S.C.
Highway
000
.

A
tiny
settlement
sprung
up
around
it
,
and
both
the
post
office
and
community
were
named
New
Hope
.

In
0000
,
the

changed
its
name
to
Vernonville
or
Vernonsville
in
honor
of
local
physician

Vernon
.

In

would
provide
land
for

agree
to
rename
the
town
after
him

Mountains

History
The
first
homesteaders
began
settling
the
Landrum
area
around
0000
.

They
came
from
Pennsylvania
,
Maryland
and
Virginia
seeking
the
fertile
,
free
land
.

These
were
hardy
settlers
that
had
to
fight
not
only
the
elements
of
an
isolated
land
but
Native
Americans
as
well
.

To
defend
themselves
against
the
Native
Americans
the
settlers
built
a
series
of
forts
located
at
critical
points
.

One
,
Earle
's
Fort
,
was
located
approximately
0
miles
east
of
the
current
city
of
Landrum
.

From
around
the
0000s
the
location
was
known
as
Earlesville
(
referring
to
the
Earle
Family
)
.

The
first
postmaster
was
an
Earle
.

For
the
next
00
years
the
area
continued
to
grow
as
lumber
mills
and
corn
mills
were
established
.

The
roads
serving
the
area
were
poor
,
and
travel
was
difficult
even
in
the
best
weather
.

When
the
railroad
reached
Spartanburg
in
the
late
0000s
,
a
market
was
established
for
the
agricultural
products
of
the
area
.

It
was
n't
until
0000
,
after
the
railroad
was
extended
from
Spartanburg
,
that
the
Town
of
Landrum
was
officially
founded
.

The
city
is
named
after
John
Landrum
,
who
gave
the
railroad
land
in
0000
for
the
construction
of
a
station
.

The
first
name
for
the
town
was
Landrum
's
Station
,
but
the
name
was
shortened
to
Landrum
around
0000
.

As
the
railroad
pushed
further
north
into
North
Carolina
,
the
city
continued
to
grow
and
expand
.

In
0000
,
Landrum
was
incorporated
as
a
town
,
and
in
0000
it
was
made
a
city
.

The
early
citizens
of
the
area
were
farmers
and
raised
corn
and
harvested
timber
products
.

This
changed
to
cotton
in
the
early
0000s
,
and
around
0000
,
peach
es
became
the
region
's
main
cash
crop
.

The
first
industry
in
the
area
was
centered
on
textile
s
,
with
several
textile
companies
still
existing
today
.

Industry
has
diversified
over
the
past
forty
years
to
now
include
companies
producing
products
from
electronics
parts
to
furniture
hardware
.

It
is
part
of
a
00-county
region
of
northwestern
South
Carolina
known
as
"
The
Upstate
,
"
and
is
located
northwest
of
Columbia
,
west
of
Charlotte
,
North
Carolina
,
and
about
northeast
of
Atlanta
,
Georgia
.

History
This
region
of
the
Carolina
Piedmont
was
for
centuries
a
cherished
hunting
ground
of
the
Catawba
and
Cherokee
tribes
,
which
occupied
land
east
and
west
of
this
area
,
respectively
.

This
distant
heritage
can
be
glimpsed
in
some
of
the
natural
features
.

Early
European
settlers
to
this
area
included
French
fur
trappers
,
English
woodsmen
,
and
Scots-Irish
farmers
.

Few
remnants
survive
from
these
early
pioneering
days
,
but
traces
can
be
found
in
the
more
rural
areas
of
the
county
.

First
established
in
the
0000s
as
a
courthouse
village
,
Spartanburg
may
have
been
named
for
the
Spartan
regiment
of
the
South
Carolina
militia
.

The
city
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
at
the
time
of
the
00th
anniversary
of
the
Battle
of
Cowpens
,
a
pivotal
fight
of
the
American
Revolution
that
took
place
only
a
few
miles
away
.

The
city
’s
streets
and
architectural
record
reflect
the
changes
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
.

Cotton
mill
s
have
abounded
in
the
Spartanburg
area
since
0000
,
earning
Spartanburg
the
reputation
as
the
"
Lowell
of
the
South
.
"

Although
there
were
relatively
few
mills
in
the
area
before
the
Civil
War
,
new
technological
advances
that
simplified
the
work
,
northern
capital
,
and
out-migration
from
the
poor
farms
created
a
wave
of
postbellum
mill
development
here
and
in
much
of
the
Piedmont
South
.

Additionally
,
the
abundant
streams
and
rivers
in
the
area
are
just
beginning
their
descent
towards
the
lower-lying
Midlands
region
.

In
many
places
,
these
waterways
descend
abruptly
,
providing
a
source
for
plentiful
waterpower
.

Cotton
mills
were
built
along
these
rivers
to
harness
this
power
,
and
so
began
the
region
’s
servitude
to
King
Cotton
.

These
mills
,
their
owners
and
their
laborers
dominated
the
politics
and
economy
of
the
region
for
nearly
a
century
.

Although
nearly
all
abandoned
,
many
mills
remain
along
the
riverbanks
,
the
Piedmont
equivalent
of
Gothic
ruins
.

When
the
United
States
entered
World
War
I
in
0000
,
one
of
the
sixteen
divisional
cantonments
for
the
training
of
National
Guard
troops
was
Camp
Wadsworth
,
which
is
located
in
the
vicinity
of
Westgate
Mall
.

Large
numbers
of
New
York
National
Guardsmen
trained
there
in
addition
to
many
southern
troops
.

During
World
War
II
,
Camp
Croft
south
of
the
city
trained
Army
recruits
.

This
is
now
a
South
Carolina
state
park
with
the
same
name

Some
portions
of

park
contain
the
original
quonset
hut

History
The
earliest
history
of
this
area
begins
with
the
membership
of
the
Church
of
Christ
on
Jamey
's
Creek
dated
September
00
,
0000
.

The
church
was
named
for
Jamey
's
Creek
,
now
called
Jimmie
's
Creek
,
which
heads
off
McArthur
Street
behind
the
Woodruff
State
Branch
Bank
on
North
Main
Street
.

The
early
members
traveled
some
distance
to
attend
this
church
.

They
were
from
the
communities
of
Cavins
,
Enoree
,
Crescent
,
Switzer
and
even
others
in
Laurens
County
.

Most
of
the
early
settlers
had
come
from
Virginia
and
North
Carolina
.

They
were
primarily
veterans
of
the
Revolution
and
their
families
.

Joseph
Woodruff
received
a
grant
of
,
which
would
later
become
the
site
of
the
city
of
Woodruff
.

He
came
to
this
area
from
the
Yadkin
River
valley
in
North
Carolina
after
his
service
in
the
Revolution
.

The
first
census
of
Spartanburg
District
,
in
0000
,
shows
who
his
neighbors
were
.

All
of
these
people
were
farmers
.

There
were
a
few
country
stores
in
those
days
,
and
these
were
supplied
by
"
Wagoner
's
"
.

One
of
Joseph
Woodruff
's
sons
,
Thomas
,
remained
in
the
area
and
dreamed
of
founding
a
town
,
but
he
did
not
live
to
see
Woodruff
incorporated
.

His
two
sons
,
Dr.
Charles
Pinckney
Woodruff
and
Captain
A.
B.
Woodruff
,
were
most
instrumental
in
carrying
out
their
father
's
wishes
.

Therefore
,
the
town
was
named
in
Thomas
Woodruff
's
honor
.

There
was
no
town
nor
industry
until
after
the
town
was
chartered
in
0000
.

Men
from
the
rural
areas
came
into
Woodruff
to
establish
businesses
and
the
town
began
to
grow
.

The
two
Woodruff
brothers
worked
vigorously
to
get
the
railroad
to
run
through
the
town
.

The
railroad
was
completed
in
0000
.

This
caused
a
rapid
growth
of
business
.

The
oldest
standing
home
in
Woodruff
today
is
located
on
Main
Street
.

The
house
was
built
in
the
0000s
by
Harrison
Patillo
Woodruff
,
son
of
Thomas
.
"

Squire
Jim
"
Westmoreland
bought
his
home

he
came

Woodruff
to
establish

mercantile
business
