area
was
still
part
of
Lancaster
County
.

Named
for

boundaries
remain
unchanged
to
this
day
.

York
County

,
and
for

Casino
proposal
During
0000
there
was
debate
about
the
proposed
construction
of
a
casino
in
Straban
Township
near
the
intersection
of
U.S.
Route
00
and
U.S.
Route
00
,
not
far
from
the
East
Cavalry
Field
battle
site
.

Legislation
enacted
in
0000
known
as
"
Act
00
"
permitted
up
to
00,000
slot
machines
to
be
located
in
casinos
throughout
the
state
in
an
effort
to
offset
high
property
taxes
.

One
of
two
available
casino
licenses
was
pursued
by
Chance
Enterprises
Inc.
and
Millennium
Management
Group
for
their
proposed
"
Crossroads
Gaming
Resort
&
Spa
"
.

Many
of
the
residents
of
Gettysburg
(
the
closest
incoprorated
city/town/borough
)
and
tourists
believed
that
a
casino
near
Gettysburg
and
the
resulting
increase
in
traffic
would
have
had
a
negative
impact
on
Gettysburg
's
hallowed
ground
.

A
group
called
"
No
Casino
Gettysburg
,
"
made
up
of
local
citizens
as
well
as
students
and
faculty
of
Gettysburg
College
,
was
formed
to
lobby
against
the
proposal
.

On
April
0
,
0000
,
the
Gettysburg
borough
council
voted
by
0
–
0
to
support
the
proposal
.

The
Pennsylvania
Gaming
Control
Board
(
PGCB
)
began
hearings
on
the
proposal
on
April
0
,
0000
,
at
Gettysburg
College
.

A
second
hearing
was
held
on
April
0
,
0000
in
Harrisburg
and
a
third
and
final
hearing
occurred
on
May
00
,
0000
at

.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
board
announced
that
it
intended
to
reach
a
final
decision
on
the
casino
proposal
by
December
00
,
0000
.

[

]
On
that
date
,
the
PGCB
opted
not
to
award
Crossroads
a
casino
license
,
effectively
killing
the
proposal
.

Crossroads
'
president
soon
announced
that
he
will
not
appeal
the
decision
(

In

York
Springs
is
a
borough
in
Adams
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

York
Springs
is
served
by
the
Bermudian
Springs
School
District
.

History
York
Sulphur
Springs
,
the
first
summer
resort
in
Adams
County
,
was
patronized
by
persons
from
Philadelphia
and
Baltimore
who
came
to
the
resort
by
stage
coach
.

The
resort
was
built
on
a
tract
of
land
owned
by
the
Wiermans
.

When
first
settlements
were
made
,
the
original
building
conformed
to
the
plan
of
too
many
of
the
older
taverns
and
housed
only
fifty
guests
.

The
later
building
was
erected
partly
on
the
old
foundation
about
0000
.

A
cross
wing
or
section
in
the
rear
made
a
perfect
T
formation
.

A
colonnade
extended
along
both
sides
of
the
main
building
,
forming
delightful
balconies
.

The
hotel
was
beautiful
,
most
attractive
and
symmetrical
.

The
lawns
,
walks
,
rustic
bridges
and
arbors
were
kept
in
perfect
condition
.

Not
only
the
lawns
but
the
nearby
woods
were
swept
with
brooms
.

Arnold
Gardner
and
Charles
Kettlewell
first
leased
and
later
bought
York
Sulphur
Springs
from
the
heirs
of
Robert
Oliver
,
and
it
was
during
their
nine
years
of
ownership
that
the
place
reached
the
height
of
its
popularity
.

000
guests
could
be
accommodated
,
but
at
times
the
hotel
was
so
crowded
that
rooms
had
to
be
secured
at
nearby
farm
houses
for
guests
.

From
records
of
the
Hamilton
and
Dill
families
,
we
find
that
General
George
Washington
and
his
wife
Martha
did
spend
some
time
at
the
Springs
during
the
summer
of
0000
when
John
Hamilton
was
proprietor
of
the
place
.

This
was
the
last
summer
of
the
old
General
's
life
as
he
died
the
following
winter
.

Bowling
,
croquet
playing
,
dancing
,
and
drinking
from
the
famous
spring
were
the
amusements
for
the
guests
.

The
water
was
very
unpalatable
but
highly
medicinal
in
value
.

An
analysis
showed
that
it
contained
00
parts
Epsom
salts
,
0
parts
gypsum
,
0
parts
common
salt
,
and
the
balance
sulphur
.

This
sulphur
vein
extends
as
far
as
Wierman
's
Mill
and
is
especially
noticeable
in
very
warm
weather
.

The
first
balloon
ascension
in
Adams
County
was
made
from
York
Sulphur
Springs
for
the
entertainment
of
its
many
guests
.

The
main
building
survived
the
others
for
some
years
but
was
finally
destroyed
by
fire
January
0
,
0000
.

Donald
Miller
's
stone
bungalow
is
built
on
the
exact
site
of
the
old
hotel
so
famous
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
.

After
railroads
were
built
,
the
Springs
'
popularity
decreased
rapidly
,
and
finally
the
numerous
buildings
that
made
up
the
site
fell
into
decay
and
gradually
disappeared
.

Although
the
information
for
York
Sulphur
Springs
exists
within
what
is
considered
the
boundaries
of
York
Springs
,
the
existing
information
now
encompasses
Latimore
Township
.

In
the
last
decade
there
has
been
a
large
increase
in
the
Hispanic
population
,
with
workers
from
Mexico
coming
to
the
area
to
work
in
the
local
apple
orchards

History
In

mid-0000s
,
the
area
which
is
now
Aspinwall
was
primarily
owned
by
the
descendants
of
James
Ross
,
but
as
the
steel
industry
was
thriving
in
Pittsburgh
,
Henry
Warner
,
superintendent
of
the
Allegheny
County
Workhouse
,
had
the
idea
of
creating
a
residential
community
along
the
bank
of
a
river
.

Warner
traveled
to
New
York
to
discuss
the
idea
with
Mrs.
Annie
Aspinwall
.

He
purchased
of
land
from
her
and
formed
the
Aspinwall
Land
Company
in

History
The
area
that
would
become
Baldwin
Township
was
originally
settled
around
0000
.

The
Allegheny
County
Court
of
Quarter
Sessions
established
Baldwin
Township
on
February
00
,
0000
,
from
Upper
St.
Clair
,
Lower
St.
Clair
,
Jefferson
,
and
Mifflin
townships
.

The
area
was
named
for
Henry
Baldwin
,
a
Pittsburgh
lawyer
who
served
as
an
Associate
Justice
of
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
from
0000
until
his
death
in
0000
.

Baldwin
Township
was
originally
00,000
acres
(
00
km
²
)
and
consisted
of
the
present-day
Pittsburgh
neighborhoods
of
Carrick
,
Hays
,
Brookline
,
and
Overbrook
,
along
with
the
present-day
municipalities
of
Brentwood
,
Whitehall
,
Castle
Shannon
,
and
Baldwin
Borough
.

The
coal
seam
lying
underneath
Baldwin
Township
made
mining
the
township
's
largest
industry
.

The
township
was
also
home
to
the
first
glass
factories
in
Allegheny
County
.

Agriculture
was
an
important
part
of
Baldwin
Township
's
economy
from
0000
to
0000
.

Its
most
well-known
agricultural
exports
were
cherries
and
whiskey
(
many
citizens
of
Baldwin
Township
were
part
of
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
)
.

The
township
continued
to
thrive
until
the
late
00th
century
,
when
its
size
became
too
cumbersome
to
handle
.

Due
to
the
lack
of
maintenance
throughout
the
township
's
roads
,
residents
of
many
areas
broke
off
to
form
their
own
municipalities
.

In
0000
,
000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
became
the
Pittsburgh
neighborhood
of
Hays
.

Three
years
later
in
0000
,
Carrick
and
Brookline
became
Pittsburgh
wards
,
taking
with
them
0,000
acres
(
0
km
²
)
and
000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
,
respectively
.

From
0000
-
0000
,
approximately
0,000
acres
(
00
km
²
)
of
the
original
Baldwin
Township
broke
off
to
become
the
municipalities
of
Brentwood
,
Castle
Shannon
,
Mt.
Lebanon
,
Whitehall
,
and
Baldwin
Borough
.

The
City
of
Pittsburgh
annexed
an
additional
area
of
land
that
is
now
the
city
's
Overbrook
neighborhood
.

Today
,
only
000
of
the
township
's
original
00,000
acres
(
00
km
²
)
remain
.

Historians
calculate
that
if
Baldwin
Township
had
never
been
divided
,
it

History
Ben
Avon
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
January
0000
,
from
Kilbuck
Township
.

Like
many
early
suburbs
,
Ben
Avon
was
originally
linked
to
Pittsburgh
by
train
.

One
of
the
first
homes
in
the
area
,
the
Arthur-Johnson
House
,
was
built
at
a
bend
in
the
Ohio
River
above
the
Pittsburgh
and
Fort
Wayne
Railroad
,
a
route
that
was
known
to
George
Washington
.

The
house
was
built
by
a
merchant
from
Allegheny
City
looking
for
a
summer
retreat
from
the
steel
industry
.

To
make
the
commute
from
Pittsburgh
easier
,
a
commuter
railroad
was
built
.

Laurel
Run
station
was
located
by
the
Arthur-Johnson
House
.

The
new
railroad
made
Ben
Avon
and
bordering
Avalon
a
desirable
place
for
wealthy
merchants
and
executives
to
live
.

Ben
Avon
had
its
own
newspaper
,
the
Ben
Avon
Forum
,
which
,
in
July
0000
,
wrote
,
"
Ben
Avon
is
the
most
desirable
community
to
live
in
the
entire
Allegheny
County
-
and
if
pressed
,
we
might
take
an
even
larger
territory
.

In
0000
,
plans
were
underway
to
build
the

and
Ohio
River
Boulevard
(

River

History
Prior
to
0000
,
the
land
that
became
Ben
Avon
Heights
was
farmland
belonging
to
Samuel
Taylor
and
John
Wilson
.

In
0000
Walter
Pringle
Fraser
of
Ben
Avon
bought
on
the
former
Taylor
farm
,
using
forty
of
the
acres
to
build
the
Ben
Avon
Country
Club
and
golf
course
.

The
remaining
were
opened
for
a
residential
development
which
he
named
Ben
Avon
Heights
.

Like

Avon
,
Ben
Avon
Heights
appealed
to
Pittsburghers
looking
for
rural
summer
homes
away
from

city
.

The

0000
.

When

Ben
Avon
Country
Club

housing
.

The

commercial
property
in
Ben
Avon
Heights
,
opened
in
0000
with
its
clubhouse
in
Ben
Avon
Heights
and
golf
course
in
neighboring
Kilbuck
Township
.

In

early
0000s
,
John
I.
Thompson
purchased
a
portion
of
the
original
John
Wilson
Farm
in
Kilbuck
Township
and
transformed
the
farmland
into
another
residential
area
known
as
the
Thompson
Plan
.

The

annexed
the
Thompson
Plan
in

boundaries
of
Ben
Avon
Heights
to
the
way
they

and
is
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Metro
Area
,
approximately
0

southwest
of
Pittsburgh
.

The
population
was

census
.

Geography
Bethel
Park
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
affluent
borough
had
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

Its
average
elevation
is
above
sea
level
.

Bethel
Park
lies
at
the
margin
between
the
Pittsburgh
Low
Plateau
and
Waynesburg
Hills
Sections
of
the
Allegheny
Plateau
physiographic
province
.

The
area
is
characterized
as
a
maturely
dissected
region
where
the
ephemeral
minor
tributaries
converge
into
the
tributaries
of
principal
streams
.

The
highest
point
in
Bethel
Park
is
Rocky
Ridge
,
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
municipality
,
,
and
the
lowest
point
is
at
the
intersection
of
the
Piney
Fork
and
Alsip
Run
creeks
,
,
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
municipality
.

Geology
The
exposed
rocks
in
the
municipality
are
mostly
composed
of
sandstone
,
limestone
,
shale
,
and
a
few
coal
layers
(
Redstone
,
Waynesburg
,
Washington
,
etc.
)
.

The
ages
of
the
exposed
rocks
bracket
the
late
Pennsylvanian
epoch
(
Gzhelian
age
;
approximately
000
million
years
ago
)
near
the
lowest
elevations
,
and
early
Permian
period
(
Asselian
age
;
approximaetely
000
million
years
ago
)
near
the
highest
parts
of
the
southern
part
of
Bethel
Park
(
e.g.
Rocky
Ridge
)
.

These
sedimentary
rocks
were
deposited
as
the
sea
level
rose
and
fell
along
an
ancient
coastline
(
with
the
region
alternating
between
delta
,
shallow
lake
,
and
shallow
sea
)
,
and
finally
being
uplifted
with
the
formation
of
the
Appalachian
Mountains
.

Bethel
Park
is
underlain
by
the
Pennsylvania-age
Monongahela
Formation
.

The
Monongahela
Formation
consists
of
the
Uniontown
member
and
the
underlying
Pittsburgh
member
,
and
the
base
is
the
Pittsburgh
coal
seam
.

Much
of
southern
Allegheny
County
is
undermined
,
and
the
PADEP
indicates
that
all
of
Bethel
Park
was
undermined
.

A
portion
of
the
area
is
underlain
by
the
Pittsburgh
Terminal
No.
0
Mine
(
Cortis
and
others
,
0000
)
,
which
was
commonly
known
as
the
"
H
"
Mine
and
the
Coverdale
Mine
.

The
mine
opened
around
0000
.

The
historic
operations
of
the
Coverdale
Mine
are
apparent
on
a
Bridgeville
0.0-minute
topographic
map
.

A
“
Mine
Dump
”
is
shown
adjacent
to
the
Montour
Railroad
tracks
and
South
Park
Road
.

Coal
was
mined
through
vertical
shafts
accessing
inclined
slopes
following
the
dip
of
the
Pittsburgh
coal
seam
.

Mine
voids
in
the
inclined
slope
resulted
from
the
practice
of
room
and
pillar
mining
during
the
early
00th
century
.

The
Coverdale
Mine
is
closed
and
largely
unflooded
.

Government
The
residents
of
Bethel
Park
elected
a
Home
Rule
form
of
Government
in
0000
,
which
resulted
in
Bethel
Borough
being
renamed
as
the
Municipality
of
Bethel
Park
.

This
Home
Rule
form
of
government
provides
the
Municipality
with
greater
powers
of
governance
than
the
former
Borough
form
of
government
.

The
municipality
is
divided
into
0
"
wards
"
,
each
with
one
elected
member
of
the
Bethel
Park
Municipal
Council
,
representing
each
.

Nine
members
of
Council
and
a
Mayor
govern
the
Municipality
of
Bethel
Park
.

Each
of
the
nine
members
of
Council
are
elected
by
Ward
and
the
Mayor
is
elected
at
large
;
all
serve
four-year
terms
.

The
population
of
the
Municipality
is
evenly
divided
into
the
nine
wards
and
each
Council
member
is
required
to
maintain
residency
in

and
0000s
.

This

two
woes
nearly
destroyed
the

indigenous
people
to

watch
for
their
enemies
.

,
was
the

.

The

area
of

,
first
settled
as

was
part
of
Wilkins
Township
until

,
when

was
incorporated
.

On

,
0000
,
after
Braddock
Township
had
already
been
broken
up
into
the
boroughs
of
Swissvale
,
North
Braddock
,
and
Rankin
,
the
remaining
area
incorporated
itself
as
Braddock
Hills
.

Braddock
Hills
experienced
a
housing
boom
following
World
War
II
.

Many
GI
's
used
their
VA
loans
to
acquire
newly
built
homes
.

Most
of
the
new
homes
were
built
on
Illinois
Ave
,
Park
Ave
,
Columbia
Ave
,
Circle
,
McKelvey
Ave
,
and
Kings
Ave.
These
homes
were
generally
small
brick
Cape
Cods
,
colonials
,
or
brick
ranches
.

While
much
of
the
borough
has
new
housing
,
there
are
many
older
structures
.

Miners
built
shotgun-style
homes
.

Many
of
these
homes
were
located
on
Indiana
Avenue
.

Some
are
still
in
use
.

Many
older
residents
can
recall
when
the
Braddock
Hills
Shopping
Center
on
Yost
Boulevard
was
the
location
of
a
drive-in
movie
theater
.

The
Ardmore
Drive-In
operated
from
0000
to
0000
;
it
was
then
torn
down
and
was
replaced
with
a
shopping
center
that
included
a
Dollar
Bank
,
Gold
Circle
Department
Store
,
Giant
Eagle
,
Rite
Aid
,
and
several
small
shops
and
restaurants
.

Gold
Circle
would
later
close
and
was
replaced
with
a
Builder
's
Square
that
has
also
closed
.

This
part
of
the
shopping
center
is
currently
closed
although
there
have
been
plans
for
the
space
.

During
the
0000s
the
shopping
center
's
parking
lot
hosted
a
Sunday
flea
market
and
the
Braddock
Hills
Days
Festival
.

Other
long
gone
businesses
include
Azinger
's
(
corner
store
with
lunch
meat
,
milk
,
bread
,
and
candy
)
,
Gigante
's
(
Italian
grocery
store
)
,
Stop
and
Go
's
,
the
gas
station
on
the
corner
of
Brinton
and
Wilkins
Avenue
,
and
the
infamous
Hank
's
ConCan
(
bar
located
on
Wilkins
Avenue
)
.

Like
many
Western
Pennsylvania
communities
,
Braddock
Hills
was
a
coal
town
.

There
are
many
abandoned
coal
mine
s
located
throughout
the
town
.

This
has
resulted
in
sinkhole
s
in
an
area
that
has
been
called
the
"
coal
fields
"
.

The
coal
fields
are
located
in
the
center
of
the
community
.

It
is
a
wooded
area
that
is
home
to
deer
,
raccoons
,
opossums
,
squirrels
,
and
many
types
of
wild
birds
.

At
one
time
,
there
were
several
"
paths
"
or
foot
trails
that
criss-crossed
the
borough
.

During
the
0000s
,
the
center
of
the
coal
fields
had
a
sports
field
that
was
accessible
by
a
dirt
road
.

Local
softball
and
baseball
teams
would
play
among
the
trees
.

Another
prominent
historical
feature
of
the
borough
is
the
Braddock
Catholic
Cemetery
.

It
served
as
the
burying
ground
for
many
mill
workers
in
the
surrounding
communities
.

Braddock
Hills
was
the
home
of
Leonard
A.
Funk
,
a
Medal
of
Honor
recipient
.

A
monument
dedicated
to
his
exemplary
service
is
located
on
Brinton
Road
in
front
of
the
senior
citizens
'
building
.

Park
Avenue
is
the
longest
street
in
this
community
.

Education
The
area
along
Brinton
Road
,
Hannatown
,
had
its
own
one-room
schoolhouse
,
which
eventually
became
a
small
brick
elementary
school
known
as
Braddock
Hills
Elementary
,
on
land
donated
by
the
Hanna
family
,
that
grew
until
0000
,
when
a
court
mandate
combined
the
educational
system
of
Braddock
Hills
with
that
of
the
neighboring
borough
of
Swissvale
.

Braddock
Hills
Elementary
closed
its
doors
in
0000
.

It
would
soon
be
converted
into
a
community
center
that
would
house
the
police
department
and
a
daycare
center
.

In
0000
,
the
Swissvale
Area
School
District
combined
,
after
court
ordered
desegregation
,
even
further
to
form
the

,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United

Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

The
borough
is
located
in
the
Allegheny
Plateau
region
of
the
United
States
,
and
is
situated
south
of
the
confluence
of
the
Allegheny
River
and
the
Monongahela
River
to
form
the
Ohio
River
.

Due
to
its
position
between
the
Great
Lakes
and
the
windward
side
of
the
Allegheny
Mountains
,
Brentwood
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
region
,
receives
plentiful
precipitation
which
supports
lush
vegetation
.

Also
,
because

,
it
is
often
cloudy
,
having

cloudy
days
per

cloudy
days
.

In

winter
,
when

flow
establishes
itself
over
the
Great
Lakes
,
the
wind
blows
from
Lake
Erie
across
eastern
Ohio
and
western
Pennsylvania
.

That
wind
carries
moist
air
from
the
lake
,
producing
clouds
and
heavy
snow
squalls
.

Education
The
Court
of
Common
Pleas
appointed
Brentwood
's
first
school
board
who
took
charge
of
school
business
in
July
0000
,
and
the
first
group
of
teachers
were
hired
that
same
year
in
September
.

Brentwood
’s
first
school
was
Moore
Elementary
School
,
then
only
a
four-room
school
house
,
which
is
still
in
use
by
children
and
teachers
.

Because
Moore
School
was
not
sufficient
in
size
for
all
the
students
in
the
Borough
,
Elroy
School
was
built
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile
away
toward
Pittsburgh
,
and
renovations
were
completed
in
0000
to
both
schools
.

The
first
Brentwood
High
School
opened
in
the
basement
of
Elroy
School
in
September
0000
and
only
taught
through
ninth
grade
.

The
high
school
was
newly
built
in
0000
adjacent
to
the
current
Brentwood
Park
;
an
addition
was
constructed
in
0000
because
of
the
increase
in
population
,
and
once
again
in
0000
.

This
renovation
included
more
rooms
and
a
new
gymnasium
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
Pennsylvania
experienced
a
consolidation
of
school
districts
.

Some
wanted
the
Brentwood
school
district
to
be
folded
into
the
Baldwin-Whitehall
district
.

However
,
this
consolidation
was
never
realized
,
and
in
0000
a
new
four-story
building
containing
classrooms
and
an
indoor
pool
was
constructed
.

In
the
early
0000s
the
consensus
on
the
School
Board
was
to
close
Moore
and
Elroy
schools
and
consolidate
them
into
an
expanded
K-00th
grade
facility
at
the
existing
high
school
.

An
intense
community
debate
on
whether
to
close
Moore
and
Elroy
schools
ensued
with
the
supporters
of
preserving
and
rehabilitating
Moore
and
Elroy
prevailing
.

In
0000
,
the
Board
of
Directors
fully
modernized
and
remodeled
Elroy
School
and
Moore
School
received
two
new
additional
classrooms
.

The
district
also
built
a
new
academic
wing
to
the
front
of
the
0000
building
,
and
a
second
gymnasium
was
placed
on
the
demolished
third
and
fourth
floors
of
the
0000
addition
.

St.
Sylvester
School
was
established
in
September
0000
as
a
large
church
,
lunch
room
,
and
a
small
four-classroom
Catholic
elementary
school
.

St.
Sylvester
now
serves
as
Brentwood
's
parochial
elementary
school
,
teaching
children
from
preschool
to
0th
grade
.

Brownsville
Road
follows

Indian
trail
and
footpaths
connecting
Redstone
Old
Fort
with
the
"
forks
of
the
Ohio
"
,
a
distance
of

It
later
became
the
road
connecting
Pittsburgh
with
Brownsville
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
from
there
via
Nemacolin
's
Path
to
Virginia
and
points
further
east
.

It
was
a
major
route
for
travel
by
stagecoach
and
Conestoga
wagon
.

The
road
was
significant
during
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
,
particularly
its
southern
half
.

It
has
had
several
names
over
its
history
,
including
the
Red
Stone
Road
and
the
Brownsville
Plank
Road
,
or
Southern
Avenue
.

The
Point
View
Hotel
dates
back
to
0000
.

General
Andrew
Jackson
spent
a
night
there
before
he
entered
Pittsburgh
while
campaigning
for
the
presidency
.

General
Zachary
Taylor
stopped
for
a
night
as
well
.

President
James
Buchanan
and
Senator
Thaddeus
Stevens
stayed
on
two
occasions
.

Not
only
did
the
hotel
have
many
guests
who
were
quite
important
people
,
but
the
basement
of
the
hotel
was
a
stop
on
the
Underground
Railroad
during
the
0000s
.

The
hotel
was
then
turned
into
a
restaurant
and
bar
until
the
property
was
sold
and
demolished
in
November
0000
,
as
it
was
never
officially
recognized
as
a
historic
landmark
.

The
John
F.
Slater
Funeral
Home
,
formerly
the
White
Hall
Tavern
,
was
another
important
place
in
Brentwood
’s
history
.

In
the
earlier
days
of
Brentwood
's
time
,
many
city
dwellers
rode
stagecoaches
on
Brownsville
Road
,
because
this
was
the
only
major
roadway
connecting
the
cities
of
Pittsburgh
and
Brownsville
.

The
White
Hall
Tavern
was
just
a
short
walk
to
the
race
track
which
was
once
on
the
site
of
the
South
Hills
Country
Club
,
which
is
why
many
people
from
the
city
stopped
here
for
relaxation
.

The
Windsor
Hotel
was
opened
in

.

Although
there
was
a
fire
sixteen
years
later
,
it
was
rebuilt
and
remained
a
popular
place
for
vacationers
.

The
Davis
Farm
House
was
another
historical
place
in
Brentwood
’s
history
,
although
it
was
gained
by
the
borough
in
0000
.

The
house
and
grounds
became
a
senior
citizens
’
recreation
center
.

Much
debate
was
encountered
when
it
was
considered
being
torn
down
to
build
a
new
firehouse
and
recreation
room
.

Although
the
house
had
been
considered
a
historical
site
by
much
of
the
town
,
it
was
eventually
torn
down
,
and
the
new
fire
house
was
built
in

of

communities
History
The
village
that

acquired
its
name
because

The
main
employers
were
steel
mills
such
as
Superior
Steel
&
Union
Electric
Steel
.

Carnegie
had
a
rail
yard
that
had
connections
to
several
railroads
early
in
the
twentieth
century
,
including
the
Wabash
Pittsburgh
Terminal
railroad
,
and
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

In
the
0000s
,
Carnegie
suffered
economically
with
the
closure
of
the
great
steel
mills
such
as
J
&
L
in
and
around
Pittsburgh
.

In
0000
,
Imperial
Wizard
Hiram
Evans
and
ten
thousand
Ku
Klux
Klan
members
tried
to
march
through
the
streets
of
Carnegie
.

The
town
's
large
Catholic
population
refused
to
let
the
Klan
march
through
the
streets
.

Violence
broke
out
,
one
Klansman
was
killed
and
hundreds
of
others
wounded
.

Protestant
membership
in
the
KKK
of
the
0000s
grew
as
the
population
of
Catholic
families
in
town
increased
.

By
0000
,
Carnegie
had
one
of
the
largest
Klans
in
the
state
.

In
0000
,
Carnegie
was
significantly
damaged
by
flooding
as
a
result
of
Hurricane
Ivan
.

Much
of
the
commercial
section
of
the
borough
,
as
well
as
the
borough
's
Roman
Catholic
churches
,
were
closed
or
damaged
.

Culture
Carnegie
is
religiously
diverse
.

There
are
two
Orthodox
Churches
(
Ukrainian

,
a
Ukrainian
Catholic
church
,
a
Methodist
church
,
An
Episcopal
church
,
a
Polish
Catholic
church
and
a
synagogue
.

The
churches
were
primarily
responsible
for
assisting
the
community
after
Hurricane
Ivan
.

History
The
first
families
settled
Castle
Shannon
in
0000
in
pursuit
of
farmland
and
timber
.

The
most
prominent
farm
was
owned
by
David
Strawbridge
,
who
named
it
Castle
Shanahan
.

Over
time
,
the
farm
would
lend
its
name
to
the
area
,
as
"
Shanahan
"
would
evolve
into
"
Shannon
"
.

In
0000
,
the
Pittsburgh
and
Castle
Shannon
Railroad
line
was
completed
,
providing
a
direct
link
from
Pittsburgh
to
the
then-village
of
Castle
Shannon
.

Development
was
stimulated
by
two
years
of
free
transportation
and
lumber
transport
given
to
anybody
building
a
home
.

In
0000
,
a
second
railroad
was
built
from
Finleyville
through
Castle
Shannon
to
the
West
End
neighborhood
of
Pittsburgh
.

In
0000
,
the
right
of
way
through
the
valley
containing
Castle
Shannon
was
purchased
by
the
Pittsburgh
Railroad
.

This
helped
lead
to
Castle
Shannon
becoming
a
center
for
coal
mining
,
with
eight
mines
in
operation
in
0000
.

The
Pittsburgh
and
West
Virginia
Railroad
,
still
active
today
,
came
shortly
afterward
.

The
First
National
Bank
in
Castle
Shannon
was
the
site
of
a
much
publicized
bank
robbery
in
0000
.

$
00,000
was
taken
in
the
robbery
,
of
which
$
00,000
was
immediately
recovered
from
one
man
shot
during
the
escape
.

The
full
sum
was
never
recovered
.

Castle
Shannon
was
incorporated

History
Cheswick
,
named
for
a
town
in
England
,
is
a
small
town
of
about
.

The
history
of
the
lands
of
Cheswick
seems
to
have
belonged
to
the
Keen
family
at
least
in
part
,
for
Archie
Pillow
,
or
Pillar
,
as
spelled
in
old
records
,
inherited
land
from
the
Keen
family
.

That
land
,
in
part
,
is
where
Cheswick
is
today
.

Archie
's
brother
,
George
,
once
owned
the
second
oldest
house
in
the
community
.

Thomas
Pillow
owned
the
land
from
Highland
Avenue
to
the
Harmar
Township
line
.

The
level
land
near
the
Allegheny
River
was
used
as
farmland
(
Borland
farm
)
.

Borland
&
Truck
farms
sold
vegetables
to
Pittsburgh
in
the
days
of
the
canal
.

Barges
and
rafts
of
lumber
were
floated
down
the
river
to
the
steel
mills
.

The
men
were
fed
by
women
who
took
baked
goods
out
to
the
slow-moving
barges
in
boats
.

In
the
days
of
the
canal
,
wealthy
families
built
great
Victorian
houses
along
the
canal
.

Later
,
when
the
railroad
bought
out
the
right
of
way
,
the
noise
and
dust
became
disturbing
and
many
houses
became
run
down
and
neglected
.

Among
the
early
names
are
Borland
,
Pillows
,
Macleans
,
Wilsons
,
Stewarts
,
Lemons
,
Albertsons
,
Buntings
,
Cummings
,
Shoops
and
Armstrongs
.

The
Armstrong
family
lived
in
Acmetonia
until
after
the
Civil
War
.

One
built
the
fine
stone
house
next
to
the
Cheswick
Theater
,
and
he
served
as
postmaster
in
the
borough
.

Before
the
days
of
the
railroad
,
a
tavern
was
located
where
the
former
station
would
later
be
built
.

People
traveling
to
Pittsburgh
by
carriage
probably
stopped
for
refreshment
.

The
road
between
Pittsburgh
and
Freeport
was
filled
by
farmers
driving
cattle
to
market
in
Pittsburgh
,
peddler
wagons
taking
goods
to
country
housewives
,
businessmen
going
to
Pittsburgh
,
and
officials
going
to
court
for
the
day
.

When
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
completed
,
the
land
was
divided
and
sold
in
sections
and
lots
.

For
a
time
,
few
were
sold
and
growth
was
slow
.

The
town
name
became
Lincoln
but
had
to
be
changed
,
for
there
were
other
communities
by
the
same
name
.

It
was
not
until
0000
that
the
name
Cheswick
was
adopted
at
the
first
council
meeting
.

The
streets
were
named
for
trees
,
such
as
Beech
,
Pine
and
Spruce
.

The
President
of
the
Council
was
H.J.
Hutchinson
.

The
second
ordinance
dealt
with
the
public
health
of
the
community
.

Houses
,
sewage
,
garbage
,
slaughterhouses
were
considered
and
fines
stated
.

Later
ordinances
provided
for
paved
streets
and
sidewalks
.

One
of
the
first
industries
was
the
Penwick
Distillery
.

In
a
large
brick
building
,
the
liquor
was
stored
for
years
before
it
was
sold
.

Several
small
factories
were
built
,
but
coal
,
river
sand
and
gravel
were
the
most
important
.

Many
of
the
residents
traveled
by
train
each
day
to
work
in
offices
and
stores
.

The
Cheswick
Fire
Department
was
founded
in
the
early
0000s
.

In
early
times
,
the
children
went
to
school
near
Deer
Creek
in
Harmar
Township
.

Later
,
a
school
was
built
on
Pittsburgh
Road
not
far
from
the
site
of
the
old
Cheswick
elementary
school
.

The
Borough
Council
met
in
the
school
building
at
that
time
,
and
all
of
its
papers
were
kept
there
.

In
0000
,
fire
destroyed
the
interior
of
the
old
school
,
burning
most
of
the
records
of
the
young
borough
of
Cheswick
.

A
newer
and
bigger
Cheswick
School
was
planned
under
the
Allegheny
Valley
Joint
Schools
expansion
program
.

Today
,
the
old
elementary
school
is
part
of
the
Cheswick
Christian
Academy
.

The
Presbyterian
Church
was
originally
part
of
the
old
church
built

farm
.

Around
0000
,
Mathew
Maclean
donated
land
for
the
Presbyterian
Church
,
and
it
was
built
at
a
cost
of
$
0,000.00
with
a
membership
of
seventeen
.

The
Reverend
James
Boyd
was
an
early
minister
of

History
Clairton
’s
existence
began
just
after
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
when
the
Crucible
Steel
Company
acquired
a
large
tract
along
the
west
side
of

Monongahela
River
,
about
south
of

.

Soon

,
the

)
built
an
integrated
steel
mill
and
coke
production
facility
,
which
eventually
became

of
the
world
's
largest
.

The
site

,
growth

advancement
indicated
a
thriving
city
.

As
the
steel
mill
and

production
facilities

life
of

a
business
district
and
educational
,
religious
,
and
cultural
facilities

signaling
a
trend
that
has
continued
until
today
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
Clairton
High
School
(
CHS
)
had
a
large
student
body
,
and
the
city
had
a
"
feeder
"
system
of
public
and
parochial
elementary
schools
.

The
CHS
student
body
was
soon
siphoned
off
,
however
,
by
new
schools
in
Elizabeth
Borough
,
Snowden
Township
,
and
Jefferson
Borough
.

During
the
mid-0000s
and
into
the
0000s
,
CHS
was
a
Class
AAA
competitor
in
the
formidable
Western
Pennsylvania
Interscholastic
Athletic
League
(
WPIAL
)
,
playing
against
high
schools
in
other
mill
towns
up
and
down
the
Monongahela
River
Valley
.

With
the
decline
of
the
steel
industry
in
the
0000s
,
Clairton
began
to
experience
severe
problems
in
its
employment
and
tax
base
,
which
spurred
a
major
economic
shock
to
the
community
.

In
0000
,
Clairton
was
designated
a
distressed
municipality
by
Pennsylvania
's
Department
of
Community
Affairs
(
DCA
)
.

Pursuant
to
Act
00
of
0000
(
the
Financially
Distressed
Municipalities
Act
)
,
DCA
commissioned
the
development
of
a
recovery
plan
for
Clairton
.

By
0000
,
the
Clairton
School
District
had
consolidated
its
entire
system
into
a
single
building
(
a
remodeled
version
of
the
high
school
)
and
closed
its
other
schools
.

Clairton
High
now
competes
at
the
Class
A
level
in
the
WPIAL
.

The
high
school
football
team
has
had
national
prominence
for
recent
success
.

Economic
development
The
downtown
area
is
the
remnant
of
a
once
thriving
shopping
district
,
while
the
residential
areas
are
the
remains
of
housing
built
for
Clairton
Works
employees
.

The
collapse
of
the
steel
industry
left
a
large
portion
of
the
population
jobless
,
and
large
parts
of
the
city
have
descended
into
poverty
and
crime
.

The
city
lacks
the
funding
to
carry
out
the
demolition
of
condemned
buildings
,
so
empty
storefronts
and
abandoned
houses
plague
the
area
.

Local
groups
have
tried
to
encourage
recovery
,
but
have
been
unsuccessful
due
to
lack
of
funding
or
interest
.

One
of
these
groups
,
the
Community
Economic
Development
Corporation
of
Clairton
(
CEDCC
)
,
in
conjunction
with
Allegheny
County
,
the
Allegheny
County
Housing
Authority
,
and
state
government
,
recently
finished
construction
of
a
single-family
housing
development
to
encourage
people
to
own
rather
than
rent
.

As
another
move
toward
recovery
,
Clairton
recently
introduced
Land
Value
Taxation
(
LVT
)
,
which
is
based
on
the
economic
philosophies
of
Henry
George
,
Thomas
Paine
,
Adam
Smith
and
others
.

This
move
has
reduced
taxation
for
almost
all
homeowners
.

The
revenue
garnered
from
land
is
now
00.0
%
as
opposed
to
00.0
%
without
LVT
(
most
of
the
burden
of
the
property
tax
has
shifted
away
from
what
people
build
or
buy
)
.

Dormont
is
a
borough
in
Allegheny
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
and
is
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Metro
Area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
and
is
the
most
densely
populated
municipality
in
Allegheny
County
.

Dormont
is
a
home
to
a
diverse
population
including
young
professionals
,
working
families
,
and
retirees
.

Dormont
's
economic
stability
can
be
attributed
to
this
diversity
along
with
its
close
proximity
to
jobs
in
Downtown
Pittsburgh
,
access
to
The
"
T
"
(
Pittsburgh
Light
Rail
)
,
diverse
housing
stock
,
and
historically
low
crime
rates
.

Dormont
is
mixed
use
and
urban
and
features
a
pedestrian
friendly
business
district
,
with
bars
,
coffee
shops
,
restaurants
,
and
retail
stores
.

It
is
famous
for
one
of
the
largest
municipal
pools
in
Pennsylvania
,
the
historic
Dormont
Pool
.

Loosely
translated
,
Dormont
means
"
Mountain
of
Gold
"
in
French
.

History
Dormont
was
originally
fashioned
from
parts
of
Scott
and
Union
Townships
.

An
order
of
incorporation
was
signed
on
March
00
,
0000
,
making
Dormont
the
first
independent
municipality
in
the
South
Hills
of
Allegheny
County
.

Municipal
officials
initially
wanted
to
name
the
new
community
"
Mt.
Lebanon
,
"
however
objections
were
raised
by
their
as
yet
unincorporated
neighbors
to
the
south
who
eventually
adopted
the
name
.

Instead
the
name
Dormont
was
chosen
from
the
Americanized
version
of
the
French
term
"
mont
d'or
"
,
loosely
translated
as
"
Mountain
of
Gold
.
"

The
first
election
of
Borough
officials
was
held
on
April
00
,
0000
.

Dormont
later
annexed
part
of
Scott
Township
in
0000
,
two
additional
parts
of
Union
Township
in
0000
and
0000
,
and
a
portion
of
Mt.
Lebanon
Township
in
January
0000
,
giving
it
a
total
area
of
just
less
than
one
square
mile
.

With
the
construction
of
the
streetcar
tunnel
and
the
Liberty
Tunnel
s
came
rapid
growth
.

A
town
without
"
streets
"
Once
the
borough
of
Dormont
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
at
least
00
different
streets
were
given
new
names
.

Today
,
all
but
two
of
Dormont
's
streets
are
designated
as
avenues
,
the
exceptions
being
Memorial
Drive
and
Park
Blvd.
.

Two
of
Dormont
's
mainline
streets
,
Scott
Road
and
McFarland
Road
,
are
two-lane
"
borough
line
"
streets
in
which
one
lane
is
located
in
Dormont
and
the
other
in
Mt.
Lebanon
.

The
northern
stretch
of
another
"
borough
line
"
street
,
McNeilly
Avenue
,
runs
through
Dormont
on
one
side
and
the
Pittsburgh
neighborhood
of
Brookline
on
the
other
.

Before
the
incorporation
and
street
name
changes
,
Dormont
actually
had
three
designated
"
streets
"
:
Beech
St.
(
Dwight
Ave.
)
,
Sycamore
St.
(
Philadelphia
Ave.
)
,
and
Sylvester
St.
(
Texas
Ave.
)
.

Leisure
Through
the
years
,
the
convenience
of
the
borough
,
plus
the
amenities
offered
its
residents
,
has
kept
it
densely
populated
.

Its
citizens
enjoy
one
of
the
largest
swimming
pools
in
Pennsylvania
(
>
00,000
square
feet
)
,
two
parks
,
basketball
and
tennis
courts
,
two
Little
League
fields
,
a
fine
library
,
an
impressive
volunteer-built
children
's
playground
,
as
well
as
seasonal
activities
for
both
children
and
adults
.
"

Dormont

,
"
the
annual
Fourth

culminating
with
one

,
named
after

.

In

,
the
old
middle
school
was
demolished
and
Keystone
Oaks
High
School
expanded
to
include
Keystone
Oaks
Middle

.

A
brand
new
building
for
the
grade
school
was
then
built
,
bringing
together
students
from
the
two
previous
grade
schools
,
Kelton
and
Hillsdale
.

The
Kelton
School
building
,
located
on
a

adjacent
to
Keystone
Oaks
(

Kelton
&

)

,
no

French
and
Indian
Wars
For
the
next
00
years
,
all
the
land
at
the
forks
of
the
Ohio
River
was
the
subject
of
contention
between
French
and
English
.

Indian
allies
of
both
empires
fought
settlers
for
control
of
the
region
.

French
soldiers
built
Fort
Duquesne
on
the
site
of
a
former
British
outpost
at
the
forks
of
the
Ohio
in
0000
,
and
four
years
later
British
troops
replaced
it
with
a
fort
of
their
own
,
Fort
Pitt
.

The
bloody
battles
of
Braddock
's
defeat
,
Bushy
Run
,
and
Colonel
Bouquet
's
relief
of
the
Indian
siege
of
Pittsburgh
provided
many
British
and
Virginia
scalps
,
which
were
triumphantly
brought
home
to
adorn
wigwam
s
situated
in
what
is
now
Fox
Chapel
.

The
Revolutionary
War
,
too
,
produced
further
military
activity
.

Guyasuta
Through
this
warlike
panorama
moved
the
Seneca
chief
,
Guyasuta
,
closely
associated
with
the
district
,
involved
in
every
clash
,
sometimes
aiding
the
English
and
sometimes
the
French
.

He
first
appeared
as
George
Washington
's
guide
during
his
journey
from
Logstown
to
Fort
Le
Boeuf
in
0000
.

Guyasuta
led
the
Indians
against
General
Grant
in
0000
.

He
was
probably
the
leader
of
the
Seneca
band
that
destroyed
Fort
Venango
in
0000
,
butchering
the
entire
garrison
.

He
was
in
a
band
of
warriors
that
burned
the
frontier
village
of
Hannastown
,
north
of
Greensburg
.

He
was
also
at
the
Battle
of
Bushy
Run
,
where
the
Indians
were
defeated
by
Colonel
Bouquet
.

Despite
Chief
Guyasuta
's
violent
history
,
General
O'Hara
furnished
a
cabin
for
him
on
O'Hara
's
estate
north
of
the
Allegheny
River
(
now
Fox
Chapel
)
,
and
provided
necessities
during
the
declining
years
of
his
life
.

He
died
about

Settlement
The
first
white
settler
in
the
area
was
James
Powers
,
who
arrived
around

The
first
schoolhouse
was
on
Squaw
Run
,
where
it
stood
in
0000
.

It
was
a
log
house
.

A
church
was
organized
in
0000
on
Kittanning
Road
,
on
a
branch
of
Pine
Creek
.

Among
the
early
landowners
was
James
O'Hara
,
a
Revolutionary
Army
general
and
prominent
Pittsburgh
businessman
.

During
the
depression
of
0000
,
he
was
saved
from
financial
ruin
by
the
counsel
of
James
Ross
,
a
noted
lawyer
and
former
senator
.

In
exchange
for
his
help
,
O'Hara
gave
Ross
of
land
,
which
is
now
part
of
Fox
Chapel
,
and
comprises
the
Delafield
Estates
section
of
the
borough
,
as
well
as
the
development
along
Buckingham
Road
known
as
the
"
Ross
Meadows
Plan
of
Lots
"
.

In
general
,
there
was
little
growth
or
development
throughout
the
00th
century
,
and
it
remained
for
the
00th
,
with
the
advent
of
the
automobile
,
for
Pittsburghers
to
become
aware
of
the
advantages
of
the
Fox

In

,
approximately
00
landowners
assembled
at

voted
to
incorporate
the
Fox

Association
.

The
matters
of
immediate
concern
that
they
addressed
were
fire
and
police
protection
.

As
time
went
on
,
the
District
Association
named
roads
and
handled
development
and
zoning
.

However
,
by

the
District
Association
had
grown
concerned
that
its
interests
were
at
variance
with
those
of
both
townships
,
and
a
petition
was
filed
to
allow
the
formation
of
a
new
borough
.

Despite
vigorous
opposition
by
both
townships
,
on
August
0
,
0000
,
a
court
ordered
the
incorporation
of
Fox
Chapel
Borough
from
of
O'Hara
Township
and
of
Indiana
Township
.

Over
the
years
,
other
residents
adjacent
to
the
borough
petitioned
the
council
for
annexation
,
increasing
the
area
of
the
borough
to
approximately

Its
wooded
hills
and
uncrowded
residential
developments
are
a
regional
asset

It

History
Before
Glassport
was
its
own
borough
,
the
territory
was
part
of
Elizabeth
Twp.
,
then
of
Lincoln
Twp.
,
then
Port
Vue
,
PA.
.

In
0000
,
it
became
its
own
separate
municipality
,
comprising
0.00
square
miles
.

The
town
was
built
around
a
mill
called
The
United
States
Glass
Co.
,
that
chose
that
site
in
0000
.

The
factory
came
to
be
known
as
“
the
Glass
House
”
.

Other
industries
soon
followed
.

The
area
was
originally
laid
out
in
a
plot
plan
by
the
Glassport
Land
Co.
,
a
subsidiary
of
the
United
States
Glass
Co.
.

Glassport
received
its
name
after
the
Glassport
Land
Company
.

The
Unites
States
Glass
Co.
,
which
was
located
near
the
Monongahela
River
on
Seventh
Street
.

The
company
specialized
in
"
pressed
glass
,
"
tableware
,
and
other
glass
products
made
from
molds
.

Unfortunately
,
in
0000
the
United
States
Glass
Company
was
damaged
by
a
tornado
,
and
their
00-foot
water
tower
collapsed
through
the
building
's
roof
.

When
the
high
winds
did
this
,
all
the
furnaces
shut
down
and
the
liquid
glass
cooled
and
hardened
.

Afterwards
there
was
left
a
000
ton
block
of
solid
glass
,
making
any
plans
to
re-build
too
costly
.

Homestead
is
a
borough
in
Allegheny
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
USA
,
in
the
Monongahela
River
valley
southeast
of
downtown
Pittsburgh
and
directly
across
the
river
from
the
city
limit
line
.

The
borough
is
known
for
the
Homestead
Strike
of
0000
,
an
important
event
in
the
history
of
labor
relations
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
of
Homestead
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
area
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Monongahela
River
now
comprising
the
boroughs
of
Homestead
,
Munhall
and
West
Homestead
saw
the
first
white
settlers
arrive
in
the
0000s
.

One
hundred
years
later
,
much
of
the
existing
farmland
on
the
flats
and
hillsides
by
the
river
was
purchased
,
laid
out
in
lots
and
sold
by
local
banks
and
land
owners
to
create
the
town
of
Homestead
.

The
town
was
chartered
in
0000
.

The
building
of
a
railroad
,
glass
factory
,
and
in
0000
the
first
iron
mill
began
a
period
of
rapid
growth
and
prosperity
.

In
0000
,
Andrew
Carnegie
bought
out
Homestead
Steel
Works
,
adding
it
to
his
empire
of
steel
and
coke
enterprises
.

Carnegie
had
recently
acquired
a
controlling
interest
in
Henry
Clay
Frick
's
coke
works
on
the
Monongahela
,
setting
the
stage
for
the
dramatic
labor
clash
in
Homestead
.

Homestead
gained
international
notoriety
in
July
0000
as
the
site
of
a
violent
clash
between
locked-out
steelworkers
and
hired
Pinkerton
guards
,
known
as
the
Homestead
Strike
.

When
Henry
Clay
Frick
,
manager
for
Andrew
Carnegie
,
owner
of
the
local
Homestead
Steel
Works
,
announced
in
the
spring
of
0000
that
skilled
workers
would
receive
a
reduction
in
wages
,
the
advisory
committee
of
the
Amalgamated
Association
of
Iron
and
Steel
Workers
refused
to
sign
a
new
contract
.

Carnegie
's
management
locked
the
workforce
out
,
declaring
that
the
union
would
no
longer
be
recognized
at
the
steel
works
.

To
break
the
strike
and
secure
the
mill
from
the
disgruntled
workers
,
industrialist
Henry
Clay
Frick
hired
hundreds
of
armed
toughs
from
the
Pinkerton
National
Detective
Agency
.

When
barges
carrying
the
Pinkertons
arrived
at
the
mill
on
the
morning
of
July
0
,
workers
and
townspeople
met
them
at
the
riverbanks
.

Though
eyewitness
accounts
differed
on
which
side
first
fired
a
shot
,
a
day-long
armed
battle
ensued
which
resulted
in
eleven
deaths
and
dozens
of
injuries
.

The
governor
of
Pennsylvania
eventually
called
out
the
National
Guard
to
restore
order
to
the
town
and
take
control
of
the
mill
.

Frick
successfully
destroyed
the
union
in
Homestead
and
,
by
extension
,
in
most
of
his
other
steel
mills
through
the
nation
.

The
"
Battle
of
Homestead
,
"
as
the
event
came
to
be
known
,
represented
a
stunning
setback
for
unionization
in
the
highly-mechanized
steel
industry
.

It
also
set
the
stage
for
the
future
steel
strike
of
0000
,
in
which
Homestead
played
an
important
role
.

At
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
,
in
0000
,
the
population
of
Homestead
was
00,000
people
,
of
whom
some
0,000
were
employed
in
the
plants
.

Due
mostly
to
immigration
from
Eastern
and
Southern
Europe
,
by
0000
the
population
jumped
to
00,000
,
then
to
00,000
in
0000
.

In
the
first
decade
of
the
00th
century
,
Homestead
was
studied
as
part
of
the
sociological
Pittsburgh
Survey
,
the
results
of
which
were
eventually
published
as
Homestead
:
The
Households
of
a
Mill
Town
.

In
0000
,
00,000
people
lived
in
Homestead
.

During
the
early
0000s
half
the
population
was
displaced
as
the
United
States
government
added
on
to
the
steel
mills
to
have
the
capacity
for
armor
plating
for
ships
and
tanks
(
preparing
for
World
War
II
)
.

After
the
end
of
the
war
,
a
decline
in
the
steel-making
industry
of
the
United
States
took
place
.

By
0000
,
it
had
become
difficult
to
obtain
employment
at
the
Homestead
Works
,
which
was
not
producing
much
steel
at
that
time
.

In
0000
,
the
mill
closed
and
the
Homestead
Works
was
demolished
,
replaced
in
0000
by
The
Waterfront
shopping
mall
.

As
a
direct
result
of
the
loss
of
mill
employment
,
the
number
of
people
living
in
Homestead
dwindled
.

By
the
time
of
the
0000
census
,
the
borough
population
was
0,000
.

The
borough
began
financially
recovering
in
0000
,
with
the
enlarging
retail
tax
base
.

structure
that
served
as
headquarters
for

strikers
during

by

at

.

The
Bost
Building
was
declared
a
National
Landmark
in

It
is
located
at
000
East
Eighth

.

It
now
houses

Much
of
Homestead
and
some
of
the
surrounding
communities
are
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
as
the
Homestead
Historic
District
.

Many
churches
,
commercial
buildings
,
and
homes
date
to
the
late
00th
century
or
early
00th
century
and
are
of
architectural
and
historic
interest
.

Unfortunately
,
since
the
closing
of
the
steel
mills
in
the
0000s
,
the
population
and
business
district
of
Homestead
have
seriously
declined
,
causing
many
older
buildings
to
be
abandoned
.

The
final
nail
in
the
coffin
of
the
formerly
thriving
business
district
,
mainly
along
0th
Avenue
,
was
the
opening
of
many
big
box
chain
stores
and
restaurants
in
the
new
(
0000s
)
Waterfront
development
.

The
Carnegie
Library
of
Homestead
was
opened
to
the
public
in
0000
.

This
historic
building
,
located
on
East
00th
Avenue
in
the
neighboring
borough
of
Munhall
,
now
houses
,
in
addition
to
a
public
library
,
a
music
hall
and
athletic
club
open
to
the
public
.

The
impressive
stone
architecture
of
the
building
is
set
off
by
the
surrounding
park
.

The
library
is
one
of
only
three
that
Andrew
Carnegie
provided
with
an
endowment
.

Some
claim
it
was
a
peace
offering
to
the
community
following
the
events
of
the
steel
strike
in
0000
,
and
that
as
such
it
was
rejected
by
Homestead
,
which
is
why
it
is
in
Munhall
instead
.

In
fact
,
the
plans
were
already
in
the
works
for
the
building
of
the
library
before
the
strike
,
and
the
Borough
of
Munhall
had
not
been
incorporated
when
the
library
was
built
.

Also
not
technically
in
Homestead
proper
,
but
located
just
west
of
the
borough
,
is
the
popular
waterpark
,
Sandcastle
,
with
waterslides
,
pools
and
waterside
nightclub
adjacent
to
the
Monongahela
River
.

Sandcastle
's
sister
location
for
summertime
fun
is
Kennywood
,
located
in
West
Mifflin
,
about
east
of
Homestead
.

This
historic
amusement
park
has
been
a
family
destination
for
generations
of
Pittsburghers
.

It
is
home
to
some
of
the
best
known
and
loved
wooden
roller
coaster
rides
.

In
0000
,
Continental
Realestate
Companies
opened
The
Waterfront
.

This
large
"
lifestyle
"
shopping
center
was
built
on
the
former
site
of
the
Carnegie
Steel
Works
.

Most
of
the
structures
associated
with
the
steel
mills
on
this
site
were
demolished
during
construction
.

Still
standing
in
the
Waterfront
development
are
some
of
the
brick
stacks
from
the
Homestead
Steel
Works
.

In
addition
,
near
the
river
is
a
former
mill
structure
known
as
the
Pump
House
which
was
restored
by
the
developer
.

Transportation
An
important
state

Homestead
.

Interstate

Fair
Oaks
Volunteer
Fire
Department
The
original
volunteer
fire
department
was
organized
July
00
,
0000
with
fifty
members
through
February
,
0000
.

Charles
W.
McNamee
was
the
first
Chief
.

He
held
this
office
during
the
year
0000
,
prior
to
moving
to
Ambridge
.

Listed
as
honorary
and
contributing
members
at
that
time
were
A.
J.
Minke
,
Claud
Davis
and
W.
R.
Motz
.

No
activities
were
recorded
from
0000
until
October
0000
when
there
was
a
fire
in
a
dwelling
on
Mound
Street
.

The
call
was
responded
to
by
the
Ambridge
Fire
Department
.

Immediately
after
that
incident
a
call
was
issued
for
the
formation
of
a
local
fire
department
.

At
that
meeting
there
was
an
overflow
crowd
and
the
Fair
Oaks
Volunteer
Fire
Department
was
formed
.

The
first
equipment
inherited
by
the
reorganized
department
was
a
hand-drawn
hose
cart
which
was
located
in
a
frame
shed
on
Ledge
Street
near
the
Fair
Oaks
School
.

Practice
sessions
were
held
every
Saturday
out
Ambridge
Avenue
,
which
was
a
dirt
road
at
the
time
,
and
was
a
test
of
strength
and
energy
.

Land
on
Beech
Street
was
purchased
from
the
Fair
Oaks
Land
Company
and
the
shed
was
moved
there
during
the
summer
of
0000
.

A
few
years
later
the
department
moved
the
shed
and
constructed
a
fire
station
consisting
of
a
front
room
a
double
garage
.

A
large
back
room
was
added
in
later
years
.

The
first
truck
purchased
was
an
American
LaFrance
equipped
Ford
.

A
fully
equipped
Ambulance
was
also
purchased
.

The
second
truck
,
truck

Firefighter
equipped
Chevrolet
.

Free
ambulance
service
was
provided

Oswald
Teichmüller
(
00
June
0000
–
ca
.

September
0000
)
was
a
German
mathematician
who
introduced
quasiconformal
mapping
s
and
differential
geometric
methods
into
complex
analysis
.

Life
Teichmüller
was
born
in
Nordhausen
.

He
grew
up
in
Sankt
Andreasberg
and
earned
his
Abitur
in
0000
.

In
the
same
year
he
started
studying
mathematics
at
the
University
of
Göttingen
.

Among
his
professors
were
Richard
Courant
,
Hermann
Weyl
,
Otto
Neugebauer
,
Gustav
Herglotz
,
and
Edmund
Landau
.

Teichmüller
received
his
doctorate
in
0000
under
Helmut
Hasse
.

He
joined
the
Nazi
Party
in
July
0000
and
became
a
member
of
the
Sturmabteilung
in
August
0000
.

In
0000
he
organized
the
boycott
of
his
Jewish
professor
Edmund
Landau
.

In
0000
and
0000
he
attended
lectures
by
Nevanlinna
,
who
sympathized
with
the
Third
Reich
,
where
he
was
a
guest
professor
and
,
like
Brouwer
,
was
considered
by
the
Nazis
as
"
politically
reliable
"
(
Rudolf
Heß
was
in
charge
of
the
assessment
)
.

Under
the
influence
of
Nevanlinna
,
Teichmüller
specialized
in
geometric
function
theory
.

Upon
personal
authorisation
from
the
Führer
,
he
joined
the
Wehrmacht
in
0000
and
was
killed
fighting
on
the
Eastern
Front
.

Mathematics
The
theory
of
Teichmüller
space
s
(
a
moduli
space
theory
for
Riemann
surface
s
)
was
developed
by
Lars
Ahlfors
,
Lipman
Bers
and
others
.

The
Teichmüller
representative
or
Teichmüller
character
is
a
construction
with
p-adic
number
s.
Much
of
Teichmüller
's
work
was
published
in
Deutsche
Mathematik
,
a
highly
ideological
journal
founded
by
Ludwig
Bieberbach
that
contained
not
only
scholarly
articles
but
also
race
propaganda
.

Because
of
the
nature
of
the
journal
,
his
papers
were
hard
to
find
in
modern
libraries
before
the
publication
of
his
collected
works

History
For
thousands
of
years
,
Native
Americans
inhabited
the
region
.

The
Adena
culture
built
a
large
mound
at
the
future
site
of
McKees
Rocks
.

The
mound
,
a
burial
site
,
was
augmented
in
later
years
by
members
of
the
Hopewell
culture
.

Much
later
,
it
was
considered
by
George
Washington
as
a
possible
location
for
Fort
Pitt
,
which
was
eventually
built
on
the
site
of
the
destroyed
French
Fort
Duquesne
in
what
is
now
Pittsburgh
's
Point
State
Park
.

The
borough
derives
its
name
from
Alexander
McKee
,
to
whom
a
tract
of
land
was
given
in
0000
,
and
from
a
rocky
projection
into
the
river
at
this
site
.

In

,
McKees
Rocks
officially
got
its
name
on

deed
,

year
is

to
be
its
founding
date
.

In

Singer
Avenue
in
McKees
Rocks
.

It
was
built
around

,
although
other
sources
put
the
construction
in
the
00th
century
.

It
is
rumored
that
George
Washington
stayed
there
when
he
was
surveying
the
Indian
mound
.

On
October

,
0000
,
Mann
's
Hotel
was
condemned
due
to
neglect
and
had

McKees
Rocks
lent
its
name
to
one
of
the
pivotal
labor
conflicts
of
the
early
00th
century
,
the
0000
McKees
Rocks
Strike

others
who
worked
for
the
Standard
Steel
Car
Company
of
Butler
and
others
in
New
Castle
.

The
strike
,
led
by
organizers
of
the
Industrial
Workers
of
the
World
,
was
repressed
by

,
resulting

least
a
dozen
deaths
,
involving
participants
on
both
sides
.

McKeesport
is
a
city
in
Allegheny
County
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Pennsylvania
;
it
is
situated
at
the
confluence
of
the
Monongahela
and
Youghiogheny
rivers
and
is
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Metro
Area
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
second-largest
city
(
not
including
townships
,
boroughs
,
and
Home
Rule
Municipalities
)
in
the
county
after
Pittsburgh
.

Settled
in
0000
and
named
in
honor
of
John
McKee
,
its
founder
,
McKeesport
remained
a
village
until
0000
when
coal
mining
began
in
the
region
.

Large
deposits
of
bituminous
coal
existed
.

McKeesport
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
and
as
a
city
in
0000
.

Its
population
grew
steadily
until
the

;
and
in
0000
,
00,000
.

The
decrease
in
the
population
since
the
0000s
is
attributable
to
the

economic
malaise
that

upon
the
region
when
the
steelmaking
industry
moved
elsewhere
.

The

employer
was
the

Moon
Township
is
a
township
along
the
Ohio
River
in
Allegheny
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Moon
is
a
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Metro
Area
and
is
located
northwest
of
Pittsburgh
.

The
origin
of
its
name
is
unknown
;
historians
suggest
it
was
derived
from
a
crescent-shaped
bend
in
the
river
.

Local
lore
tells
of
a
waning
crescent
moon
that
descended
to
plow
furrows
in
farmer
's
fields
with
its
sharp
cusp
,
but
killed
many
excited
witnesses
who
cursed
and
praised
the
moon
's
early
morning
activities
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Early
history
(
0000-0000
)
The
initial
settlement
of
Moon
Township
was
a
direct
result
of
the
westward
expansion
of
English
settlers
and
traders
who
arrived
in
the
Ohio
Valley
in
the
early
to
mid-00th
century
.

During
the
French
and
Indian
War
(
Seven
Years
'
War
)
,
the
Iroquois
,
which
controlled
the
land
for
hunting
grounds
through
right
of
conquest
,
ceded
large
parcels
of
southwestern
Pennsylvania
lands
through
treaty
or
abandonment
to
settlers
;
in
some
cases
,
the
land
was
already
occupied
by
squatters
.

The
ceding
of
these
lands
occurred
either
through
early
treaties
or
outright
abandonment
by
the
Iroquois
nation
,
the
avowed
owners
of
the
land
.

Indian
settlements
of
the
south
bank
of
the
Ohio
River
typically
relocated
to
more
populous
areas
of
the
north
bank
in
the
current
locales
of
Sewickley
,
Aliquippa
and
Ambridge
.

On
the
southern
banks
of
the
Ohio
,
political
disputes
among
settlers
clouded
the
disposition
of
lands
.

Generally
,
the
Pennsylvania
Land
Office
apportioned
land
to
owners
through
grants
.

But
,
some
of
the
land
encompassing
what
is
now
the
Coraopolis
Heights
,
Thorn
Run
valley
,
and
Narrows
Run
valley
were
claimed
through
the
process
of
"
Tomahawk
Improvements
"
.

Settlement
processes
were
often
convoluted
because
of
differences
among
land
policies
of
the
several
colonies
claiming
the
land
,
specifically
Pennsylvania
and
Virginia
.

Each
colony
had
its
own
means
of
either
granting
or
restricting
settlement
opportunities
.

Each
settler
claiming
land
in
what
is
now
Moon
Township
had
to
go
through
a
multi-level
process
of
application
for
grant
,
warrant
of
property
,
and
survey
to
ensure
the
physical
boundaries
of
the
property
,
and
patent
approval
whereby
the
applicant
paid
for
the
land
and
title
was
conferred
.

On
April
0
,
0000
,
Andrew
Montour
,
an
Indian
interpreter
who
had
provided
service
to
the
English
settler
s
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
,
was
granted
one
of
the
first
land
patents
for
approximately
of
what
later
became
the
borough
of
Coraopolis
and
Neville
Island
.

In
0000
,
the
settler
John
Meek
was
awarded
a
land
grant
from
Virginia
above
the
river
bottom
and
between
the
Thorn
Run
and
Montour
Run
valleys
,
and
"
Moon
Township
"
was
born
.

Settlement
times
(
0000-0000
)
The
settlers
Robert
Loudon
and
John
Vail
were
awarded
grants
to
a
total
of
.

Loudon
's
tract
was
situated
on
the
Coraopolis
Heights
adjacent
to
the
Meek
grant
.

Vail
's
grant
was
established
somewhere
between
the
current
Thorn
Run
and
Narrows
Run
valleys
(
although
this
location
is
open
to
some
interpretation
)
.

Three
other
early
grants
were
warranted
by
either
Virginia
or
Pennsylvania
land
speculators
.

The
boundaries
of
these
land
tracts
are
hard
to
identify
,
but
historians
believe
that
they
encompassed
about
or
so
,
and
were
occupied
by
anonymous
squatters
.

while
the
history
is
not
known
,
scholars
believe
the
squatters
were
somehow
marginal
to
the
social
order
.

In
abandoning
their
lands
,
the
squatters
ceded
any
potential
claims
to
settlers
who
would
otherwise
improve
and/or
cultivate
the
land
.

As
the
00th
century
drew
to
a
close
,
abandoned
lands
were
taken
up
by
new
settlers
who
were
drawn
to
the
region
by
the
fertility
of
the
soil
.

This
round
of
pioneers
were
,
by
and
large
,
wealthier
than
their
predecessors
and
had
the
means
to
develop
the
broken
and
hilly
areas
into
plots
suitable
for
farming
.

At
this
time
Moon
Township
was
an
enormous
tract
of
land
-
possibly
.

The
sheer
difficulty
of
residents
to
perform
their
civic
duties
(
e.g.
,
report
to
assigned
polling
places
or
attend
jury
trials
)
made
it
necessary
for
local
governing
authorities
to
parcel
out
the
land
into
smaller
municipalities
.

So
in
0000
,
the
current
Fayette
Townships
were
portioned
off
from
Moon
Township
,
to
be
followed
by
Findlay
and
Crescent
townships
,
respectively
.

0000s
to
present
In
0000
,
the
federal
government
designed
and
built
a
housing
plan
known
as
Mooncrest
for
defense
workers
.

Mooncrest
residents
produced
armor
plates
,
munitions
and
ship
s
at
the
nearby
Dravo
Corp.
during
World
War
II
.

Operated
by
the
U.S.
Air
Force
after
0000
,
homes
were
sold
to
private
investors
in
the
mid-0000s
.

Moon
became
home
to
Pittsburgh
's
modern-day
airport
in
0000
,
replacing
the
Allegheny
County
Airport
as
the
main
terminal
for
the
region
.

The
area
developed
mainly
due
to
the
airport
.

Prior
to
this
time
,
the
western
hills
of
Allegheny
County
consisted
largely
of
rolling
farms
and
small
residential
developments
.

During
the
Cold
War
,
Moon
Township
was
the
location
of
Nike
Site
PI-00
,
which
was
a
battery
of
Nike
Ajax
and/or
Nike
Hercules
surface-to-air
missiles
,
used
by
US
armed
forces
for
high
–
and
medium-altitude
air
defense
.

The
former
missile
site
is
now
a
nature
preserve
.

Development
of
Pennsylvania
Route
00
(
now
Interstate
000
)
to
the
Pittsburgh
airport
,
plus
the
addition
of
the
Parkway
West
from
Pittsburgh
and
nearby
exits
of
Interstate
00
,
allowed
Moon
to
become
the
area
's
crossroads
for
transportation
via
air
and
road
.

In
0000
,
the
relocation
of
the
landside
terminal
of
the
Pittsburgh
International
Airport
to
nearby
Findlay
Township
resulted
in
a
loss
in
traffic
to
the
township
.

Moon
experienced
a
significant
loss
of
tax
revenues
but
has
since
rebounded
as
the
cargo
area
for
the
airport
.

A
majority
of
the
airport
's
runways
and
facilities
are
still
located
within
the
boundary
of
Moon
Township
.

The
township
is
home
to
the
Air
Force
Reserve
000th
Airlift
Wing
,
which
was
established
in
0000
.

Moon
is
also
home
to
the
000st
Air
Refueling
Wing
of
the
Pa.
.

Additionally
,
the
Army
has
its
00th
Regional
Readiness
Command
,
built
in
the
late
0000s
in
Moon
Township
.

Since
the
loss
of
the
airport
terminal
,
the
township
has
shifted
its
focus
from
airport
commerce
to
corporate
development
,
residences
and
university
hub
.

The
main
campus
of
Robert
Morris
University
is
also
located
within
the
township
.

Major
corporation
headquarters
like
Nova
Chemicals
,
FedEx
Ground
,
First
Health/Coventry
and
the
consumer
division
of
GlaxoSmithKline
are
located
in
Moon
.

Expansion
and
development
Growth
is
expected
to
continue
in
Moon
in
the
near
future
due
to
many
new
construction
projects
such
as
the
redevelopment
of
University
Boulevard
and
conversion
of
the
West
Hills
Shopping
Center
into
a
new
shopping
plaza
.

Ground
was
broken
in
late
0000
on
the
new
Cherrington
Parkway
extension
.

The
extension
,
anticipated
to
be
opened
in
early
0000
,
will
create
additional
shovel-ready
land
for
Class
A
office
space
,
for
corporate
development
.

As
a
result
of
Robert
Morris
University
,
the
college
feeds
much
of
the
economy
along
the
township
's
University
Boulevard
area
.

Several
new
businesses
have
opened
recently
,
including
the
new
DoubleTree
Hotel
and
restaurants
including
Primanti
's
.

A
new
Walgreens
has
been
completed
.

US
Airways
development
After
years
of
declining
its
operations
in
Moon
Township
,
US
Airways
announced
Feb.
00
,
0000
,
it
would
build
its
flight
operations
center
on
a
piece
of
land
adjacent
to
the
Pittsburgh
International
Airport
and
Business
Route
00
(
now
Interstate
000
Business
)
.

The
center
would
retain
000
high
paying
jobs
and
increase
it
by

for
a
total
of
000
jobs
.

West
Hills
Shopping
Center
The
West
Hills
Shopping
Center
,
once
the
heart
of
Moon
's
commercial
business
,
was
sold
to
Wal-Mart
for
$
0.0
million
and
announced
to
the
public
on
Jan.

,
0000
.

Wal-Mart
officials
announced
their
plans
to
build
a
supercenter
location
on
the
site
of
what
's
now
the
West
Hills
Shopping
Center
.

The
company
also
purchased
two
adjacent
parcels
of
land
along
Brodhead
Road
.

The
store
could
open
as
soon
as

University
Boulevard
On
the
morning
of
Aug.
00
,
0000
,
the
former
Beers
School
and
Narrows
Run
roads
became
known
as
University
Boulevard
,
a
move
that
helped
to
promote
the
township
as
the
home
of
Robert
Morris
University
.

The
new
road
name
also
depicts
the
township
's
efforts
to
re-emerge
as
a
business-dominant
community
.

Since
the
0000
renaming
,
township
officials
have
researched
various
zoning
ordinances
to
piece
together
Moon
's
main
business
corridor
.

not
only
on
the

's
lunar
name
but
also
on
Robert

University
and
the

An
affluent
suburb
of

nationally
for
its
excellent
school
district
.

Mt.

(
and
the
only

)
that
is
a
chapter
of
the
prestigious
Cum
Laude
Society
.

Established
in
0000
as
"
Mount
Lebanon
"
,
the
community
's
official
name
was
changed
to
"
Mt.
Lebanon
"
when
its
home
rule
charter
took
effect
in
0000
.

History
The
first
settlers
arrived
in
0000-0000
,
having
purchased
the
land
from
the
descendants
of
William
Penn
;
other
pioneers
soon
bought
land
from
the
state
government
.

In
0000
,
Mount
Lebanon
Township
was
incorporated
as
a
"
First
Class
Township
"
under
Pennsylvania
state
law
.

It
had
formerly
been
a
part
of
Scott
Township
,
which
in
turn
traces
its
origins
to
the
long-defunct
St.
Clair
Township
.

Mount
Lebanon
was
not
named
for
two
Cedar
of
Lebanon
trees
that
were
planted
in
0000
on
Washington
Road
near
the
top
of
Bower
Hill
Road
,
but
was
named
after
the
area
from
which
they
came
,
Mount
Lebanon
,
due
to
the
similarities
between
the
two
landscapes
.

Prior
to
the
incorporation
of
the
township
,
the
"
Mount
Lebanon
"
name
was
used
for
the
area
of
Upper
St.
Clair
Township
near
the
cedar
trees
.

In
the
0000s
,
a
post
office
located
near
the
transplanted
cedar
trees
was
named
"
Mount
Lebanon
"
.

Incorporators
of
neighboring
Dormont
Borough
initially
tried
to
use
the
"
Mount
Lebanon
"
name
in
0000
,
but
were
opposed
by
residents
of
the
future
Mount
Lebanon
Township
.

In
0000
,
Mount
Lebanon
became
the
first
First
Class
township
in
Pennsylvania
to
adopt
the
council-manager
form
of
government
and
has
had
an
appointed
manager
serving
as
the
chief
administrative
officer
since
that
time
.

Mount
Lebanon
was
a
farming
community
until
the
arrival
of
streetcar
lines
,
the
first
line
to
Pittsburgh
opening
on
July
0
,
0000
followed
by
a
second
in
0000
.

After
the
arrival
of
the
streetcar
lines
,
which
enabled
daily
commuting
to
and
from
Downtown
Pittsburgh
,
Mount
Lebanon
became
a
streetcar
suburb
,
with
the
first
real
estate
subdivision
being
laid
out
in
November
0000
.

Further
,
the
opening
of
the
Liberty
Tubes
in
0000
allowed
easy
automobile
access
to
Pittsburgh
.

Between
the
0000
and
0000
censuses
,
the
township
's
population
skyrocketed
from
0,000
to
00,000
.

Today

whose
Red

through
the
Mt.

And
as
of
the
census
of
0000
,
there
were
00,000
people
living
in
Mt.
Lebanon
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
electorate
approved
a
Home
Rule
Charter
,
which
took
effect
on
January
0
,
0000
;
as
such
,
the
community
is
no
longer
governed
under
the
provisions
of
the
Pennsylvania
Township
Code
.

Mount
Lebanon
became
one
of
the
first
municipalities
in
Pennsylvania
to
adopt
a
home
rule
charter
.

In
the
charter
,
the
official
name
of
the
municipality
became
Mt.
Lebanon
,
Pennsylvania
;
the
word
"
Mount
"

,
rental

prices
are
low
enough
for

North
Braddock
is
a
borough
in
Allegheny
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

North
Braddock
was
organized
from
a
part
of
Braddock
Township
in
0000
.

The
borough
prides
itself
in
being
the
"
Birth
Place
of
Steel
"
for
having
Andrew
Carnegie
's
Edgar
Thomson
Steel
Works
since
0000
.

North
Braddock
is
a
suburb
east
of
Pittsburgh
with
a
00-minute
travel
time
to
the
city
.

The
borough
is
in
the
Mon
Valley
along
the
Monongahela
River
and
is
bordered
by
the
boroughs
of
Braddock
,
Braddock
Hills
,
Chalfant
,
East
Pittsburgh
,
Forest
Hills
,
Swissvale
,
and
Wilkins
Township
.

North
Braddock
is
made
up
of
three
jurisdictional
voting
wards
which
are
often
used
to
describe
specific
areas
of
town
.

U.S.
Route
00
highway
passes
through
North
Braddock
before
reaching
the
George
Westinghouse
Bridge
to
East
Pittsburgh
.

The
Port
Authority
bus
line
passes
through
all
three
wards
and
provides
accessible
transportation
to
downtown
Pittsburgh
and
the
surrounding
region
.

As
of
the
0000
census
the
borough
population
was
0,000
,
a
huge
decline
from
its
0000
population
of
00,000
.

The
decline
is
due
largely
to
the
diminishing
steel
industry
in
the
Mon
Valley
,
specifically
the
Edgar
Thomson
Steel
Works
,
which
formerly
employed
many
residents
.

History
In
0000
a
Scottish
trader
named
John
Fraser
from
eastern
Pennsylvania
acquired
land
at
the
location
of
the
current
Edgar
Thomson
Steel
Works
from
Queen
Aliquippa
and
the
Lenape
people
.

Frazier
settled
his
family
on
the
location
,
and
in
0000
Christopher
Gist
and
General
George
Washington
met
with
Fraser
while
delivering
messages
from
Governor
Robert
Dinwiddie
of
Virginia
to
French
commanders
in
the
Pittsburgh
region
.

Dinwiddie
urged
the
French
commanders
to
withdraw
from
the
Pittsburgh
area
.

Fearing
that
a
conflict
was
on
the
horizon
,
Frazier
returned
to
Philadelphia
in
0000
.

In
0000
General
Edward
Braddock
and
British
troops
left
Virginia
and
used
Fraser
as
the
guide
with
General
Washington
as
the
aide
on
the
expedition
.

The
objective
of
the
expedition
was
to
expel
the
French
at
Fort
Duquesne
.

It
was
on
July
0
,
0000
,
when
the
British
troops
arrived
at
Frazier
's
cabin
to
be
met
with
gunfire
from
the
French
troops
.

During
the
battle
Braddock
was
wounded
,
dying
on
July
00
,
0000
,
in
nearby
Uniontown
.

The
area
where
Braddock
was
shot
became
known
as
Braddock
's
Field
.

Historical
markers
identify
the
site
on
present-day
Jones
Avenue
across
from
Benjamin
Fairless
School
.

During
the
late
00th
century
farming
was
prevalent
in
the
North
Braddock
area
with
the
nearby
Monongahela
River
used
for
trade
.

Whiskey
became
a
very
profitable
product
to
trade
,
especially
to
the
New
Orleans
area
.

In
0000
a
whiskey
tax
was
created
,
drawing
in
protest
over
0,000
settlers
from
western
Pennsylvania
to
the
North
Braddock
area
,
as
part
of
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
.

The
angry
settlers
would
not
disperse
easily
,
and
federal
soldiers
were
called
in
to
enforce
the
new
tax
.

The
British
commander
of
Fort
Pitt
,
Captain
Edmondstone
,
had
signed
a
grant
of
of
land
from
King
George
of
England
to
Peter
Rowletter
.

Once
the
French
and
Indian
War
was
over
,
Mr.
Rowletter
sold
the
land
to
a
judge
from
Pittsburgh
,
George
Wallace
,
who
bought
around
of
land
,
including
part
of
Braddock
's
Field
,
on
March
0
,
0000
.

Here
Wallace
built
a
mansion
as
his
summer
home
.

Later
the
Marquis
de
La
Fayette
visited
the
country
as
the
Guest
of
the
Nation
,
and
while
doing
so
he
stopped
by
Judge
Wallace
's
mansion
on
May
00
,
0000
.

After
Wallace
's
death
the
home
was
left
to
his
nephew
who
lost
the
property
to
a
sheriff
sale
.

The
Wallace
mansion
would
be
used
as
a
boarding
school
called
the
Edgeworth
Ladies
Seminary
during
the
0000s
.

In
0000
the
first
coal
mine
opened
between
the
hills
near
Sixth
Street
.

During
the
00th
century
the
railroad
industry
was
expanding
across
the
country
.

Andrew
Carnegie
,
with
the
increasing
demands
in
steel
for
the
railroad
,
began
to
build
his
first
steel
mill
in
0000
,
named
for
John
Edgar
Thomson
,
the
president
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

By
0000
the
demand
for
steel
for
the
railroad
had
decreased
,
and
the
construction
of
the
mill
was
halted
.

Good
news
came
though
when
Carnegie
secured
a
$
0
million
dollar
loan
and
finished
the
steel
mill
to
roll
its
first
steel
under
the
supervision
of
superintendent
William
R.
Jones
.

The
mill
would
go
on
to
expand
,
and
in
0000
the
first
blast
furnace
was
used
at
the
Edgar
Thomson
Steel
Works
.

During
0000
East
Pittsburgh
tried
to
annex
the
land
around
the
mill
of
North
Braddock
that
was
part
of
Braddock
Township
.

Residents
of
Shady
Park
village
(
0rd
ward
)
and
of
Wolftown
(
0st
ward
)
came
together
to
hold
meetings
on
stopping
East
Pittsburgh
from
annexing
the
land
near
the
mill
known
as
Braddock
's
Field
.

William
Yost
serving
as
North
Braddock
's
attorney
petitioned
the
Quarter
Sessions
of
Allegheny
County
that
Shady
Park
and
Wolftown
would
join
as
one
town
,
also
incorporating
Braddock
's
Field
.

During
the
meetings
000
of
000
property
owners
signed
an
agreement
helping
Judge
Kennedy
make
his
ruling
to
form
a
new
town
.

On
Monday
,
April
00
,
0000
,
North
Braddock
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

Judge
Kennedy
of
the
Quarter
Sessions
Court
of
Allegheny
County
made
the
ruling
and
ordered
the
decree
for
the
new
borough
.

The
first
election
of
officials
was
to
be
held
on
May
00
,
0000
.

The
winners
of
the
election
included

History
Sewickley
Heights
was
established
as
a
borough
in
0000
,
but
the
area
's
character
was
largely
established
with
the
move
of
the
Allegheny
Country
Club
from
Pittsburgh
to
its
Sewickley
Heights
location
in
0000
.

The
establishment
of
the
country
club
accelerated
the
settlement
of
the
area
as
a
haven
for
wealthy
Pittsburgh
residents
.

Many
estates
established
in
Sewickley
Heights
up
through
the
0000s
occupied
hundreds
of
acres
with
houses
of
immense
proportions
.

Among
the
grandest
estates
was
Thawmont
,
the
estate
of
banker
,
shipper
and
investor
William
Thaw
.

Thawmont
was
featured
in
a
0000
print
advertisement
of
the
United
States
Battery
Company
that
promoted
electric
lighting
for
country
homes
.

Other
notable
estates
included
the
Henry
Robinson
Rea
residence
,
Farmhill
,
and
B.F.
Jones
'
000-room
mansion
,
Fairacres
.

Many
of
the
grand
estates
in
Sewickley
Heights
began
to
fall
into
disrepair
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Many
of
the
original
massive
houses
were
demolished
and
the
lots
subdivided
.

Sewickley
Heights
preserved
the
country
character
of
the
borough
by
requiring
minimum
lot
sizes
of
,
though
many
homes
are
on
substantially
larger
parcels
.

Many
"
neighborhoods
"
of
Sewickley
Heights
are
named
after
the
original
estate
and
the
clusters
of
homes
on
the
estate
parcel
are
marked
by
unique
stone
fences
original
to
the
old
estate
.

In
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
several
parcels
of
land
were
donated
or
purchased
to
form
the
Sewickley
Heights
Borough
Park

History
Guyasuta
and
the
Seneca
Indians
The
borough
of
Sharpsburg
is
located
along
the
Allegheny
River
just
over
outside
of
downtown
Pittsburgh
.

Sharpsburg
has
a
rich
history
dating
back
to
the
00th
century
when
the
Seneca
Indians
settled
into
the
area
.

One
Seneca
in
particular
,
Guyasuta
,
has
a
special
connection
to
the
community
.

Guyasuta
was
a
strong
warrior
and
skilled
hunter
.

He
was
chosen
by
George
Washington
to
be
a
hunter
guide
with
his
party
in
0000
.

When
the
two
met
again
in
Ohio
00
years
later
,
General
Washington
greeted
him
with
warmth
and
affection
.

In
0000
,
Guyasuta
was
involved
in
a
bitter
battle
at
Grant
's
Hill
,
where
the
Allegheny
County
Courthouse
stands
today
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
Guyasuta
sought
peace
with
the
British
Army
.

Guyasuta
's
peace
efforts
culminated
in
a
peace
treaty
,
in
which
the
government
received
a
tract
of
land
in
what
is
now
western
Pennsylvania
.

James
O'Hara
,
who
had
purchased
a
portion
of
the
river
land
,
donated
a
small
portion
of
it
,
where
Sharpsburg
is
today
,
to
Guyasuta
.

James
Sharp
and
the
initial
settlement
In
0000
,
a
man
named
James
Sharp
rode
into
this
area
and
purchased
of
land
,
building
a
log
cabin
for
his
wife
.

Opening
the
land
to
settlers
,
Sharp
built
a
school
and
church
while
continuing
to
donate
his
land
for
the
growing
needs
of
the
community
.

On
December
00
,
0000
,
the
borough
applied
for
incorporation
,
and
received
its
charter
March
00
,
0000
.

According
to
the
Sharpsburg
town
web
site
,
incorporation
was
March
00
,
0000
.

Industry
Since
its
incorporation
,
Sharpsburg
became
an
industrial
town
,
manufacturing
iron
,
brick
and
glass
while
goods
were
transported
through
the
canal
that
bisected
the
borough
,
along
with
the
Allegheny
River
.

When
railroads
became
the
preferred
mode
of
transportation
for
that
time
,
Sharpsburg
continued
to
thrive
as
thousands
came
for
the
plethora
of
job
opportunities
available
.

H.
J.
Heinz
Company
One
of
the
most
well-known
industries
that
had
its
beginnings
in
Sharpsburg
was
the
H.
J.
Heinz
Company
.

The
Heinz
glass
works
in
Sharpsburg
once
manufactured
all
of
the
glassware
for
Heinz
products
.

In
0000
,
Heinz
began
crating
and
bottling
his
first
horseradish
in
the
kitchen
of
his
Sharpsburg
residence
.

This
house
is
the
place
where
it
all
began
.

Shortly
thereafter
,
the
house
became
Heinz
’s
first
factory
.

Although
he
moved
his
company
down
the
Allegheny
along
the
North
Shore
of
Pittsburgh
,
he
was
very
gracious
to
the
people
of
Sharpsburg
until
his
death
,
donating
gifts
to
the
community
that
was
his
family
home
for
many
years
.

One
of
these
included
the
life-sized
statue
of
Guyasuta
that
was
installed
at
the
intersection
of
Main
and
North
Canal
streets
.

The
statue
has
twice
been
hit
by
automobiles
—
the
first
occurrence
in
0000
and
the
second
occurrence
in
0000
.

Each
incident
resulted
in
the
destruction
and
subsequent
replacement
of
the
statue
.

A
town
divided
Less
than
a
century
ago
,
Sharpsburg
was
divided
into
two
sections
because
of
a
railroad
track
that
went
through
the
location
where
Kennedy
Park
currently
sits
.

There
were
two
fire
departments
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
tracks
.

There
were
two
schools
on
each
side
of
the
track
as
well
,
one
"
up
street
"
and
one
"
down
street
"
.

Once
the
railroad
tracks
were
n’t
used
anymore
,
the
railcars
sat
vacant
on
the
tracks
.

The
Junior
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
Sharpsburg
went
to
the
railroad
company
as
well
as
the
Heinz
family
to
try
to
change
something
about
this
.

The
Heinz
family
said
they
would
help
build
a
park
if
it
was
used
for
recreation
purposes
only
.

The
park
was
built
around
the
time
when
President
John
F.
Kennedy
was
assassinated
,
and
that
is
why
the
area
was
named
Kennedy
Park
.

Today
,
Sharpsburg
continues
to
boast
pride
of
its
industrial
past
while
looking
forward
to
the
opportunities
of
economic
growth
within
the
business
district
,
and
its
residents
enjoy
being
a
part
of
this
unique
riverfront
community
.

0
.

The
need
for
two
fire
companies
in
a
borough
of
Sharpsburg
's
size
was
necessitated
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
which
split
the
town
in
two
.

In
the
event
of
a
fire
during
which
a

Bishop
David
Zubik
of
the
Diocese
of
Pittsburgh
created
the
parish
in
0000
,
at
the
behest
of
the
parishioners
,
who
called
for
the
three
churches
to
form
one
parish
.

Saint
Juan
Diego
,
a
Native
American
from
Mexico
,
was
chosen
as

.

The
residents
of

St.
Clair
formed
their
township
to
ensure
better
government
service

could
be
obtained
by
separating
from
the
more
densely
populated
northern
part
of
the
township
.

Upper
St.
Clair
Township
was
further
subdivided
throughout

several
parts
of
the
original
township
separated
to
form
new
townships
and
boroughs
.

0000
,
Upper
St.
Clair
Township
adopted
a
home
rule
charter
that
took
effect
on
January
0
,
0000
,
and
is
no
longer
governed
by
the
Pennsylvania
Township
Code
.

The
Whiskey
Rebellion
of

had
roots
in
Upper
St.
Clair
.

Formed
as
a
volunteer
militia
company
in

by
residents
of
the
township
,
the
"
St.
Clair
Guards
"
later
became
Company
H
of
the
00nd
Pennsylvania
Volunteers
.

The
community
was
home
to
several
mines
beginning
in
the
late
00th
century
.

Freehold

Co.
built
the
first
major
residential
development
in
March
0000
along
Washington
Road
that
at
the
time
was
conveniently
close
to

Wall
is
a
borough
in
Allegheny
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Wall
is
located
at
the
site
of
a
farm
purchased
by
James
Walls
in
0000
.

The
property
,
on
the
south
bank
of
Turtle
Creek
,
was
passed
to
James
'
sons
Henry
and
John
Walls
,
who
lived
in
a
log
cabin
near
the
heart
of
present-day
Wall
.

A
station
on
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
opened
in
the
early
0000s
,
which
was
named
"
Walls
'
Station
"
in
honor
of
the
Walls
family
.

Eventually
,
the
name
of
the
station
and
the
town
that
grew
up
around
it
was
shortened
to
"
Wall
Station
"
.

Henry
and
John
Walls
sold
their
property
to
their
cousin
Francis
Walls
,
also
known
as
Frank
Wall
,
who
developed
the
property
around
the
station
.

Wall
got
its
name
after
this
Frank
Wall
,
whose
said
property
development
led
to
him
being
there
when
the
first
two
houses
went
up
in
the
region
.

The
town
around
Wall
Station
was
incorporated
in
0000
as
Wall
Borough
.

The
borough
grew
rapidly
during
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
because
a
freight
depot
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
located
at
Wall
.

The
population
and
economic
vitality
of
the
borough
declined
during
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
as
the
railroad
industry
was
eclipsed
by
the
airline
and
trucking
industries
.

featured
two
beloved

s
:
The

,
with
its

banked
turn-around
curve

the
Racing
Whippet

Whitehall
is
a
borough
in
Allegheny
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Whitehall
is
probably
named
after
Silas
D.
Prior
's
tavern
on
Brownsville
Road
,
which
was
renamed
White
Hall
in
the
0000s
.

The
building
is
still
in
existence
,
but
is
in
Brentwood
.

Another
possible
source
of
the
borough
's
name
is
that
the
area
,
which
used
to
be
located
within
the
township
of
Baldwin
,
was
known
as
Whitehall
Driving
Park
.

In
0000
,
residents
of
Baldwin
Township
's
fourth
,
fifth
,
sixth
and
seventh
wards
began
the
process
of
secession
.

A
petition
was
filed
on
October
00
,
0000
,
in
the
Quarterly
Sessions
of
Allegheny
County
,
with
0000
signatures
out
of
the
0000
freeholder
s
in
the
proposed
borough
.

In
response
to
this
,
Baldwin
Township
officials
called
an
emergency
meeting
to
file
a
petition
to
have
Baldwin
Township
incorporated
into
a
borough
,
as
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
secede
from
a
borough
than
from
a
township
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
Whitehall
separated
from
Baldwin
Township
to
become
an
independent
municipality
.

According
to
former
mayor
Edwin
F.
Brennan
,
residents
of
Whitehall
wanted
better
services
and
zoning
than
they
received
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
township
.

extreme
northwestern
portion

's
Landing
,
the
two

in
0000
–
00
,

German
and
English
background
,
other
ethnic
groups
would
arrive
in
the
early
00th
century
in
small
numbers
.

Other

industries
included
tile
block
and
clay
drain
pipe
manufacturing
,
aluminium
ladder
and
speciality
tool
and
die
production
,
limestone
mining
,

Aliquippa
is
a
city
in
Beaver
County
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Pennsylvania
;
it
is
within
the
Pittsburgh
metropolitan
area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Formerly
the
borough
of
Aliquippa
,
it
was
formally
named
a
city
in
0000
by
the
Aliquippa
Borough
Council
.

History
Aliquippa
was
founded
by
the
merger
of
three
towns
:
Aliquippa
,
Woodlawn
,
and
New
Sheffield
.

There
is
no
evidence
connecting
the
Seneca
Queen
Alliquippa
with
the
location
of
the
borough
.

This
was
one
of
several
Indian
names
selected
arbitrarily
by
the
Pittsburgh
and
Lake
Erie
Railroad
in
0000
for
stations
along
the
route
.

Aliquippa
is
best
known
as
the
location
of
a
productive
steel
mill
that
the
Jones
and
Laughlin
Steel
Company
constructed
there
along
the
Ohio
River
beginning
in
0000
.

Employment
at
the
facility
sustained
a
population
of
00,000
in
0000
.

The
mill
closed
during
the
collapse
of
the
steel
industry
during
the
0000s
.

This
major
economic
loss
alongside
suburbanization
caused
a
major
population
loss
through
the
end
of
the
00th
century
.

The
oldest
church
within
the
current
boundaries
of
Aliquippa
is
Mt.
Carmel
Presbyterian
Church
(
formerly
White
Oak
Flats
Presbyterian
Church
)
,
established
about
0000
in
the
New
Sheffield
region
on
Brodhead
Road
.

Many
of
the
city
's
businesses
have
left
since
the
closing
of
the
mill
.

This
has
left
the
area
economically
depressed
.

The
B.F.
Jones
Memorial
Library
is
a
proud
historical
landmark
of
the
community
.

Ambridge
is
a
borough
in
Beaver
County
in
Western
Pennsylvania
,
incorporated
in
0000
and
named
after
the
American
Bridge
Company
.

Ambridge
is
located
00
miles
(
00
km
)
northwest
of
Pittsburgh
,
alongside
the
Ohio
River
.

In

;
in

00,000
people
lived

,
and
in

,
00,000
people
resided
in
Ambridge
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Early
history
The
town
is
near
the
location
of
Legionville
,
the
training
camp
for
General
"
Mad
"
Anthony
Wayne
's
Legion
of
the
United
States
.

Wayne
's
was
the
first
attempt
to
provide
basic
training
for
regular
U.S.
Army
recruits
and
Legionville
was
the
first
facility
established
expressly
for
this
purpose
.

The
Harmony
Society
first
settled
the
area
in
the
early
00th
century
,
founding
the
village
of
"
Ökonomie
"
or
Economy
in
0000
.

Although
initially
successful
,
accumulating
significant
landholdings
,
the
sect
went
into
decline
.

By
the
end
of
the
00th
century
,
only
a
few
Harmonists
remained
.

The
Society
was
dissolved
and
its
vast
real
estate
holdings
sold
,
much
of
it
to
the
American
Bridge
Company
,
who
subsequently
enlarged
the
town
and
incorporated
it
as
Ambridge
in
0000
.

Industry
American
Bridge
attracted
thousands
of
immigrants
who
came
to
fulfill
their
dreams
of
work
,
freedom
,
and
peace
.

The
steel
mills
became
the
focal
point
of
the
town
.

Most
of
the
employees
were
relatives
of
relatives
and
the
small
town
grew
,
with
wards
separating
the
town
into
ethnic
sections
.

With
the
growth
of
the
steel
mills
,
Ambridge
became
a
worldwide
leader
in
steel
production
.

The
borough
became
known
for
bridge
building
,
metal
molding
,
and
the
manufacture
of
tubes
(
large
iron
pipes
)
.

During
World
War
II
,
the
American
Bridge
Company
fabricated
steel
for
the
building
of
LSTs
(
Landing
Ship
Tanks
)
.

The
steel
was
then
sent
by
rail
to
the
adjacent
American
Bridge
naval
shipyard
in
Leetsdale
,
PA
where
the
LSTs
were
built
.

The
area
was
also
home
to
several
other
steel
mills
like
Armco
,
the
pipe
mill
which
manufactured
oil
piping
,
and
A.M.
Byers
,
a
major
iron
and
tool
fabricator
.

Eventually
competition
by
foreign
steel
producers
began
to
cause
the
share
of
the
steel
market
for
U.S.
manufacturers
to
dwindle
.

With
the
shift
of
steel
production
overseas
,
the
Ambridge
Bridge
Company
ended
operations
in
Ambridge
in
0000
.

The
legacy
of
American
Bridge
can
be
seen
today
from
coast
to
coast
,
from
the
Golden
Gate
Bridge
in
San
Francisco
to
the
Brooklyn
Bridge
in
New
York
.

Current
day
Current
Mayor
of
Ambridge
,
as
of
0000
is
Richie
D'Ambrosio
.

Even
though
the
steel
mills
no
longer
dominate
the
landscape
,
Ambridge
remains
the
home
of
Old
Economy
Village
,
a
National
Historic
Landmark
administered
by
the
Pennsylvania
Historical
and
Museum
Commission
.

The
site
interprets
the
Harmony
Society
,
one
of
America
's
most
successful
00th
century
Christian
communal
societies
.

Old
Economy
Village
also
provides
public
education
and
preservation
of
the
Society
's
unique
material
culture
.

Founded
by
George
Rapp
,
it
was
the
third
and
final
location
of
the
Harmonites
.

Established
in
0000
,
Old
Economy
-
known
to
the
Harmonites
as
"
Ökonomie
"
-
was
founded
upon
German
Pietism
,
which
called
for
a
higher
level
of
purity
within
Christianity
.

Soon
the
Harmonites
were
not
only
known
for
their
piety
,
but
also
for
their
production
of
wool
,
cotton
,
and
silk
.

As
a
pioneer
in
the
American
silk
industry
,
Economy
became
known
as
the
American

center
in

Beaver
is
a
borough
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Beaver
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
,
at
the
confluence
of
the
Beaver
and
Ohio
Rivers
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
borough
population
was
0,000
,
having
dropped
from
0,000
in

is

City
USA
community
.

Robert
Linn
was
the
mayor
of
Beaver
for
00
years
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
making
him
the
longest
serving
mayor
in
the
United
States
.

The
borough
was
the
home
of
influential
U.
S.
Senator
"
Boss
"
Quay
.

History
The
area
around
Beaver
was
originally
home
to
the
Shawnee
tribe
.

Later
,
the
Mingo
,
Lenape
,
and
other
displaced
groups
moved
into
the
area
.

The
area
was
part
of
the
Ohio
Country
that
was
in
dispute
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

Beaver
became
the
site
of
Fort
McIntosh
,
a
Revolutionary
War
era
Patriot
frontier
fort
.

After
the
war
,
the
fort
was
the
home
of
the
First
American
Regiment
,
the
oldest
active
unit
in
the
US
Army
.

The
fort
was
abandoned
in
0000
and
razed
a
short
time
later
.

By
then
,
the
frontier
had
moved
westward
and
there
was
no
further
need
for
a
permanent
garrison
to
protect
the
area
.

The
town
was
laid
out
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
it
became
the
county
seat
of
the
newly
formed
Beaver
County
.

The
first
county
court
was
established
in
the
town
in
0000
.

The
town
's
growth
was
steady
until
0000
when
the
arrival
of
the
Pittsburgh
and
Lake
Erie
Railroad
caused
a
major
growth
spurt
.

In
February
0000
a
massive
flood
caused
extensive
damage
.

In
0000
,
an
archeological
excavation
was
conducted
at
the
site
of
Fort
McIntosh
.

In
late
0000
,
local
officials
proposed
the
consolidation
of
Beaver
with
Brighton
Township
.

According
to
a
report
by
the
Governor
's
Center
for
Local
Government
Services
,
the
two
municipalities
would
possibly
derive
a
significant
financial
benefit
from
uniting
.

Also
being
considered
was
the
type
of
combination
:
either
merger
,
in
which
one
of
the
municipalities
would
be
annexed
by
the
other
,
or
consolidation
,
in
which
the
two
would
become
a
single
new
municipality
under
a
new
name
.

Any
union
would
have
required
voter
approval
.

History
Although
Center
Township
is
new
among
the
family
of
communities
making
up
Beaver
County
,
her
traditions
go
back
to
the
earliest
period
of
Ohio
Valley
History
.

Prior
to
colonial
explorers
,
native
Indians
traveled
the
"
Glade
Path
"
,
an
important
trail
crossing
the
future
township
North
to
South
.

One
family
of
settlers
in
Beaver
Valley
,
the
Bakers
,
made
their
home
in
0000
in
the
hills
above
Raccoon
Creek
near
what
is
now
Pleasant
Drive
in
Center
Township
.

At
that
time
,
all
lands
South
of
the
Ohio
had
been
claimed
by
Virginia
,
with
the
seat
of
Government
at
Pittsburgh
.

During
the
course
of
the
Revolutionary
War
,
Fort
McIntosh
was
constructed
at
Beaver
to
aid
settlers
in
defense
against
the
Indians
and
the
British
at
Detroit
.

Supplies
were
brought
from
Pittsburgh
along
the
old
Indian
path
.

The
trace
was
renamed
Brodhead
's
Road
,
after
the
Commander
of
Fort
McIntosh
.

When
Beaver
County
was
formed
in
0000
,
three
Townships
were
created
on
the
Southside
:
Hanover
,
First
Moon
and
Second
Moon
.

Later
(
in
0000
)
the
area
was
reorganized
into
four
Townships
.

One
of
these
was
Moon
,
the
parent
of
Center
.

Over
the
years
,
other
communities
were
formed
from
Moon
:
Raccoon
Township
in
0000
,
Phillipsburg
Borough
in
0000
(
now
Monaca
)
,
and
Potter
Township
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
a
serious
dispute
among
Moon
Township
residents
split
the
Township
,
separating
the
heavily
populated
suburban
section
in
the
North
from
the
much
larger
sparsely
populated
region
in
the
South
and
West
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
after
a
second
election
,
the
court
decreed
that
the
larger
Southern
section
be
known
as
Center
Township
.

Eighteen
years
later
,
the
remaining
portion
of
Moon
in
the
north
was
annexed
by
Monaca
,
becoming
that
Borough
's
Fourth
and
Fifth
Wards
(
Monaca
Heights
and
Colona
Heights
)
.

Today
,
Center
can
take
her
place
among
the
larger
and
most
progressive
communities
in
Beaver
County
as
new
housing
plans
develop
around
the
township
.

In
early
November
0000
,
the
largest
hepatitis
A
outbreak
in
American
history
occurred
due
to
contaminated
green
onions
at
the
defunct
Chi-Chi
's
Mexican
restaurant
in
the
Beaver
Valley
Mall
in
Center
Township
.

There
were
at
least
000
confirmed
cases
,
and
four
deaths
.

Center
Township
borders
portions
of
the
borough
of
Monaca
,
city
of
Aliquippa
,
Hopewell
Twp
,
Potter
Twp
,
and
Raccoon
Twp
.

Since
the
township
does
not
have
a
mailing
center
all
the
residents
of
Center
Township
have
either
a
Monaca
or
Aliquippa
mailing
address

Freedom
is
a
borough
in
Beaver
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
,
along
the
Ohio
River
northwest
of
Pittsburgh
.

In
the
early
years
of
the
twentieth
century
,
the
chief
industries
were
the
production
of
oil
,
caskets
,
and
monuments
.

In
0000
,
0,000
people
lived
in
Freedom
;
in
0000
,
0,000
people
lived
there
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
In
0000
,
the
Harmony
Society
returned
to
Pennsylvania
,
from
Indiana
.

The
society
settled
in
what
is
now
Ambridge
,
Pennsylvania
,
five
miles
(
0
km
)
up
the
Ohio
River
.

One
of
the
reasons
the
society
left
Indiana
was
because
of
harassment
for
their
abolitionist
activities
.

Their
settlement
was
in
Beaver
County
along
the
Ohio
River
.

There
they
founded
"
Ökonomie
,
"
now
better
known
as
Old
Economy
Village
.

Here
the
Society
gained
worldwide
recognition
for
its
religious
devotion
and
economic
prosperity
.

The
Harmonites
were
abolitionists
,
and
began
placing
signs
along
the
Ohio
River
with
one
word
,
"
FREEDOM
"
.

The
Harmonites
selected
this
location
because
the
river
curves
at
this
point
.

The
river
is
actually
flowing
North
,
so
runaway
slaves
from
the
South
would
be
traveling
up
the
river
.

The
FREEDOM
sign
on
the
river
bank
was
to
let
runaway
slaves
know
that
they
had
reached
freedom
(
and
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
)
.

If
the
runaway
slaves
were
still
in
Illinois
,
Indiana
,
or
Ohio
,
then
slave
hunters
from
Kentucky
or
Virginia
could
legally
cross
the
river
and
capture
them
.

Once
in
Pennsylvania
,
the
slaves
were
free
.

The
area
of
present
day
Freedom
,
Pennsylvania
,
began
to
be
called
"
Freedom
"
on
maps
of
the
Ohio
River
used
by
the
steam
boat
navigators
.

Establishment
The

by

steamboat
building
business
.

They
purchased
about
of
land
for
$
0,000.00
from
General
Abner
Lacock
.

The
original
village
was
surveyed
and
plotted
by
Simon
Meredith
.

All
of
the
lots
,
streets
and
alleys
were
located
with
special
preference
to
the
steam-boat
building
business
,
the
only
business
at
the
time
.

Later
,
an
additional
were
purchased
from
Captain
William
Vicary
for
$
0,000.00
.

property
in

house
;
today

the
house
remains

History
The
Borough
of
Monaca
has
a
history
dating
back
to
the
00th
century
.

A
grant
of
land
on
which
Monaca
now
stands
was
granted
by
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
by
patent
,
bearing
the
date
September
0
,
0000
,
to
Colonel
Ephraim
Blaine
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
who
served
in
the
Continental
Army
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
from
0000
to
0000
as
commissary-general
of
the
Northern
Department
,
and
paternal
great-grandfather
of
James
G.
Blaine
.

In
the
patent
,
this
tract
was
called
"
Appetite
.
"

On
August
0
,
0000
,
the
land
was
bought
by
Francis
Helvidi
(
or
Helveti
,
Helvedi
,
Helvety
)
,
described
as
a
Polish
nobleman
who
was
exiled
from
his
native
country
and
immigrated
to
America
.

Helvidi
,
who
may
have
been
the
first
white
settler
in
Monaca
,
bought
the
large
"
Appetite
"
tract
and
raised
sheep
on
it
,
but
his
venture
was
unsuccessful
.

Harmony
Society
leader
George
Rapp
,
one
of
Helveti
's
creditor
s
,
complained
in
0000
"
about
the
risk
Helvety
is
taking
with
the
sheep
,
"
and
in
0000
,
the
property
was
sold
at
Sheriff
's
sale
to
Rapp
.

In
0000
,
the
beginnings
of
a
town
began
when
Stephen
Phillips
and
John
Graham
purchased
the
property
and
established
their
"
extensive
boat
yards
"
there
.

It
was
first
named
for
Phillips
,
and
was
long
known
as
Phillipsburg
.

Phillips
and
Graham
built
numerous
steamboats
,
including
the
"
William
Penn
,
"
which
carried
the
Harmonites
from
their
second
settlement
in
New
Harmony
,
Indiana
,
to
Beaver
County
and
their
third
and
final
home
at
Economy
.

In
0000
,
Phillips
and
Graham
sold
the
entire
tract
of
land
to
seceders
from
the
Harmony
Society
at
Economy
,
and
moved
their
boat
yards
to
what
is
now
Freedom
.

The
seceders
from
the
Harmony
Society
were
led
by
Bernhard
Müller
,
known
as
Count
de
Leon
.

The
group
consisted
of
German
immigrants
who
formed
a
communal
religious
society
.

In
0000
,
after
leaving
Economy
,
with
about
000
former
Harmony
Society
members
,
Bernhard
Müller
and
his
followers
started
a
new
community
in
Phillipsburg
(
now
Monaca
)
with
the
money
they
obtained
in
the
settlement
with
the
Harmony
Society
.

Here
they
established
the
New
Philadelphian
Congregation
(
New
Philadelphia
Society
)
,
constructing
a
church
,
a
hotel
,
and
other
buildings
.

They
soon
renamed
this
community
Löwenburg
(
Lion
City
)
.

Perhaps
because
of
ongoing
litigation
,
and
other
financial
problems
,
Müller
's
group
decided
to
sell
their
communal
land
in
Pennsylvania
in
0000
.

Some
community
members
stayed
in
Monaca
,
while
others
followed
Müller
and
his
family
down
the
Ohio
River
on
a
flatboat
.

A
number
of
the
ones
who
followed
Müller
and
his
family
eventually
ended
up
at
the
Germantown
Colony
near
Minden
,
Louisiana
.

Many
stayed
in
Monaca
,
however
,
and
not
long
after
Müller
and
his
followers
left
,
a
new
religious
speaker
named
William
Keil
showed
up
in
the
area
in
the
early
0000s
.

Keil
was
able
to
attract
some
followers
who
were
former
Harmony
Society
/
New
Philadelphia
Society
members
,
and
his
group
eventually
ended
up
moving
away
and
settling
the
communal
town
of
Bethel
,
Missouri
in
0000
,
and
later
settled
the
town
of
Aurora
,
Oregon
in
0000
.

Nevertheless
,
a
number
of
former
Harmony
Society/New
Philadelphia
Society
members
stayed
in
Monaca
,
and
perhaps
some
of
their
descendants
live
in
the
area
to
this
day
.

In
0000
,
the
area
was
incorporated
as
the
"

.

In
