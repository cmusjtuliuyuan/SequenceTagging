Historical
Sketch
Hemingway
was
created
from
a
crossroads
community
named
Lamberts
in
0000
by
Dr.
W.
C.
Hemingway
,
in
an
effort
to
secure
a
depot
for
the
proposed
Seaboard
Air
Line
Railroad
,
which
was
to
run
from
Mullins
to
Andrews
.

Land
owned
by
Dr.
Hemingway
was
surveyed
and
the
lots
auction
ed
off
.

Subsequently
the
railroad
established
a
Hemingway
depot
,
and
the
post
office
name
was
changed
to
Hemingway
.

With
rail
access
,
Hemingway
grew
into
a
market
town
for
local
agricultural
products
.

Cotton
declined
after
0000
,
when
the
boll
weevil
arrived
,
but
was
already
being
replaced
by
flue
cured
tobacco
as
the
primary
money
crop
for
farmer
s.
Other
local
products
were
naval
stores
from
the
pine
forests
(
later
replaced
by
timbering
)
,
corn
,
soybean
s
,
wheat
,
and
vegetable
s.

History
The
original
town
was
laid
out
as
Williamsburg
by
the
Lords
Proprietors
in
colonial
times
.

But
a
lone
,
unusually
large
white
pine
was
found
along
the
Black
River
.

Since
tall
white
pines
were
ideal
for
use
as
masts
for
ships
,
King
George
claimed
it
.

The
king
's
broad
arrow
mark
was
put
upon
this
tree
to
prevent
anyone
else
from
cutting
it
.

It
was
never
cut
.

The
tree
that
the
town
gets
its
name
from
is
the
only
tree
of
King
George
’s
ever
found
in
the
south
.

Over
time
,
the
county
kept
the
name
Williamsburg
,
but
the
county
seat
became
known
as
The
King
's
Tree
,
giving
rise
to
its
modern
name
.

Clover
is
a
town
in
York
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United

,
metropolitan
area
.

As
of
0000
,
the
population
was
at
0,000
within
the
town
limits
.

Clover
is
twinned
with
the
Northern
Irish
town
of
Larne
on
County
Antrim
's
East
Coast
.

History
Clover
was
founded
just
north
of
an
earlier
settlement
,
New
Centre
,
which
had
waned
during
the
Civil
War
.

The
pivotal
American
Revolutionary
War
battle
of
Kings
Mountain
occurred
approximately
eight
miles
to
the
west
of
modern-day
Clover
,
on
October
0
,
0000
.

Prior
to
Clover
's
founding
,
Bethany
and
Bethel
,
communities
to
the
west
and
east
,
respectively
,
were
primary
population
centers
in
northern
York
District
,
with
well-established
Presbyterian
churches
,
post

as
a
railway
stop
in
0000
,
midway
between
Yorkville
,
and
modern-day
Gastonia
,
North
Carolina
,
when
the
first
railroad
tracks

laid
through
the
northern
section
of

Mountain
Railroad

,
the
Chester

Mountain
rights
of

.

By

,
new
,
narrow
gauge
railway
replaced
the
remnants
of
the
former
Kings
Mountain
line
,
and
the
following
year
the
tracks
were
extended
from
Yorkville
to
Gaston
County
,
North
Carolina
.

A
water
tank
for
the
railway
's
steam
locomotive
s
was
constructed
midway
between
Gastonia
and
Yorkville
.

According
to
lore
,
the
overflow
of
water
from
the
railway
's
water
tank
fertilized
a
patch
of
clover
,
and
the
stop
was
called
"
the
clover
patch
.
"

The
town
was
officially
incorporated
in
0000

It
later
became
the
home
of
several

mills
,
many
of
which
operated
until
after

system
technology
.

The
process
shifted
the
state
line
approximately
000
feet
southward
in
the
Lake
Wylie
area
,
resulting
in
several
properties
in
the
community

Point
Township
in
North
Carolina
—
including
one
property
where
the

line
falls
between
the
owner
's
house
and
his
back
deck
,
and
a
gas
station
and
convenience
store
whose
owner
has
noted
that
differences
in
gas
prices
and
retail
regulations
between
the
two
states
will
likely
force
him
out
of

History
Pre-colonization
Succeeding
cultures
of
indigenous
peoples
lived
in
the
Piedmont
for
thousands
of
years
.

The
historic
Catawba
Indian
Nation
,
a
traditionally
Siouan
-
speaking
tribe
,
was
here
at
the
time
of
European
encounter
.

Currently
the
only
tribe
in
South
Carolina
that
is
federally
recognized
,
its
members
live
near
Rock
Hill
.

Early
colonization
Although
some
European
settlers
had
already
arrived
in
the
Rock
Hill
area
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
Rock
Hill
did
not
really
start
to
become
an
actual
town
until
the
Charlotte
and
South
Carolina
Railroad
Company
made
the
decision
to
send
a
rail
line
through
the
area
.

Originally
,
the
railroad
had
hoped
to
build
a
station
in
the
nearby
village
of
Ebenezerville
which
was
squarely
between
Charlotte
,
North
Carolina
and
Columbia
,
South
Carolina
.

When
approached
,
however
,
the
locals
in
Ebenezerville
refused
to
have
the
railroad
run
through
their
village
since
they
considered
it
dirty
and
noisy
.

Instead
,
engineers
and
surveyors
decided
to
run
the
line
two
miles
away
by
a
local
landmark
.
"

According
to
some
accounts
,
the
engineers
marked
the
spot
on
the
map
and
named
it
"
rocky
hill
.
"

Some
of
Rock
Hill
's
early
founding
families
—
the
White
family
,
the
Black
family
,
and
the
Moores
—
believed
that
having
a
rail
depot
so
close
to
them
would
be
advantageous
,
so
they
decided
to
give
the
Columbia
and
Charlotte
Railroad
the
right
of
way
through
their
properties
.

As
the
three
the
largest
landowners
in
the
area
,
this
settled
the
matter
.

George
Pendleton
White
contracted
with
the
railroad
to
build
a
section
of
the
line
.

Construction
began
in
0000
.

The
first
passenger
train
arrived
on
March
00
,
0000
.

A
few
weeks
later
,
on
April
00
,
0000
,
the
first
Rock
Hill
Post
Office
opened
.

Now
that
Rock
Hill
had
a
name
,
a
railroad
station
,
and
a
post
office
,
it
began
to
draw
many
more
settlers
to
the
area
.

Captain
J.
H.
McGinnis
built
a
small
general
store
near
the
station
in
0000
or
0000
to
provide
supplies
for
the
construction
and
railroad
workers
.

Templeton
Black
,
who
had
leased
the
land
to
McGinnis
,
decided
to
devote
some
of
his
other
adjacent
land
to
building
a
larger
town
.

He
hired
a
local
surveyor
,
Squire
John
Roddey
,
to
organize
a
main
street
.

Templeton
Black
sold
his
first
plot
of
land
along
that
street
to
Ira
Ferguson
for
$
000
a
few
weeks
before
the
post
office
opened
;
other
businessmen
bought
plots
quickly
after
that
.

Rock
Hill
Academy
,
the
first
school
in
Rock
Hill
,
opened
in
September
0000
.

Despite
its
official
name
,
most
residents
referred
to
it
as
the
Pine
Grove
Academy
after
the
pine
grove
it
was
located
in
.

Ann
Hutchinson
White
,
wife
of
George
White
,
donated
the
land
to
the
school
after
her
husband
's
death
.

The
school
had
00
male
pupils
in
0000
;
a
school
for
girls
was
later
opened
in
the
same
place
.

Other
significant
facts
and
dates
During
the
American
Civil
War
Shortly
before
the
American
Civil
War
began
a
census
had
been
taken
of
the
population
in
York
County
,
where
Rock
Hill
is
located
.

Half
of
the
districts
00,000
residents
were
slaves
,
integral
to
local
cotton
production
.

The
0,000
white
males
in
the
county
formed
fourteen
infantry
companies
;
some
of
the
men
joined
cavalry
or
artillery
units
instead
.

By
the
end
of
the
war
,
000
of
these
men
were
dead
,
and
hundreds
more
were
wounded
.

Men
from
Rock
Hill
and
York
County
were
involved
in
many
of
the
major
Civil
War
battles
.

Due
to
its
position
on
the
railroad
,
Rock
Hill
became
a
transfer
point
for
Confederate
soldiers
and
supplies
moving
to
and
from
the
front
.

Since
there
was
no
local
hospital
,
townspeople
nursed
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
in
their
homes
.

Refugees
fleeing
the
coastal
blockade
or
General
Sherman
's
troops
also
came
to
Rock
Hill
.

Beginning
in
the
spring
of
0000
,
local
area
farmers
switched
from
cotton
to
corn
in
order
to
produce
more
food
.

Records
show
that
prices
in
Rock
Hill
changed
frequently
during
the
war
,
reflecting
both
shortages
and
the
inflation
of
the
Confederate
paper
money
.

Confederate
General
P.
G.
T.
Beauregard
set
up
a
temporary
headquarters
in
Rock
Hill
on
February
00
,
0000
.

He
ordered
the
roads
to
Charlotte
blocked
to
try
and
prevent
General
Sherman
from
reaching
the
city
;
Sherman
ultimately
went
in
a
different
direction
.

When
General
Lee
surrendered
at
the
Appomattox
Court
House
,
it
was
actually
a
future
Rock
Hill
resident
who
was
responsible
for
waving
the
white
flag
.

Captain
Robert
Moorman
Sims
,
a
farmer
from
Lancaster
County
,
was
sent
by
General
James
Longstreet
to
inform
Union
troops
that
the
Confederate
troops
wanted
a
truce
.

Post-Civil
War
The
Civil
War
changed
the
social
,
economic
,
and
political
situation
in
Rock
Hill
tremendously
,
as
it
did
elsewhere
in
the
South
.

Rock
Hill
grew
as
a
town
,
taking
in
war
refugees
,
widows
and
their
families
,
and
the
return
of
the
men
who
had
left
to
fight
the
war
.

The
formerly
wealthy
elite
sold
off
their
land
to
stay
afloat
financially
.

Town
life
began
to
become
more
important
than
rural
life
.

Most
of
the
merchants
in
Rock
Hill
around
0000
were
former
Confederate
soldiers
;
many
of
them
were
entrepreneurs
that
were
new
to
town
,
trying
to
start
over
.

In
0000
,
even
the
largest
stores
in
Rock
Hill
were
only
one-story
tall
with
no
sidewalks
on
the
roads
.

The
first
drug
store
in
Rock
Hill
opened
in
the
0000s
.

Incorporation
The
town
was
not
officially
incorporated
until
0000
,
on
the
third
try
.

The
first
attempt
to
get
Rock
Hill
incorporated
was
made
in
0000
.

A
petition
,
signed
by
major
landholders
and
businessmen
from
the
Rock
Hill
area
,
was
presented
to
the
General
Assembly
on
October
00
,
0000
.

No
action
on
the
matter
was
taken
by
the
General
Assembly
.

The
second
attempt
was
made
in
0000
.

In
their
petition
,
the
townspeople
claimed
that
Rock
Hill
had
over
000
residents
,
"
eleven
stores
,
two
churches
,
two
bars
,
two
hotels
,
two
carriage
shops
,
three
blacksmith
shops
,
three
shoe
shops
,
one
tannery
,
one
cabinet
shop
,
and
elementary
schools
for
white
girls
and
boys
.
"

The
petition
was
signed
by
00
men
,
mostly
relatively
newcomers
to
Rock
Hill
,
with
only
a
few
members
of
the
old
,
established
,
landed
families
who
had
been
in
the
area
for
decades
.

The
larger
landholders
were
opposed
to
the
petition
-
their
large
landholdings
would
have
meant
they
paid
most
of
the
taxes
if
Rock
Hill
was
officially
incorporated
.

They
filed
a
counter-proposal
which
claimed
that
there
were
only
000
residents
,
many
of
them
temporary
.

This
situation
was
a
strong
indication
of
the
changes
Rock
Hill
was
experiencing
as
it
transitioned
from
mostly
farms
to
a
business
community
.

Ultimately
,
the
state
legislature
did
not
act
on
either
petition
and
Rock
Hill
was
still
not
incorporated
.

The
successful
third
petition
was
made
in
0000
,
only
one
year
after
0000
's
failed
petition
.

This
time
there
were
00
signers
in
favor
of
incorporation
,
with
only
seven
opponents
.

The
opponents
collectively
owned
00
%
of
the
land
that
would
be
incorporated
into
Rock
Hill
if
the
petition
was
successful
.

They
were
unsuccessful
at
preventing
incorporation
this
time
;
Rock
Hill
was
officially
incorporated
on
February
00
,
0000
.

00th
century
Rock
Hill
celebrated
its
centennial
in
0000
and
its
sesquicentennial
in
0000
.

Four
unincorporated
communities
of
York
County
have
been
annexed
to
the
city
:
Boyd
Hill
in
the
late
0000s
,
Ebenezer
and
Mexico
in
the
0000s
,
and
Oakdale
in
the
0000s
.

Civil
Rights
Movement
Rock
Hill
was
the
setting
for
two
significant
events
in
the
civil
rights
movement
.

In
February
0000
,
nine
African-American
men
went
to
jail
at
the
York
County
prison
farm
after
staging
a
sit-in
at
a
segregated
McCrory
's
lunch
counter
in
downtown
Rock
Hill
.

Their
offense
was
reported
to
be
"
refusing
to
stop
singing
hymns
during
their
morning
devotions
.
"

The
event
gained
nationwide
attention
as
the
men
followed
an
untried
strategy
called
"
jail
,
no
bail
.
"

Rejecting
bail
was
a
way
to
lessen
the
huge
financial
burden
which
civil
rights
groups
were
facing
as
the
sit-in
movement
spread
across
the
South
.

As
their
actions
gained
widespread
national
news
coverage
,
the
tactic
was
adopted
by
other
civil
rights
groups
.

The
men
became
known
as
the
Friendship
Nine
because
eight
of
the
nine
men
were
students
at
Rock
Hill
's
Friendship
Junior
College
.

Later
in
0000
,
Rock
Hill
was
the
first
stop
in
the
Deep
South
for
a
group
of
00
Freedom
Riders
,
who
boarded
buses
in
Washington
,
DC
,
and
headed
South
to
test
the
0000
ruling
by
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
outlawing
racial
segregation
in
all
interstate
public
facilities
.

When
the
civil
rights
leader
John
Lewis
and
another
black
man
stepped
off
the
bus
at
Rock
Hill
,
they
were
beaten
by
a
white
mob
that
was
uncontrolled
by
police
.

The
event
drew
national
attention
.

In
0000
,
Lewis
,
by
then
a
US
Congressman
from
Georgia
,
returned
to
Rock
Hill
,
where
he
had
been
invited
as
a
speaker
at
Winthrop
University
and
was
given
the
key
to
the
city
.

On
January
00
,
0000
,
Rep.
Lewis
returned
to
Rock
Hill
again
and
spoke
at
the
city
's
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr.
holiday
observance
.

Mayor
Doug
Echols
officially
apologized
to
him
on
the
city
's
behalf
for
the
Freedom
Riders
'
treatment
in
the
city
.

Controversy
Rock
Hill
has
had
repeated
conflict
with
its
neighbors
.

In
0000
a
lawsuit
was
filed
against
the
city
by
its
county
seat
to
stop
a
rural
landfill
.

In
0000
and
0000
the
city
waste
,
proxy
contracted
with
Synagro
to
spread
treated
human
sewage
sludge
in
rural
areas
and
different
counties
were
met
with
resistance
and
complaints
.

Some
residents
have
questioned
the
city
's
ethics
and
threatened
lawsuit
s
over
the
practice
of
being
a
"
dumping
ground
"
for
Rock
Hill
's
waste
.

The
city
has
expressed
interest
in
Keck
and
Woods
"
waste
to
energy
"
plant
in
Cabarrus
County
,
North
Carolina
to
safely
dispose
of
sludge
.

Civitas
&
the
Gateway
The
symbols
of
the
city
are
the
four
Civitas
statues
,
erected
in
0000
at
the
Gateway
corridor
on
Dave
Lyle
Boulevard
.

Each
holds
a
disc
that
symbolizes
the
four
drivers
of
the
economy
in
the
city
(
Gears
of
Industry
,
Flames
of
Knowledge
,
Stars
of
Inspiration
,
and
Bolts
of
Energy
)
.

The
Civitas
statues
are
structures
made
of
bronze
and
created
by
the
New
York
sculptor
Audrey
Flack
.

These
were
originally
planned
to
be
placed
in
Uptown
Charlotte
,
but
were
offered
to
the
city
of
Rock
Hill
.

The
Civitas
complex
was
designed
as
a
female
version
of
Michelangelo
’s
David
.

The
sculptor
was
inspired
by
the
similarities
in
history
between
the
cities
of
Rock
Hill
and
Florence
,
Italy
.

At
the
time
of
the
commission
of
David
,
Florence
was
a
city
of
00,000
people
whose
once
vibrant
textile
industry
was
slowly
fading
;
the
competition
from
their
much
larger
neighbor
Rome
was
affecting
Florence
’s
growth
.

Rock
Hill
’s
size
and
textile
history
was
similar
to
Florence
's
when
the
Civitas
was
created
.

The
sculpture
reflects
the
spirit
of
Rock
Hill
’s
textile
heritage
in
the
clothing
and
hair
,
which
suggest
billowing
ribbons
of
material
.

That
material
transforms
into
wings
,
representing
the
textile
history
as
the
foundation
to
give
wings
to
the
city
for
growth
.

In
0000
,
a
fifth
Civitas
statue
by
Flack
was
placed
at
City
Hall
in
downtown
Rock
Hill

,
located
in

,
is
a
result
of
railroad
and
land
booms
in
the
0000s
.

The
early

gained
title
to
of
land
at
that
location
.

Huron
was
named
for

Tabor
(
pronounced
"
TAY
'
-
bur
"
)
is
a
town
in
Bon
Homme
County
,
South
Dakota
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the

census
.

History
The
first
Czech
immigrants
started
arriving
in
Dakota
Territory
in
0000
,
and
settled
west
of
Yankton
.

These
poor
people
from
Bohemia
came
to
America
with
hope
of
improving
their
living
conditions
and
attaining
a
better
future
.

The
majority
of
Czechs
settled
around
Tabor
.

Being
mostly
of
the
Catholic
faith
,
their
first
concern
was
to
organize
a
religious
community
.

Church
services
first
started
taking
place
in
0000
at
the
log
home
of
Vaclav
Janda
,
one
mile
south
of
Tabor
.

The
town
site
of
Tabor
was
purchased
from
Johanna
Kocer
on
April
00
,
0000
.

In
that
same
year
,
work
began
at
the
north
end
of
the
site
for
the
first
church
of
the
St.
Wenceslaus
parish
.

The
church
was
completed
in
0000
,
and
was
constructed
of
chalk
rock
cut
near
the
Missouri
River
south
of
Tabor
.

The
chalk
rock
church
was
quickly
outgrown
,
and
a
new
00
X
000
red
brick
church
was
built
in
0000
.

The
brick
church
still
serves
as
the
House
of
the
Lord
for
today
's
parishioners
.

Since
St.
Wenceslaus
Church
is
the
only
church
in
a
town
of
000
people
,
parish
activities
and
functions
are
social
highlights
for
the
community
.

History
Pioneer
Both
county
and
the
city
were
named
after
one
of
South
Dakota
's
pioneer
promoters
,
Wilmot
Wood
Brookings
(
0000
-
0000
)
.

Brookings
set
out
for
the
Dakota
Territory
in
June
0000
.

He
arrived
at
Sioux
Falls
on
August
00
,
0000
,
and
became
one
of
the
first
settlers
there
.

He
and
his
group
represented
the
Western
Town
Company
.

After
a
time
in
Sioux
Falls
,
Brookings
and
a
companion
set
out
for
the
Yankton
area
to
locate
a
town
in
an
area
that
was
soon
to
be
ceded
by
the
Native
Americans
.

This
trip
was
begun
in
January
0000
,
and
the
two
soon
encountered
a
blizzard
that
froze
Brookings
'
feet
which
both
had
to
be
amputated
.

He
rose
to
a
high
position
in
the
Territory
,
once
being
a
member
of
the
Squatter
Territorial
Legislature
and
later
being
elected
Squatter
Governor
.

Brookings
then
became
appointed
superintendent
of
a
road
that
was
to
be
built
from
the
Minnesota
state
line
west
to
the
Missouri
River
about
00
miles
north
of
Ft.
Pierre
.

It
was
during
the
construction
of
this
road
that
Brookings
came
into
contact
with
land
that
was
part
of
this
county
at
the
time
.

Because
of
his
drive
to
settle
the
Dakota
Territory
,
Brookings
County
and
city
were
named
for
a
spirited
pioneer
promoter
.

Wilmot
W.
Brookings
made
settlement
of
this
area
a
real
possibility
for
many
people
.

Medary
The
first
real
town
that
was
organized
in
Brookings
County
was
Medary
in
0000
.

Up
to
this
point
,
the
area
had
been
traveled
and
utilized
by
only
Native
Americans
,
with
a
few
indistinct
traces
left
showing
the
penetration
of
the
area
by
explorers
,
missionaries
,
trappers
,
and
traders
.

Along
with
Sioux
Falls
and
Flandreau
,
Medary
was
one
of
the
first
three
European
settlements
to
be
established
in
South
Dakota
.

The
first
actual
site
of
Medary
was
located
by
the
Dakota
Land
Company
out
of
Minnesota
which
was
led
by
Alpheus
G.
Fuller
and
Major
Franklin
J.
DeWitt
and
accompanied
by
engineer
Samuel
A.
Medary
,
Jr.
.

In
0000
,
the
men
put
up
quarters
in
preparation
to
live
out
the
winter
in
Medary
.

Many
other
settlers
moved
into
the
area
in
0000
.

But
in
the
spring
of
that
year
,
a
large
group
of
Yankton
and
Yanktonnia
Indians
drove
the
settlers
from
the
area
,
and
Medary
remained
nearly
abandoned
for
the
next
00
years
.

In
0000
,
a
group
of
00
Norwegian
pioneers
moved
west
into
the
Dakota
Territory
and
resettled
the
area
of
Medary
,
which
was
located
about
four
and
one
half
miles
south
of
present-day
Brookings
.

The
county
of
Brookings
was
formally
organized
in
Medary
in
the
cabin
of
Martin
Trygstad
on
July
0
,
0000
.

The
original
boundaries
of
the
county
extended
to
two
miles
south
of
Flandreau
,
until
the
territorial
legislature
relocated
the
boundaries
of
the
county
to
the
current
location
on
January
0
,
0000
.

Two
other
small
settlements
,
Oakwood
and
Fountain
,
appeared
in
the
Brookings
County
area
around
this
time
.

All
three
settlements
hoped
that
they
would
be
the
lucky
town
by
which
the
railroad
would
decide
to
lay
tracks
through
as
it
moved
westward
but
it
did
n't
go
through
Medary
so
it
became
a
ghost
town
.

Natives
The
first
people
to
inhabit
the
Brookings
area
were
the
Native
Americans
.

These
people
are
evidenced
by
mounds
found
around
the
Oakwood
Lakes
area
where
early
inhabitants
buried
their
dead
.

The
Mound
Builders
have
left
their
legacy
to
us
in
the
mounds
,
stone
hammers
,
and
stone
implements
that
later
Indians
and
white
settlers
found
as
they
traversed
the
area
.

Many
of
the
Sioux
Indians
and
branches
of
the
Sioux
tribe
made
the
area
their
home
,
also
.

Their
presence
has
been
accounted
by
white
settlers
.

The
first
white
men
assumed
to
have
ventured
into
the
Brookings
area
were
fur
traders
as
early
as
0000
.

However
,
the
first
white
man
definitely
known
to
have
trekked
the
Brookings
County
area
was
a
fur-trader
named
Joseph
LaFramboise
.

LaFramboise
established
a
trading
post
near
what
is
now
Flandreau
.

He
operated
the
trading
post
from
0000
to
0000
.

It
is
likely
that
during
the
time
of
his
operating
the
trading
post
that
LaFramboise
made
his
way
into
the
southeastern
part
of
Brookings
County
.

Railroad
As
it
turned
out
,
none
of
the
three
towns
were
chosen
to
be
passed
through
by
the
railroad
.

When
the
businessmen
of
Medary
and
Fountain
found
out
that
the
railroad
had
no
plans
of
laying
tracks
through
the
two
towns
,
they
began
a
push
to
find
a
central
location
.

In
a
sense
,
their
attitude
was
'
if
you
ca
n't
beat
'em
,
join
'em
!
'

Many
private
meetings
and
much
effort
on
the
part
of
the
men
of
Medary
and
Fountain
led
to
the
railroad
deciding
to
lay
its
tracks
through
what
would
become
the
city
of
Brookings
.

In
a
letter
sent
to
Chicago
on
September
00
,
0000
,
Land
Commissioner
Charles
E.
Simmons
communicated
the
layout
of
the
series
of
towns
in
Brookings
County
to
be
passed
through
by
the
railroad
.

These
towns
were
to
be
Aurora
,
Brookings
,
and
Volga
.

Many
merchants
of
Medary
and
Fountain
packed
up
their
businesses
and
belongings
and
moved
to
Brookings
,
which
was
surveyed
and
platted
on
October
0
and
0
,
0000
.

Fountain
ceased
to
exist
after
this
turn
of
events
,
while
Medary
and
Oakwood
continued
to
exist
for
a
while
but
eventually
faded
away
.

A
monument
still
stands
at
the
site
of
the
old
Medary
as
a
reminder
of
the
people
who
once
lived
there
.

The
railroad
crossed
the
Minnesota
state
line
and
into
Brookings
County
on
October
0
,
0000
.

With
tracks
being
built
at
about
one
mile
per
day
,
the
track
and
first
train
reached
Brookings
'
Main
Street
on
October
00
,
0000
.

The
railroad
station
was
opened
a
month
later
.

Belle
Fourche
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of

County
,
South

,
United
States
.

The
population
was

at

Belle
Fourche
is
the
site
of
the
geographic
center
of
the
fifty
United
States
.

(
Lebanon
,
Kansas
claims
the
title
for
the

contiguous
states
.
)

History
Belle
Fourche
(
French
for
"
beautiful
fork
"
)
was
named
by
French
explorers
when
this
area
was
owned
by
France
,
for
the
confluence
of
what
is
now
known
as
the
Belle
Fourche
and
Redwater
Rivers
and
the
Hay
Creek
.

Beaver
trappers
worked
these
rivers
until
the
mid-00th
century
,
and
Belle
Fourche
became
a
well
known
fur
trading
rendezvous
point
.

During
and
after
the
gold
rush
of
0000
,
farmers
and
ranchers
alike
settled
in
the
fertile
valleys
,
growing
food
for
the
miners
and
their
work
animals
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
open
plains
for
hundred
of
miles
in
all
directions
were
being
filled
by
huge
herds
of
Texas
and
Kansas
cattle
.

Towns
sprang
up
to
serve
the
ever-changing
needs
of
the
farmers
and
ranchers
.

In
0000
,
the
Marquis
de
Mores
,
a
French
nobleman
and
contemporary
of
Theodore
Roosevelt
,
established
a
stage
line
between
Medora
,
North
Dakota
and
Deadwood
,
South
Dakota
.

The
Belle
Fourche
way
station
included
a
stage
barn
and
a
saloon
.

Knowing
the
cattle
barons
and
the
railroad
would
need
a
point
at
which
to
load
the
herds
of
cattle
onto
freight
cars
for
shipment
to
the
packing
plants
in
the
midwest
,
Seth
Bullock
provided
a
solution
and
became
the
parent
,
in
effect
,
of
Belle
Fourche
,
the
city
.

After
serving
in
the
Montana
legislature
in
0000
–
0000
(
and
being
instrumental
in
the
establishment
of
a
National
Park
at
Yellowstone
)
,
he
had
come
to
the
Black
Hills
to
cash
in
selling
supplies
to
the
Deadwood
miners
,
arriving
August
0
,
0000
,
the
day
Wild
Bill
Hickok
was
murdered
.

During
the
next
00
years
,
Bullock
acquired
land
as
homesteaders
along
the
Belle
Fourche
River
"
proved
up
"
and
sold
out
.

When
the
railroad
came
to
the
Hills
and
refused
to
pay
the
prices
demanded
by
nearby
township
of
Minnesela
,
he
was
ready
.

Seth
offered
the
railroad
free
right-of-way
and
offered
to
build
the
terminal
if
the
railroad
would
locate
it
at
a
point
on
his
land
near
where
the
present
Belle
Fourche
Livestock
Exchange
exists
.

In
0000
,
the
first
train
load
of
cattle
headed
east
.

By
0000
,
Belle
Fourche
was
shipping
0000
carloads
of
cattle
per
month
in
the
peak
season
,
making
it
the
world
's
largest
livestock
shipping
point
.

This
was
the
start
of
the
agriculture
center
of
the
Tri-State
area
for
which
Belle
Fourche
would
become
known
.

After
winning
a
competition
with
Minnesela
over
the
railroad
which
now
goes
through
Belle
Fourche
,
Bullock
's
town
went
on
to
win
the
county
seat
in
the
election
of
0000
;
still
,
cowboys
rode
into
Minnesela
and
stole
the
county
books
.

Belle
Fourche
today
serves
a
large
trade
area
of
ranches
and
farms
.

The
wool
,
cattle
,
and
bentonite
industries
have
been
important
to
the
growth
of
Belle
Fourche
.

Belle
Fourche
serves
gateway
to
the
Northern
Black
Hills
.

&
Northwestern
Railroad
reactivated
part
of
a
line
it
had
constructed
to
Lake
Kampeska
.

The

was
named
after

,
the
hometown
of
brothers
John
E.
Kemp

P.
Kemp
,
some
of

Custer
is
a
city
in
Custer
County
,
South
Dakota
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Custer
County
.

History
Custer
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
oldest
town
established
by
European
Americans
in
the
Black
Hills
of
South
Dakota
and
Wyoming
.

The
site
of
one
of
the
major
encampments
of
the
Black
Hills
Expedition
led
by
of
Lt.
Colonel
)
George
Armstrong
Custer
's
0th
Cavalry
in
0000
,
which
made
the
first
public
discovery
of
gold
in
the
Black
Hills
.

For
thousands
of
years
,
the
Black
Hills
had
been
part
of
the
territory
of
varying
tribes
of
indigenous
peoples
.

They
were
within
historical
territory
of
the
Oglala
Sioux
at
the
time
of
United
States
encounter
,
and
within
the
Great
Sioux
Reservation
established
by
the
US
Treaty
of
Fort
Laramie
(
0000
)
.

Having
established
dominance
in
the
area
by
the
eighteenth
century
,
the
Oglala
Sioux
had
long
considered
the
Black
Hills
as
sacred
land
.

After
increasing
encroachment
by
European
Americans
and
violent
confrontations
,
the
US
government
forced
the
Sioux
to
cede
much
of
the
Black
Hills
in
0000
,
and
opened
the
land
for
individual
purchase
and
settlement
.

In
0000
trespassing
gold-boomers
named
their
settlement
Stonewall
(
after
the
Confederate
general
,
Stonewall
Jackson
)
,
but
it
was
renamed
for
Custer
.

Almost
abandoned
in
0000
after
word
of
the
much
larger
gold
strikes
in
Deadwood
Gulch
spread
,
Custer
later
became
an
established
city
.

Custer
has
had
a
smaller
population
and
been
less
wealthy
than
the
Northern
Hills
cities
of
Deadwood
and
Lead
.

In
addition
to
gold
,
Custer
and
other
cities
based
their
economies
on
the
extraction
of
industrial
minerals
,
which
are
still
important
to
the
regional
economy
.

Custer
claims
to
have
the
widest
Main
Street
in
the
United
States
.

The
city
made
the
street
wide
enough
in
the
nineteenth
century
for
a
team
of
oxen
pulling
a
wagon
to
turn
completely
around
.

Custer
annually
observes
a
"
Gold
Discovery
Days
"
celebration
and
festivities
over
the
last
full
weekend
of
July
.

This
heritage
tourism
event
celebrates
the
discovery
of
gold
by
the
Custer
expedition
in
nearby
French
Creek
and
the
subsequent
founding
of
the
town
.

History
“

received
its
name
from

Roslyn
,
which
was
a
post
office
and
trading
point
established
in
0000
.

H.H.
Russell
,
the
first

,
took
the
name
Roslyn
from
his
native
city
in
Scotland
,
”
although
a
Norwegian
name
would
have
been
more
appropriate
as
most
of

European
settlers
in
the
area
were
from
Norway
.

“
In
0000
,
the
Soo
Line
Railroad
(
Fairmount
and
Veblen
Railway
)
was
being
built
in
the
area

In
order
to
secure
the
line
for
the
community
,
settlers
adjoining
the
proposed
line
raised
$
00,000
.

The
coming
of
the
railroad
led
to
the
selection
of
a
new
town
site
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
New
Roslyn
was
plotted
and
Main
Street
was
established

A
model
rocket
,
also
known
as

is
a
small
rocket
designed
to
reach
low
altitudes
(
usually
to
around
000
–
000
m
(

for

and
recovered
by
a
variety
of
means
.

According
to
the
United

National
Association
of
Rocketry
(
NAR
)
Safety
Code
,
model
rockets
are
constructed
of
paper
,
wood
,
plastic
and
other
lightweight

The

also
provides
guidelines
for
motor
use
,
launch

selection
,
launch
methods
,
launcher
placement
,
recovery
system
design
and

and
more
.

Since
the
early
0000s
,
a
copy
of
the
Model
Rocket
Safety
Code
has
been
provided
with
most
model
rocket
kits
and
motors
.

Despite
its
inherent
association
with
extremely
flammable
substances
and
objects
with
a
pointed
tip
traveling
at
high
speeds
,
model
rocketry
historically
has
proven
to
be
a
very
safe
hobby
and
has
been
credited
as
a
significant
source
of
inspiration
for
children
who
eventually
become
scientist
s
and
engineer
s.
History
of
model
rocketry
In
the
early
thirteenth
century
the
Chinese
turned
black-powder
–
propelled
objects
,
formerly
only
used
for
entertainment
,
into
weapons
of
war
.

The
Chinese
‘
arrows
of
fire
’
were
fired
from
a
sort
of
catapult
launcher
.

The
black
powder
was
packed
in
a
closed
tube
that
had
a
hole
in
one
end
for
escaping
hot
gases
,
and
a
long
stick
as
an
elementary
stability
and
guidance
system
.

Refinements
in
rocket
design
were
made
over
the
next
few
hundred
years
,
at
least
on
paper
.

In
0000
a
Belgian
,
Jean
Beavie
,
described
and
sketched
the
important
idea
of
multistage
rockets
.

Multistaging
,
placing
two
or
more
pockets
of
fuel
in
line
and
firing
them
in
step
fashion
,
is
the
practical
answer
to
the
problem
of
escaping
earth
's
gravitational
attraction
.

While
there
were
many
small
rockets
produced
after
years
of
research
and
experimentation
,
the
first
modern
model
rocket
,
and
,
more
importantly
,
the
model
rocket
motor
,
was
designed
in
0000
by
Orville
Carlisle
,
a
licensed
pyrotechnics
expert
,
and
his
brother
Robert
,
a
model
airplane
enthusiast
.

They
originally
designed
the
motor
and
rocket
for
Robert
to
use
in
lectures
on
the
principles
of
rocket-powered
flight
.

But
then
Orville
read
articles
written
in
Popular
Mechanics
by
G.
Harry
Stine
about
the
safety
problems
associated
with
young
people
trying
to
make
their
own
rocket
engines
.

With
the
launch
of
Sputnik
,
many
young
people
were
trying
to
build
their
own
rocket
motors
,
often
with
tragic
results
.

Some
of
these
attempts
were
dramatized
in
the
fact-based
movie
October
Sky
.

The
Carlisles
realized
their
motor
design
could
be
marketed
and
provide
a
safe
outlet
for
a
new
hobby
.

They
sent
samples
to
Mr.
Stine
in
January
0000
.

Stine
,
a
range
safety
officer
at
White
Sands
Missile
Range
,
built
and
flew
the
models
,
and
then
devised
a
safety
handbook
for
the
activity
based
on
his
experience
at
the
range
.

The
first
American
model
rocket
company
was
Model
Missiles
Incorporated
(
MMI
)
,
in
Denver
,
Colorado
,
opened
by
Stine
and
others
.

Stine
had
model
rocket
engines
made
by
a
local
fireworks
company
recommended
by
Carlisle
,
but
reliability
and
delivery
problems
forced
Stine
to
approach
others
.

Stine
eventually
approached
Vernon
Estes
,
the
son
of
a
local
fireworks
maker
,
but
Model
Missiles
closed
due
to
unwise
business
decisions
.

Estes
founded
Estes
Industries
in
0000
in
Denver
,
Colorado
and
developed
a
high-speed
automated
machine
for
manufacturing
solid
model
rocket
motors
for
MMI
.

The
machine
,
nicknamed
"
Mabel
"
,
made
low-cost
motors
with
great
reliability
,
and
did
so
in
quantities
much
greater
than
Stine
needed
.

Stine
's
business
faltered
and
this
enabled
Estes
to
market
the
motors
separately
.

Subsequently
,
he
began
marketing
model
rocket
kits
in
0000
,
and
eventually
,
Estes
dominated
the
market
.

Estes
moved
his
company
to
Penrose
,
Colorado
in
0000
.

Estes
Industries
was
acquired
by
Damon
Industries
in
0000
.

It
continues
to
operate
in
Penrose
today
.

Competitors
like
Centuri
and
Cox
came
and
went
in
America
during
the
0000s
,
0000s
,
and
0000s
,
but
Estes
continued
to
control
the
American
market
,
offering
discounts
to
schools
and
clubs
like
Boy
Scouts
of
America
to
help
grow
the
hobby
.

In
recent
years
,
companies
like
Quest
Aerospace
have
taken
a
small
portion
of
the
market
,
but
Estes
continues
to
be
the
main
source
of
rockets
,
motors
,
and
launch
equipment
for
the
low
-
to
medium-power
rocketry
hobby
today
.

Estes
produces
and
sells
Black
Powder
Rocket
Motors
.

Since
the
advent
of
high-power
rocketry
,
which
began
in
the
mid-0000s
with
the
availability
of
G
-
through
J-class
motors
(
each
letter
designation
has
twice
the
energy
of
the
one
before
)
,
a
number
of
companies
have
shared
the
market
for
larger
and
more
powerful
rockets
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
Aerotech
Consumer
Aerospace
,
LOC/Precision
,
and
Public
Missiles
Limited
(
PML
)
had
taken
up
leadership
positions
,
while
a
host
of
engine
manufacturers
provided
ever
larger
motors
,
and
at
much
higher
costs
.

Companies
like
Aerotech
,
Vulcan
,
and
Kosdon
were
widely
popular
at
launches
during
this
time
as
high-power
rockets
routinely
broke
Mach
0
and
reached
heights
over
0,000
m
(
00,000
ft
)
.

In
a
span
of
about
five
years
,
the
largest
regularly
made
production
motors
available
reached
N
,
which
had
the
equivalent
power
of
over
0,000
D
engines
combined
,
and
could
lift
rockets
weighing
000
kg
(
000
lb
.
)

Custom
motor
builders
continue
to
operate
on
the
periphery
of
the
market
today
,
often
creating
propellants
that
produce
colored
flame
(
red
,
blue
,
and
green
being
common
)
,
black
smoke
and
sparking
combinations
,
as
well
as
occasionally
building
enormous
motors
of
P
,
Q
,
and
even
R
class
for
special
projects
such
as
extreme-altitude
attempts
over
00,000
m
(
00,000
ft
)
.

High-power
engine
reliability
was
a
significant
issue
in
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
,
with
catastrophic
engine
failures
occurring
relatively
frequently
(
est.
0
in
00
)
in
motors
of
L
class
or
higher
.

At
costs
exceeding
$
000
per
motor
,
the
need
to
find
a
cheaper
and
more
reliable
alternative
was
apparent
.

Reloadable
motor
designs
(
metal
sleeves
with
screwed-on
end
caps
and
filled
with
cast
propellant
slugs
)
were
introduced
by
Aerotech
and
became
very
popular
over
the
span
of
a
few
years
.

These
metal
containers
needed
only
to
be
cleaned
and
refilled
with
propellant
and
a
few
throw-away
components
after
each
launch
.

The
cost
of
a
"
reload
"
was
typically
half
of
a
comparable
single
use
motor
.

While
catastrophes
at
take-off
(
CATOs
)
still
occur
occasionally
with
reloadable
motors
(
mostly
due
to
poor
assembly
techniques
by
the
user
)
,
the
reliability
of
launches
has
risen
significantly
.

In
addition
,
it
is
possible
to
change
the
thrust
profile
of
reloadable
motors
by
selecting
different
propellant
designs
.

Since
thrust
is
proportional
to
burning
surface
area
,
propellant
slugs
can
be
shaped
to
produce
very
high
thrust
for
a
second
or
two
,
or
to
have
a
lower
thrust
that
continues
for
an
extended
time
.

Depending
on
the
weight
of
the
rocket
and
the
maximum
speed
threshold
of
the
airframe
and
fins
,
appropriate
motor
choices
can
be
used
to
maximize
performance
and
the
chance
of
successful
recovery
.

Aerotech
,
Pro-00
,
Rouse-Tech
,
Loki
and
others
have
standardized
around
a
set
of
common
reload
sizes
such
that
customers
have
great
flexibility
in
their
hardware
and
reload
selections
,
while
there
continues
to
be
an
avid
group
of
custom
engine
builders
who
create
unique
designs
and
occasionally
offer
them
for
sale
.

Precautions
and
Safety
Model
rocketry
is
a
safe
and
widespread
hobby
.

Individuals
such
as
G.
Harry
Stine
and
Vernon
Estes
helped
to
ensure
this
by
developing
and
publishing
the
NAR
Model
Rocket
Safety
Codes
and
by
commercially
producing
safe
,
professionally
designed
and
manufactured
model
rocket
motors
.

The
safety
code
is
a
list
of
guidelines
and
is
not
at
all
mandatory
for
those
practicing
model
rocketry
unless
one
is
a
member
of
the
National
Association
of
Rocketry
.

One
of
the
main
motivations
for
the
development
of
the
hobby
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
was
to
provide
young
people
the
opportunity
to
construct
flying
rocket
models
without
having
to
engage
in
dangerous
construction
of
motor
units
and
direct
handling
of
explosive
propellant
s.
The
NAR
and
the
TRA
successfully
sued
the
US
Bureau
of
Alcohol
,
Tobacco
,
Firearms
and
Explosives
(
BATFE
)
over
the
classification
of
Ammonium
Perchlorate
Composite
Propellant
(
APCP
)
,
the
most
commonly
used
propellant
in
high-power
rocket
motors
,
as
an
explosive
.

The
March
00
,
0000
decision
by
DC
District
court
judge
Reggie
Walton
removed
APCP
from
the
list
of
regulated
explosives
,
essentially
eliminating
BATFE
regulation
of
hobby
rocketry
.

Model
rocket
motors
Most
small
model
rocket
motors
are
single-use
engines
,
with
cardboard
bodies
and
lightweight
molded
ceramic
nozzles
,
ranging
in
impulse
class
from
fractional
A
to
G.
Model
rockets
generally
use
commercially
manufactured
black-powder
motors
.

These
motors
are
tested
and
certified
by
the
National
Association
of
Rocketry
,
the
Tripoli
Rocketry
Association
(
TRA
)
or
the
Canadian
Association
of
Rocketry
(
CAR
)
.

Black-powder
motors
come
in
impulse
ranges
from
0/0A
to
E
,
although
a
few
F
black-powder
motors
have
been
made
.

The
physically
largest
black-powder
model
rocket
motors
are
typically
E-class
,
for
black
powder
is
very
brittle
.

If
a
large
black-powder
motor
is
dropped
,
or
is
exposed
to
many
heating/cooling
cycles
(
for
example
,
in
a
closed
vehicle
exposed
to
high
heat
)
,
the
propellant
charge
may
develop
hairline
fractures
.

These
fractures
increase
the
surface
area
of
the
propellant
,
so
that
when
the
motor
is
ignited
,
the
propellant
burns
much
more
quickly
than
it
should
,
producing
greater
than
normal
internal
chamber
pressure
inside
the
engine
.

This
pressure
may
exceed
the
strength
of
the
paper
case
,
causing
the
motor
to
burst
.

A
bursting
motor
can
cause
damage
to
the
model
rocket
ranging
from
a
simple
ruptured
motor
tube
or
body
tube
to
the
violent
ejection
(
and
occasionally
ignition
)
of
the
recovery
system
.

Rocket
motors
with
power
ratings
higher
than
D
to
E
,
therefore
,
customarily
use
composite
propellant
s
made
of
ammonium
perchlorate
,
potassium
nitrate
,
aluminium
powder
,
and
a
rubbery
binder
substance
contained
in
a
hard
plastic
case
.

This
type
of
propellant
is
similar
to
that
used
in
the
solid
rocket
boosters
of
the
space
shuttle
and
is
not
as
fragile
as
black
powder
,
increasing
motor
reliability
and
resistance
to
fractures
in
the
propellant
.

These
motors
range
in
impulse
from
size
D
to
O.
Composite
motors
produce
more
impulse
per
unit
weight
(
specific
impulse
)
than
do
black-powder
motors
.

Reloadable
composite-propellant
motors
are
also
available
.

These
are
commercially
produced
motors
requiring
the
user
to
assemble
propellant
grains
,
o-ring
s
and
washer
s
(
to
contain
the
expanding
gases
)
,
delay
grains
and
ejection
charge
s
into
special
non-shattering
aluminum
motor
casings
with
screw-on
or
snap-in
ends
(
closures
)
.

The
advantage
of
a
reloadable
motor
is
the
cost
:
firstly
,
because
the
main
casing
is
reusable
,
reloads
cost
significantly
less
than
single-use
motors
of
the
same
impulse
.

Secondly
,
assembly
of
larger
composite
engines
is
labor-intensive
and
difficult
to
automate
;
off-loading
this
task
on
the
consumer
results
in
a
cost
savings
.

Reloadable
motors
are
available
from
D
through
O
class
.

Motors
are
electrically
ignited
with
an
electric
match
consisting
of
a
short
length
of
pyrogen
-
coated
nichrome
,
copper
,
or
aluminum
bridgewire
pushed
into
the
nozzle
and
held
in
place
with
flameproof
wadding
,
a
rubber
band
,
a
plastic
plug
or
masking
tape
.

On
top
of
the
propellant
is
a
tracking
delay
charge
,
which
produces
smoke
but
in
essence
no
thrust
,
as
the
rocket
slows
down
and
arcs
over
.

When
the
delay
charge
has
burned
through
,
it
ignites
an
ejection
charge
,
which
is
used
to
deploy
the
recovery
system
.

Performance
The
impulse
(
area
under
the
thrust-time
curve
)
of
a
model
motor
is
used
to
determine
its
class
.

Motors
are
divided
into
classes
from
0/0A
to
O
and
beyond
.

Black
powder
rocket
motors
are
only
commonly
produced
up
to
Class
E.
Each
classes
upper
limit
is
double
the
upper
limit
of
the
previous
classes
.

Low
power
rockets
only
use
motors
that
are
G
and
below
.

Rockets
using
motors
with
a
greater
impulse
are
considered
high
power
rockets
.

Figures
from
tests
of
Estes
rocket
motors
are
used
in
the
following
examples
of
rocket
motor
performance
.

For
miniature
black
powder
rocket
motors
(
00
mm
diameter
)
,
the
maximum
thrust
is
between
0
and
00
N
,
the
total
impulse
is
between
.0
and
0.0
Ns
,
and
the
burn
time
is
between
.00
and
0
second
.

For
Estes
‘
regular
size
’
rocket
motors
(
00
mm
diameter
)
,
there
are
three
classes
:
A
,
B
,
and
C.
The
A
class
00
mm
motors
have
a
maximum
thrust
between
0.0
and
0.00
N
,
a
total
impulse
between
0.0
and
0.0
Ns
,
and
a
burn
time
between
.0
and
.00
seconds
.

The
B
class
00
mm
motors
have
a
maximum
thrust
between
00.00
and
00.00
N
,
a
total
impulse
between
0.0
and
0.00
Ns
,
and
a
burn
time
between
.00
and
0
second
.

The
C
class
00mm
motors
have
a
maximum
thrust
from
00
–
00.00
N
,
a
total
impulse
between
0.0
and
0
Ns
,
and
a
burn
time
between
0.00
and
0
seconds
.

There
are
also
0
classes
included
in
Estes
large
(
00
mm
diameter
)
rocket
motors
:
C
,
D
,
and
E.
The
C
class
00
mm
motors
have
a
maximum
thrust
between
00.0
and
00.00
N
,
a
total
impulse
of
between
0.0
and
0
Ns
,
and
a
burn
time
between
.0
and
.00
seconds
.

The
D
class
00
mm
motors
have
a
maximum
thrust
between
00.0
and
00.0
N
,
a
total
impulse
between
00.0
and
00.00
Ns
,
and
a
burn
time
between
0.0
and
0.0
seconds
.

The
E
class
00
mm
motors
have
a
maximum
thrust
between
00.0
and
00.0
N
,
a
total
impulse
between
00.00
and
00.0
Ns
,
and
a
burn
time
between
0
and
0.0
seconds
.

Several
independent
sources
have
published
measurements
showing
that
Estes
model
rocket
engines
often
fail
to
meet
their
published
thrust
specifications
.

Motor
nomenclature
Model
rocket
motors
produced
by
companies
like
Estes
Industries
and
Quest
Aerospace
are
stamped
with
a
code
(
such
as
A00-0T
or
B0-0
)
that
indicates
several
things
about
the
motor
.

The
Quest
Micro
Maxx
engines
are
the
smallest
at
a
diameter
of
0mm
.

The
company
Apogee
Components
made
00.0
mm
micro
motors
,
but
those
were
discontinued
in
0000
.

Estes
manufactures
size
"
T
"
(
Tiny
)
motors
that
are
00
mm
in
diameter
by
00
mm
long
,
while
standard
A
,
B
and
C
motors
are
00
mm
in
diameter
by
00
mm
long
.

Larger
C
,
D
,
and
E
class
black-powder
motors
are
also
available
;
they
are
00
mm
in
diameter
and
either
00
(
C
and
D
motors
)
or
00
mm
long
(
E
motors
)
.

Some
motors
,
such
as
F
and
G
single-use
motors
,
are
00mm
in
diameter
.

High-power
motors
(
usually
reloadable
)
are
available
in
00mm
,
00mm
,
00mm
,
and
00mm
diameters
.

First
letter
The
letter
at
the
beginning
of
the
code
indicates
the
motor
's
total
impulse
range
(
commonly
measured
in
newton
-
seconds
)
.

Each
letter
in
successive
alphabetical
order
has
up
to
twice
the
impulse
of
the
letter
preceding
it
.

This
does
not
mean
that
a
given
"
C
"
motor
has
twice
the
total
impulse
of
a
given
"
B
"
motor
,
only
that
C
motors
are
in
the
0.00-00
.0
N-s
range
while
"
B
"
motors
are
in
the
0.00-0
.0
N-s
range
.

The
designations
"
¼
A
"
and
"
½
A
"
are
also
used
.

For
a
more
complete
discussion
of
the
letter
codes
,
see
Model
rocket
motor
classification
.

For
instance
,
a
B0-0
motor
from
Estes-Cox
Corporation
has
a
total
impulse
rating
of
0.0
N-s
.

A
C0-0
motor
from
Quest
Aerospace
has
a
total
impulse
of
0.0
N-s
.

First
number
The
number
that
comes
after
the
letter
indicates
the
motor
's
average
thrust
,
measured
in
newton
s.
A
higher
thrust
will
result
in
higher
liftoff
acceleration
,
and
can
be
used
to
launch
a
heavier
model
.

Within
the
same
letter
class
,
a
higher
average
thrust
also
implies
a
shorter
burn
time
(
e.g.
,
a
B0
motor
will
not
burn
as
long
as
-
but
will
have
more
initial
thrust
than
-
a
B0
)
.

Motors
within
the
same
letter
class
that
have
different
first
numbers
are
usually
for
rockets
with
different
weights
.

For
example
,
a
heavier
rocket
would
require
an
engine
with
more
initial
thrust
to
get
it
off
of
the
launch
pad
,
whereas
a
lighter
rocket
would
need
less
initial
thrust
and
would
sustain
a
longer
burn
,
reaching
higher
altitudes
.

Last
number
The
last
number
is
the
delay
in
seconds
between
the
end
of
the
thrust
phase
and
ignition
of
the
ejection
charge
.

Black
Powder
Motors
that
end
in
a
zero
have
no
delay
or
ejection
charge
.

Such
motors
are
typically
used
as
first-stage
motors
in
multistage
rocket
s
as
the
lack
of
delay
element
and
cap
permit
burning
material
to
burst
forward
and
ignite
an
upper-stage
motor
.

A
"
P
"
indicates
that
the
motor
is
"
plugged
"
.

In
this
case
,
there
is
no
ejection
charge
,
but
a
cap
is
in
place
.

A
plugged
motor
is
used
in
rockets
that
do
not
need
to
deploy
a
standard
recovery
system
such
as
small
rockets
that
tumble
or
R/C
glider
rockets
.

Plugged
motors
are
also
used
in
larger
rockets
,
where
electronic
altimeters
or
timers
are
used
to
trigger
the
deployment
of
the
recovery
system
.

Composite
motors
usually
have
a
letter
or
combination
of
letters
after
the
delay
length
,
indicating
which
of
the
manufacturer
's
different
propellant
formulations
is
used
in
that
particular
motor
.

Reloadable
motors
Reloadable
rocket
motors
are
specified
in
the
same
manner
as
single-use
model
rocket
motors
as
described
above
.

However
,
they
have
an
additional
designation
that
specifies
both
the
diameter
and
maximum
total
impulse
of
the
motor
casing
in
the
form
of
diameter/impulse
.

After
that
,
there
is
a
series
of
letters
indicating
the
propellant
type
.

However
,
not
all
companies
that
produce
reloadable
motor
systems
use
the
same
designations
for
their
motors
.

An
Aerotech
consumer
aerospace
reload
designed
for
a
00-millimeter-diameter
case
with
a
maximum
total
impulse
of
00
newton-seconds
carries
the
designation
00/00
in
addition
to
its
impulse
specification
.

However
,
Cesaroni
Technology
Incorporated
(
CTI
)
motors
use
a
different
designation
.

They
first
have
"
Pro
"
followed
by
a
number
representing
the
diameter
of
the
motor
in
milimeters
,
for
example
,
a
Pro00
motor
is
a
00mm
diameter
motor
.

After
this
,
there
is
a
new
string
of
characters
such
that
the
impulse
in
newton-second
s
is
first
,
followed
by
the
motor
classification
,
the
average
thrust
in
newton
s
,
followed
by
a
dash
,
and
the
delay
time
in
seconds
.

For
example
,
a
Pro00
000G000-00
is
a
G-motor
with
000
Ns
of
impulse
,
000
N
of
thrust
,
and
a
00
second
delay
.

Model
rocket
recovery
methods
Model
and
high-power
rockets
are
designed
to
be
safely
recovered
and
flown
repeatedly
.

The
most
common
recovery
methods
are
parachute
and
streamer
.

The
parachute
is
usually
blown
out
by
the
engine
's
ejection
charge
,
which
pops
off
the
nose
cone
.

The
parachute
is
attached
to
the
nose
cone
,
making
it
pull
the
parachute
out
and
make
a
soft
landing
.

Featherweight
recovery
The
simplest
approach
,
which
is
appropriate
only
for
the
tiniest
of
rockets
,
is
to
let
the
rocket
flutter
back
to
earth
after
ejecting
the
motor
.

This
is
slightly
different
from
tumble
recovery
,
which
relies
on
some
system
to
destabilize
the
rocket
to
prevent
it
from
entering
a
ballistic
trajectory
on
its
way
back
to
earth
.

Tumble
recovery
Another
simple
approach
appropriate
for
small
rockets
—
or
rockets
with
a
large
cross-sectional
area
—
is
to
have
the
rocket
tumble
back
to
earth
.

Any
rocket
that
will
enter
a
stable
,
ballistic
trajectory
as
it
falls
is
not
safe
to
use
with
tumble
recovery
.

To
prevent
this
,
some
such
rockets
use
the
ejection
charge
to
slide
the
engine
to
the
rear
of
the
rocket
,
moving
the
center
of
mass
behind
the
center
of
pressure
and
thus
making
the
rocket
unstable
.

Nose-blow
recovery
Another
very
simple
recovery
technique
,
used
in
very
early
models
in
the
0000s
and
occasionally
in
modern
examples
,
is
nose-blow
recovery
.

This
is
where
the
ejection
charge
of
the
motor
ejects
the
nose
cone
of
the
rocket
(
usually
attached
by
a
shock
cord
made
of
rubber
,
Kevlar
string
or
another
type
of
cord
)
from
the
body
tube
,
destroying
the
rocket
's
aerodynamic
profile
,
causing
highly
increased
drag
,
and
reducing
the
rocket
's
airspeed
to
a
safe
rate
for
landing
.

Nose-blow
recovery
is
generally
only
suitable
for
very
light
rockets
.

Parachute/Streamer
The
parachute/streamer
approach
is
used
most
often
in
small
model
rockets
,
but
can
be
used
with
larger
rocket
models
given
the
size
of
the
parachute
greatly
increases
with
the
size
of
the
rocket
.

It
uses
the
ejective
force
of
the
motor
to
deploy
,
or
push
out
,
the
parachute
or
streamer
.

The
parachute
is
attached
to
the
body
either
directly
,
by
means
of
a
ripcord
,
or
indirectly
,
when
it
is
attached
to
the
nose
cone
,
which
is
in
turn
attached
to
the
body
by
a
ripcord
.

Typically
,
a
ball
or
mass
of
fireproof
paper
or
material
is
inserted
into
the
body
before
the
parachute
or
streamer
.

This
allows
the
ejection
charge
to
propel
the
fire-proof
material
,
parachute
,
and
nose
cone
without
damaging
the
recovery
equipment
.

Air
resistance
slows
the
rocket
's
fall
,
ending
in
a
smooth
,
controlled
and
gentle
landing
.

Glide
recovery
In
glide
recovery
,
the
ejection
charge
either
deploys
an
airfoil
(
wing
)
or
separates
a
glider
from
the
motor
.

If
properly
trimmed
,
the
rocket/glider
will
enter
a
spiral
glide
and
return
safely
.

In
some
cases
,
radio-controlled
rocket
gliders
are
flown
back
to
the
earth
by
a
pilot
in
much
the
way
as
R/C
model
airplane
s
are
flown
.

Some
rockets
(
typically
long
thin
rockets
)
are
the
proper
proportions
to
safely
glide
to
Earth
tail-first
.

These
are
termed
'
backsliders
'
.

Helicopter
recovery
The
ejection
charge
,
through
one
of
several
methods
,
deploys
helicopter
-
style
blades
and
the
rocket
autorotates
back
to
earth
.

The
helicopter
recovery
usually
happens
when
the
engine
's
recoil
creates
pressure
,
making
the
nose
cone
pop
out
.

There
are
rubber
bands
connected
to
the
nosecone
and
three
or
more
blades
.

The
rubber
bands
pull
the
blades
out
and
they
provide
enough
drag
to
soften
the
landing
.

In
some
rockets
,
the
fins
are
used
as
the
blades
as
well
.

In
these
,
the
ejection
charge
pushes
a
tube
inside
that
has
tabs
sticking
out
of
the
rocket
that
hold
the
fins
during
launch
.

Then
the
tab
releases
the
rubber
band-pulled
fins
than
pivot
up
into
helicopter
position
.

Instrumentation
Aerial
photography
Cameras
and
video
cameras
can
be
launched
on
model
rockets
to
take
photographs
in-flight
.

Model
rockets
equipped
with
the
Astrocam
,
Snapshot
film
camera
or
the
Oracle
or
newer
Astrovision
digital
cameras
(
all
produced
by
Estes
)
,
or
with
homebuilt
equivalents
,
can
be
used
to
take
aerial
photograph
s.
These
aerial
photographs
can
be
taken
in
many
ways
.

Mechanized
timers
can
be
used
or
passive
methods
may
be
employed
,
such
as
strings
that
are
pulled
by
flaps
that
respond
to
wind
resistance
.

Microprocessor
controllers
can
also
be
used
.

However
,
the
rocket
's
speed
and
motion
can
lead
to
blurry
photographs
,
and
quickly
changing
lighting
conditions
as
the
rocket
points
from
ground
to
sky
can
have
an
impact
on
video
quality
.

Video
frames
can
also
be
stitched
together
to
create
panoramas
.

As
parachute
systems
can
be
prone
to
failure
or
malfunction
,
model
rocket
cameras
need
to
be
protected
from
impact
with
the
ground
.

There
are
also
rockets
that
record
short
digital
videos
.

There
are
two
widely
used
ones
used
on
the
market
,
both
produced
by
Estes
:
the
Astrovision
and
the
Oracle
.

The
Astrocam
shoots
0
(
advertised
as
00
,
and
shown
when
playing
the
video
,
but
in
real
life
0
)
seconds
of
video
,
and
can
also
take
three
consecutive
digital
still
images
in
flight
,
with
a
higher
resolution
than
the
video
.

It
takes
from
size
B-0-0
to
C-0-0
Engines
.

The
Oracle
is
a
more
costly
alternative
,
but
is
able
to
capture
all
or
most
of
its
flight
and
recovery
.

In
general
,
it
is
used
with
"
D
"
motors
.

The
Oracle
has
been
on
the
market
longer
than
the
Astrovision
,
and
has
a
better
general
reputation
.

However
,
"
keychain
cameras
"
are
also
widely
available
and
can
be
used
on
almost
any
rocket
without
significantly
increasing
drag
.

There
are
also
experimental
homemade
rockets
that
include
onboard
videocameras
,
with
two
methods
for
shooting
the
video
.

One
is
to
radio
the
signal
down
to
earth
,
like
in
the
BoosterVision
series
of
cameras
.

The
second
method
for
this
is
to
record
it
on
board
and
be
downloaded
after
recovery
,
the
method
employed
by
the
cameras
above
(
some
experimenters
use
the
Aiptek
PenCam
Mega
for
this
,
the
lowest
power
usable
with
this
method
is
a
C
or
D
Motor
)
.

Instrumentation
and
experimentation
Model
rockets
with
electronic
altimeter
s
can
report
and
or
record
electronic
data
such
as
maximum
speed
,
acceleration
,
and
altitude
.

Two
methods
of
determining
these
quantities
are
to
a
)
have
an
accelerometer
and
a
timer
and
work
backwards
from
the
acceleration
to
the
speed
and
then
to
the
height
and
b
)
to
have
a
barometer
on
board
with
a
timer
and
to
get
the
height
(
from
the
difference
of
the
pressure
on
the
ground
to
the
pressure
in
the
air
)
and
to
work
forwards
with
the
time
of
the
measurements
to
the
speed
and
acceleration
.

Rocket
modelers
often
experiment
with
rocket
sizes
,
shapes
,
payloads
,
multistage
rocket
s
,
and
recovery
methods
.

Some
rocketeers
build
scale
models
of
larger
rockets
,
space
launchers
,
or
missiles
.

High-power
rocketry
As
with
low-power
model
rockets
,
high-power
rockets
are
also
constructed
from
lightweight
materials
.

Unlike
model
rockets
,
high-power
rockets
often
require
stronger
materials
such
as
fiberglass
,
composite
material
s
,
and
aluminum
to
withstand
the
higher
stresses
during
flights
that
often
exceed
speeds
of
Mach
0
(
000
m/s
)
and
over
0,000
m
(
00,000
ft.
)
altitude
.

High-power
rockets
are
propelled
by
larger
motors
ranging
from
class
H
to
class
O
,
and/or
weigh
more
than
0,000
grams
at
liftoff
.

Their
motors
are
almost
always
reloadable
rather
than
single-use
in
order
to
reduce
cost
.

Recovery
and/or
multi-stage
ignition
may
be
initiated
by
small
on-board
computers
,
which
use
an
altimeter
or
accelerometer
for
detecting
when
to
ignite
engines
or
deploy
parachutes
.

High-power
model
rockets
can
carry
large
payloads
,
including
cameras
and
instrumentation
such
as
GPS
units
.

Differences
from
model
rocketry
A
high
power
rocket
must
meet
at
least
one
of
the
following
criteria

Germans
from
Russia
Foods
Several
food
items
are
sold
throughout
the
state
of
South
Dakota
that
are
derivative
of
the
Hosmer
people
’s
heritage
.

Three
main
staples
of
Hosmer
’s
Germans
from
Russia
heritage
are
Kuchen
,
German
Style
Noodles
,
and
German
Style
Sausage
.

Kuchen
,
pronounced
coo-gan
,

by
Judy
Weishaar
,
proprietor
of
Judy
’s
Salon
,
and
sold
at
Heier
’s
Grocery
in
Hosmer
.

The
Kuchen
made
in
Hosmer
is
most
similar
to
the
description
of
Käsekuchen
.

German
Style
Noodles
are
made
at
the
Hosmer
Noodle
Factory
,
located
on
Main
Street
Hosmer
,
and
have
been
enjoyed
from
as
far
away
as
South

in
a
Sunday

.

German
Style
Sausage
is
made
at
Heier
’s
Meat
Market
,
operated
by
Heier
brothers
,
and
sold
throughout
the
state
.

Even
though
many
Hosmer
locals
make
their
own
sausages
and
take
pride
in
it
,
Heier
’s
sausage
is
still
revered
by
most
.

Schools
Hosmer
was
home
to
the
Hosmer
Tigers
until
the
end
of
the
0000-0000
school
year
,
when
they
combined
with
the
Roscoe
Hornets
of
Roscoe
,
South
Dakota
,
to
make
Edmunds
Central
,
home
of
the
Raiders
.

The
Hosmer
school
was
then
used
for
some
of
the
Edmunds
Central
elementary
classes
.

The
school
in
Hosmer
is
now
closed
.

Due
to
the
state
's
open
enrollment
policy
,
parents
may
choose
to
send
their
children
where
they
wish
,
although
most
primary
and
secondary
students
living
in
the
Hosmer
school
district
have
continued
attending
Edmunds
Central
in
Roscoe
.

Economics
Hosmer
can
be
considered
a
farming
community
,
and
as
the
case
for
most
farming
communities
,
they
have
seen
a
decline
in
population
.

As
farms
grow
larger
,
populations
of
farming
communities
grow
smaller
.

The
decline
in
population
is
hard
on
all
of
Hosmer
's
businesses
.

Hosmer
’s
largest
single
employer
,
the
Hosmer
Nursing
Home
,
has
endured
years
of
tough
times
.

The
Hosmer
Nursing
Home
suffers
from
a
low
resident
attendance
and
a
low
employee
salary
,
even
though
it
offers
a
better
than
quality
treatment
of
its
residents
.

The
outstanding
care
of
the
residents
can
be
attributed
to
the
dedication
and
hard
work
of
the
employees
,
as
well
as
to
the
individual
attention
given
in
mind
to
all
resident
well
being
.

History
Cresbard
celebrated
its
centennial
in
0000
.

The
town
was
founded
in
0000
when
the
Minneapolis
&
St
Louis
Railway
completed
a
line
from
Watertown
,
South
Dakota
,
to
LeBeau
,
South
Dakota
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Missouri
River
.

It
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

The
name
is
an
amalgam
of
Cressey
and
Bard
,
the
names
of
two
local
families
.

In
its
early
years
,
it
served
as
a
grain
and
livestock
center
for
the
northern
tier
of
Faulk
County
,
South
Dakota
.

Cresbard
became
a
well
known
consolidated
school
district
by
the
0000s
serving
at
least
seven
smaller
communities
in
the
surrounding
area
.

The
school
's
marching
and
concert
band
won
national
recognition
in
the
0000s
and
boys
basketball
and
cross
country
teams
won
state
titles
.

The
railway
was
abandoned
by
0000
and
State
Highway
00
served
as
the
town
's
main
link
to
the
outside
world
.

Following
a
nationwide
population
upswing
after
World
War
II
the
agriculture-based
economy
of
the
area
began
to
show
a
decreasing
population
.

The
population
of
the
school
fell
from
a
high
of
000
in
the
00s
and
00s
to
less
than
000
students
by
the
late
0000s
.

Because
of
dwindling
high
school
population
(
00
at
last
count
[
0
]
)
citizens
of
Cresbard
spent
several
years
exploring
their
options
.

In
0000
the
town
's
total
population
fell
to
000
and
the
decision
was
made
to
redistrict
the
schools
.

The
high
school
[
0
]
closed
and
was
offered
for
sale
on
the
internet
the
following
year
at
a
price
calculated
to
attract
outside
business
.

It
was
purchased
to
serve
as
the
corporate
headquarters
of
Keenspot
Entertainment
by
Chris
Crosby
and
Chris
's
mother
Terri
,
Keenspot
's
co-owner
.

Keenspot
Entertainment
is
a
growing
publisher
of
more
than
00
online
comics
and
related
materials
including
a
number
of
Crosby
's
own
projects
such
as
the
pseudo-autobiographical
Superosity
which
briefly
was
set
in
a
fictionalized
Cresbard
during
the
story
arcs
"
Back
in
the
Green
"
[

and
"
South
Dakotan
Christmas
"
[
0
]
in
which
the
high
school
was
parodied
as
an
abandoned
mental
hospital
.

In
keeping
with
his
wacky
,
satirical
style
,
Crosby
's
comic
characters
fled
from
South
Dakota
following
a
fictionalized
version
of
the
Blizzard
of
November
00
–

,

[

.

As
of
0000
,
the
primary
non-agricultural
commercial
venture
in
the
town
of
Cresbard
and
surrounding
areas
is
services
related
to
the
recreational
hunting
of
pheasant
,
ducks
,
geese
,
deer
,
and
buffalo
[

.

Cresbard
is
also
the
home
of
an
hotel
and
restaurant
,
museum
,
auto
shop
,
oil
supply
company
,
insurance
agency
,
a

,
Senior

center
,
two
churches
(
one
Lutheran
Church
—
Missouri
Synod
and
one
Methodist
)
,
and
a
local
fire
and
rescue
.

It
is
surrounded
by
farmland
.

Among
the
businesses
that
closed
due
to
the
decrease
in
population
were
a
grocery
store
,
drug
store
,
hardware
store
,
small
movie
theater
,
laundromat
,
and
farm
implement
dealership
.

The
town
no
longer
operates
the
grain
elevator
or
lumberyard
[

.

The
services
these
businesses
represent
can
now
be
found
in
neighboring
towns
,
such
as
Aberdeen
,
South
Dakota
which
is
00
miles
away
.

Ruth
Wood
,
a
retired
school
teacher
and
farm
wife
characterizes
Cresbard
as
"
a
place
where
we
can
not
lie
about
our
age
,
our
background
or
our
school
pranks
.

There
will
always
be
someone
around
who
remembers
all
of
the
facts
(
or
will
supply
them
anyway
)
.

There
is
no
need
to
put
on
airs
or
pretense
.

association
with

College
,

and
to

been
able
to
read
the
Bible
before

.

He
had
00
younger
siblings
,
including

years
old
)
.

For
two

,
he
was
rector
of
the
Hopkins
Grammar
School
in
New
Haven
,
Connecticut
.

He
was
a
tutor
at
Yale
College
from
0000
to
0000
.

Licensed

preach
in
0000
,

sermons
and
the
stirring
war
songs
he
composed
,
the
most
famous

.

On
March
0
,
0000
,
Dwight
married
Mary
Woolsey
(

)
,
the
daughter
of
New
York
merchant
and
banker

–
0000
)
.

This
marriage
connected
him
to
some
of
New
York
's
wealthiest
and
most
influential
families
.

Woolsey
had
been
Dwight
's
father
's
Yale
classmate
,
roommate
,
and
intimate
friend
.

On
news
of
his
father

the
fall
of
0000
,
he
resigned
his
commission
and
returned
to

,
establishing
a
school
for
both
sexes
.

During
this
period
,
he
served
two
terms
in
the
Massachusetts
legislature
.

Career
Dwight
first
came
to
public
attention
with
his
Yale
College
"
Valedictory
Address
"
of
0000
,
in
which
he
described
Americans
as
having
a
unique
national
identity
as
a
new
"
people
,
who
have
the
same
religion
,
the
same
manners
,
the
same
interests
,
the
same
language
,
and
the
same
essential
forms
and
principles
of
civic
government
.
"

Declining
calls
from
churches
in
Beverly
and
Charlestown
,
he
chose
instead
to
settle
from
0000
until
0000
as
minister
in
"
Greenfield
Hill
,
"
a
congregational
church
in
Fairfield
,
Connecticut
.

There
he
established
an
academy
,
which
at
once
acquired
a
high
reputation
,
and
attracted
pupils
from
all
parts
of
the
Union
.

Dwight
was
an
innovative
and
inspiring
teacher
,
preferring
moral
suasion
over
the
corporal
punishment
favored
by
most
schoolmasters
of
the
day
.

He
received
honorary
degrees
from
Princeton
University
in
0000
and
Harvard
University
in
0000
.

In
0000
Dwight
preached
a
sermon
to
the
General
Association
of
Connecticut
entitled
a
"
Discourse
on
the
Genuineness
and
Authenticity
of
the
New
Testament
"
which
when
printed
the
next
year
became
an
important
tract
defending
the
orthodox
faith
against
Deists
and
other
skeptics
.

Dwight
was
the
leader
of
the
evangelical
New
Divinity
faction
of
Congregationalism
—
a
group
closely
identified
with
Connecticut
's
emerging
commercial
elite
.

Although
fiercely
opposed
by
religious
moderates
—
most
notably
Yale
president
Ezra
Stiles
—
he
was
elected
to
the
presidency
of
Yale
on
Stiles
's
death
in
0000
.

Shortly
afterwards
,
he
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
the
Connecticut
Society
of
the
Cincinnati
.

His
ability
as
a
teacher
,
and
his
talents
as
a
religious
and
political
leader
,
soon
made
the
college
the
largest
institution
of
higher
education
in
North
America
.

Dwight
had
a
genius
for
recognizing
able
protégés
—
among
them
Lyman
Beecher
,
Nathaniel
W.
Taylor
,
and
Leonard
Bacon
,
all
of
whom
would
become
major
religious
leaders
and
theological
innovators
in
the
ante
bellum
decades
.

During
troubled
times
at
Yale
University
,
president
Timothy
Dwight
saw
his
students
drawn
to
the
radical
republicanism
and
“
infidel
philosophy
”
of
the
French
Revolution
,
including
the
philosophies
of
Hume
,
Hobbes
,
Tindal
,
and
Lords
Shaftesbury
and
Bolingbroke
.

He
was
elected
a
Fellow
of
the
American
Academy
of
Arts
and
Sciences
in
0000
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
Dwight
frequently
warned
audiences
against
the
threats
of
this
“
infidel
philosophy
”
in
America
.

An
address
to
the
candidates
for
the
baccalaureate
in
Yale
College
called
"
The
Nature
and
Danger
of
Infidel
Philosophy
,
Exhibited
in
Two
Discourses
,
Addressed
to
the
Candidates
for
the
Baccalaureate
,
In
Yale
College
"
was
delivered
on
September
0
,
0000
.

It
was
published
by
George
Bunce
in
0000
.

This
book
is
credited
as
one
of
the
embers
of
the
Second
Great
Awakening
.

A
negative
side
of
Dwight
's
work
was
that
he
opposed
smallpox
vaccination
,
see
Vaccination
and
religion
.

Dwight
was
as
notable
for
his
political
leadership
as
for
his
religious
and
educational
eminence
.

Known
by
his
enemies
as
"
Pope
"
Dwight
,
he
wielded
both
the
temporal
sword
(
as
head
of
Connecticut
's
Federalist
Party
)
,
and
spiritual
sword
(
as
nominal
head
of
the
state
's
Congregational
Church
)
.

He
led
the
effort
to
prevent
the
disestablishment
of
the
church
in
Connecticut
—
and
,
when
its
disestablishment
appeared
inevitable
,
encouraged
efforts
by
protégés
like
Beecher
and
Bacon
to
organize
voluntary
associations
to
maintain
the
influence
of
religion
in
public
life
.

Fearing
that
the
failure
of
states
to
establish
schools
and
the
rise
of
"
infidelity
"
would
bring
about
the
destruction
of
republican
institutions
,
he
helped
to
create
a
national
evangelical
movement
—
the
second
"
Great
Awakening
"
--
intended
to
"
re-church
"
America
.

Dwight
was
a
founder
of
the
Connecticut
Academy
of
Arts
&
Sciences
,
the
American
Board
of
Commissioners
for
Foreign
Missions
,
and
Andover
Theological
Seminary
.

Dwight
was
well
known
as
an
author
,
preacher
,
and
theologian
.

He
and
his
brother
,
Theodore
,
were
members
of
a
group
of
writers
centered
around
Yale
known
as
the
"
Hartford
Wits
.
"

In
verse
,
Dwight
wrote
an
ambitious
epic
in
eleven
books
,
The
Conquest
of
Canaan
,
finished
in
0000
but
not
published
until
0000
,
a
somewhat
ponderous
and
solemn
satire
,
The
Triumph
of
Infidelity
(

,
directed
against
David
Hume
,
Voltaire
and
others
;

,
the
suggestion
for
which
seems
to
have
been
derived
from
John
Denham
's
Coopers
Hill
;
and
a
number
of
minor
poems
and
hymns
,
the
best
known
of
which
is
that
beginning
"

In
human
anatomy
,
the
eardrum
,
or
tympanic
membrane
,
is
a
thin
,
cone-shaped
membrane
that
separates
the
external
ear
from
the
middle
ear
in
humans
and
other
tetrapods
.

Its
function
is
to
transmit
sound
from
the
air
to
the
ossicles
inside
the
middle
ear
,
and
then
to
the
oval
window
in
the
fluid-filled
cochlea
.

Hence
,
it
ultimately
converts
and
amplifies
vibration
in
air
to
vibration
in
fluid
.

The
malleus
bone
bridges
the
gap
between
the
eardrum
and
the
other
ossicles
.

There
are
two
general
regions
of
the
tympanic
membrane
:
the
pars
flaccida
(
upper
region
,
see
picture
on
right
)
and
the
pars
tensa
.

The
pars
flaccida
consists
of
two
layers
,
is
relatively
fragile
,
and
is
associated
with
eustachian
tube
dysfunction
and
cholesteatoma
s.
The
larger
pars
tensa
region
consists
of
three
layers
:
skin
,
fibrous
tissue
,
and
mucosa
.

It
is
comparatively
robust
,
and
is
the
region
most
commonly
associated
with
perforations
.

Rupture
or
perforation
of
the
eardrum
can
lead
to
conductive
hearing
loss
.

Collapse
or
retraction
of
the
eardrum
can
also
cause
conductive
hearing
loss
or
even
cholesteatoma
.

Parts
The
pars
tensa
forms
most
of
the
tympanic
membrane
.

Its
periphery
is
thickened
to
form
a
fibrocartilaginous
ring
called
the
annulus
tympanicus
.

The
central
part
of
the
pars
tensa
is
tented
inwards
at
the
level
of
the
tip
of
malleus
and
is
called
the
umbo
.

A
cone
of
light
can
be
seen
radiating
from
the
tip
of
the
malleus
to
the
periphery
in
the
antero-inferior
quadrant
.

The
pars
flaccida
is
situated
above
the
lateral
process
of
the
malleus
between
the
notch
of
Rivinus
and
the
anterior
and
posterior
malleal
folds
.

It
appears
slightly
pinkish
.

Relations
The
tympanic
membrane
is
superiorly
related
to
middle
cranial
fossa
,
posteriorly
to
the
ear
ossicles
and
the
facial
nerve
,
inferiorly
to
the
parotid
gland
and
anteriorly
to
the
temporomandibular
joint
.

Intentional
rupture
The
Bajau
people
of
the
Pacific
intentionally
rupture
their
eardrums
at
an
early
age
in
order
to
facilitate
diving
and
hunting
at
sea
.

Many
older
Bajau
therefore
have
difficulties
hearing
.

Unintentional
rupture
Unintentional
rupture
of
the
ear
drum
has
been
described
in
blast
injuries
during
conflict
,
but
also
during
air
travel
,
usually
when
the
congestion
of
an
upper
respiratory
infection
has
prevented
equalization
of
pressure
in
the
middle
ear
.

It
is
also
described
in
sport
and
recreation
,
such
as
swimming
,
diving
with
a
poor
entry
into
the
water
,
scuba
diving
and
martial
arts
.

In
the
published
literature
,
00
%
to
00
%
have
recovered
completely
without
intervention
in
two
to
four
weeks
.

These
injuries
,
even
in
a
recreational
or
athletic
setting
,
are
blast
injuries
.

Many
will
experience
some
short-lived
hearing
loss
and
ringing
in
the
ear
(
tinnitus
)
but
can
be
reassured
that
this
,
in
all
likelihood
,
will
pass
.

A
very
few
will
experience
temporary
disequilibrium
(
vertigo
)
.

There
may
be
some
bleeding
from
the
ear
canal
if
the
eardrum
has
been
ruptured
.

Naturally
,
the
foregoing
reassurances
become
more
guarded
as
the
force
of
injury
increases
,
as
in
military
or
combat
situations
.
