Welsh
,
English
,
Scottish
and
Irish
immigrationIn
the
wake
of
the
arrival
of
the
Lackawanna
and
Bloomsburg
Railroad
in
0000
,
a
large
number
of
immigrant
s
came
to
Plymouth
to
work
in
the
coal
mine
s
and
,
as
the
population
grew
,
it
became
more
diverse
.

According
to
the
0000
census
,
Plymouth
Township
had
0,000
residents
.

Of
these
,
00
%
were
born
in
Pennsylvania
.

Among
the
other
00
%
a
small
number
were
foreign
born
:
000
in
Ireland
,
00
in
Wales
,
00
in
England
,
00
in
Scotland
and
00
in
Germany
.

By
the
time
of
the
0000
census
,
the
population
had
grown
to
0,000
,
including
000
born
in
Ireland
,
000
born
in
Wales
and
000
born
in
England
.

In
addition
to
these
newcomers
,
there
were
000
Scots
,
00
Germans
,
00
Canadians
,
0
French
and
0
Norwegian
.

Moreover
,
many
of
the
0,000
Pennsylvania-born
residents
were
the
children
of
these
immigrants
.

By
0000
,
roughly
00
%
of
the
town
's
population
was
either
foreign-born
,
or
the
children
of
foreign-born
parents
.

Along
with
these
new
immigrants
and
the
rapid
increase
in
the
population
,
came
an
inevitable
change
in
character
of
the
town
from
a
sleepy
agrarian
village
to
a
rough
and
tumble
mining
town
.

In
the
mid-0000s
,
there
were
numerous
crimes
and
atrocities
(
often
labor
related
)
attributed
to
Irish
secret
societies
,
collectively
known
as
the
Molly
Maguires
.

A
few
of
these
incidents
occurred
in
Plymouth
,
including
shootings
and
anonymous
death
threats
.

As
an
example
,
on
February
00
,
0000
,
the
Plymouth
Weekly
Star
published
a
threatening
letter
,
or
"
coffin
notice
"
,
which
included
the
demand
that
the
recipient
leave
town
or
else
be
killed
:
A
gentleman
in
the
employ
of
one
of
our
prominent
merchants
has
received
the
following

:

Mr.
Barthe
,
editor
of

,
wrote
that
"
the

is
ornamented
with
a
coffin
,
skull
,

,

&

.

A
reward
will
be
paid
to

"

Samuel
L.
French
,
who
was
Burgess
of
Plymouth
when
this
letter
was
published
,
mentioned
the
Molly
Maguires
in
his
history
,
Reminiscences
of
Plymouth
,
Pa.
,
writing
that
"
one
of
their
number
named
Dunleavy
was
mysteriously
shot
one
evening
in
a
saloon
on
East
Main
Street
,
which
incident
had
the
effect
of
putting
a
quietus
on
the
band
in
Plymouth
.
"

In
addition
to
quarrels
between
newly
arrived
immigrants
and
the
established
order
,
quarrels
often
arose
among
the
immigrant
groups
themselves
.

These
were
sometimes
personal
in
nature
.

The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
,
on
February
00
,
0000
,
reported
one
such
incident
between
two
mineworkers
,
one
Welsh
,
the
other
Irish
.
"

In
a
quarrel
between
James
Kelly
,
a
car
runner
,
and
A.
D.
Williams
,
a
miner
,
at
the
Nottingham
mine
,
Plymouth
,
today
,
the
latter
struck
Kelly
a
terrible
blow
with
a
heavy
piece
of
wood
knocking
him
senseless
.

The
wounded
man
was
taken
home
and
died
in
the
afternoon
.

The
quarrel
arose
out
of
the
division
of
cars
of
which
Kelly
had
charge
.
"

The
influx
of
immigrants
from
the
British
Isles
led
to
the
construction
of
several
new
buildings
,
including
St.
Vincent
's
church
for
the
Roman
Catholic
congregation
,
St.
Peter
's
for
the
Anglicans
,
the
Presbyterian
church
for
a
largely
Scottish
congregation
and
several
new
churches
for
a
variety
of
Welsh
congregations
.

The
Avondale
Mine
Disaster
The
Avondale
Mine
Disaster
occurred
on
September
0
,
0000
,
when
000
men
and
boys
died
at
the
Avondale
Colliery
,
located
just
west
of
the
Plymouth
borough
line
.

A
fire
in
the
mine
shaft
,
ignited
by
a
ventilating
furnace
,
spread
to
the
breaker
which
stood
over
the
shaft
.

The
breaker
was
destroyed
by
fire
,
trapping
those
working
in
the
mine
below
.

All
were
killed
,
as
were
two
men
who
volunteered
to
enter
the
mine
soon
after
the
fire
.

One
result
of
the
disaster
was
the
enactment
in
0000
of
a
law
regulating
mining
which
required
employment
by
the
State
of
mine
inspectors
,
the
mapping
of
all
mine
works
,
the
creation
of
two
means
of
egress
from
every
mine
,
provision
for
proper
ventilation
,
reporting
and
investigation
of
all
accidents
and
the
establishment
of
rules
of
conduct
for
employees
.

Luzerne
County
cities

,
prepared
by
D.G.

in

The

information
about
the

as
it
stood
fifteen
years
after
the
railroad
arrived
,
eight
years
after
the
end
of
the
Civil
War
,
and
seven
years
after
Plymouth
Borough
was
created
out
of
Plymouth

Labor
troublesA
bank
panic
on
September
00
,
0000
,
led
to
a
prolonged
national
depression
,
and
by
0000
there
were
about
three
million
unemployed
,
roughly
00
percent
of
the
working
population
.

These
circumstances
led
to
the
outbreak
known
as
the
Great
Railroad
Strike
of
0000
.

It
was
the
first
nationwide
strike
,
one
in
which
Plymouth
played
a
small
but
interesting
part
.

The
strike
began
in
June
0000
when
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
cut
wages
by
00
percent
.

The
following
month
it
announced
that
all
eastbound
trains
from
Pittsburgh
would
be
doubled
in
size
without
any
increase
in
the
size
of
crews
.

Railroad
workers
declared
a
strike
,
took
control
of
switches
and
blocked
the
movement
of
trains
.

Meanwhile
,
on
July
00
,
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
cut
wages
,
and
on
July
00
the
railroad
's
firemen
and
brakemen
refused
to
work
.

A
sympathy
strike
broke
out
in
Pittsburgh
,
and
troops
were
sent
from
Philadelphia
.

When
the
troops
were
confronted
by
strikers
,
they
fired
into
the
crowd
,
killing
twenty
and
wounding
twenty-nine
.

Workers
broke
into
a
gun
factory
and
seized
rifles
and
small
arms
and
exchanged
gunfire
with
the
soldiers
throughout
the
night
.

On
July
00
,
Pennsylvania
's
governor
ordered
every
militia
regiment
in
the
state
to
report
for
duty
.

Samuel
L.
French
,
Plymouth
's
Burgess
at
the
time
,
recalled
,
"
In
July
,
0000
,
almost
immediately
succeeding
the
peaceful
enjoyments
incident
to
the
centennial
celebration
of
our
national
independence
,
the
country
was
startled
at
the
outbreak
of
very
serious
rioting
by
the
railroad
employees
of
Pittsburgh
.

These
outbreaks
of
lawlessness
,
like
an
epidemic
of
a
contagious
disease
,
rapidly
spread
over
near
the
entire
state
.

Railroad
traffic
was
for
a
time
interrupted
,
employees
being
assaulted
and
engines
and
cars
demolished
.

Local
authorities
were
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
.
"

A
national
strike
was
on
all
over
the
country
.

On
July
00
,
a
general
strike
was
called
in
northeastern
Pennsylvania
on
the
Delaware
and
Hudson
Railroad
and
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
and
Western
Railroad
(
the
line
that
ran
through
Plymouth
)
.

The
mine
workers
employed
by
these
railroads
(
many
from
Plymouth
)
struck
as
well
.

On
August
0
,
three
thousand
state
militia
troops
arrived
in
the
Wyoming
Valley
.

Samuel
L.
French
wrote
,
"
The
miners
in
the
anthracite
regions
of
Schuykill
and
Luzerne
and
Lackawanna
counties
were
at
the
time
on
strike
and
soon
became
infected
.

A
demon
like
spirit
seemed
to
pervade
the
masses
.

In
Scranton
,
Mayor
McKune
had
been
violently
assaulted
,
and
a
posse
of
the
leading
citizens
had
fired
upon
and
killed
several
of
the
rioters
.

A
passenger
train
on
the
L&B
R.R.
,
arriving
at
Plymouth
from
Northumberland
in
the
evening
was
stoned
and
the
train
obliged
to
remain
on
the
siding
at
the
depot
.

I
was
Burgess
at
the
time
and
a
committee
of
representative
citizens
reported
to
me
,
their
fears
of
contemplated
incendiarism
against
certain
of
the
properties
located
here
and
connected
with
mining
industries
,
and
requested
me
to
officially
invoke
protection
from
the
State
.

I
telegraphed
the
State
authorities
and
soon
thereafter
a
regiment
of
soldiers
was
in
possession
of
the
town
.
"
"

...
Brigadier
General
E.
W.
Matthews
,
a
former
school
teacher
in
Plymouth
,
was
in
charge
of
the
troops
which
invaded
the
town
.

In
front
of
the
engine
of
the
train
which
carried
the
troops
was
placed
a
gun
,
and
at
Nanticoke
several
companies
were
disembarked
,
and
as
skirmishers
,
during
the
night
,
proceeded
up
the
road
,
taking
into
custody
every
man
caught
out
of
doors
.

Near
a
hundred
of
these
night
prowlers
were
thus
captured
,
quite
a
number
in
Plymouth
,
some
of
whom
were
carried
to
Scranton
,
there
to
give
an
account
of
their
actions
.

The
troops
remained
stationed
here
,
and
in
the
locality
for
several
weeks
,
the
staff
officers
using
the
stalled
railroad
cars
for
their

Polish
,
Lithuanian
and
Slovakian
immigrationBy
0000
,
a
new
mix
was
added
to
the
population
of
Plymouth
with
the
arrival
of
immigrants
from
Eastern
Europe
.

These
were
welcomed
by
the
mining
companies
because
they
worked
for
low
wages
,
and
thus
undercut
the
bargaining
power
of
the
increasingly
organized
Irish
and
Welsh
miners
.

In
the
0000
census
,
only
00
of
Plymouth
's
residents
were
born
in
Poland
,
00
in
Prussia
,
0
in
Hungary
,
0
in
Austria
and
0
in
Russia
.

Most
likely
they
were
all
ethnically
Slovakia
n
,
Lithuania
n
and
Polish
.

In
0000
,
during
Plymouth
's
great
typhoid
epidemic
,
it
was
implied
(
incorrectly
)
in
the
press
that
the
epidemic
was
caused
by
the
new
immigrants
'
unsanitary
living
conditions
.

In
fact
,
the
disease
was
caused
by
contamination
of
the
town
's
water
supply
by
the
careless
behavior
of
a
typhoid-stricken
dairy
farmer
living
near
the
town
's
water
system
.

Ironically
,
because
some
of
the
immigrants
lived
at
the
lower
end
of
town
(
and
therefore
happened
to
live
close
to
the
source
of
the
water
supply
)
,
they
suffered
disproportionately
from
the
tainted
water
.

As
they
grew
ill
,
their
neighbors
took
notice
and
the
plague
was
quickly
attributed
to
them
and
their
crowded
quarters
.

Furthermore
,
the
town
fathers
were
blamed
for
allowing
such
lax
conditions
.

In
June
0000
,
a
reporter
for
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
wrote
:
"
The
situation
at
Plymouth
is
about
the
same
as
it
has
been
for
a
week
past
.

The
Hungarian
settlement
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
is
reported
to
be
in
a
wretched
condition
.

The
inhabitants
of
this
colony
live
huddled
together
in
filth
,
and
it
has
been
made
known
that
as
many
as
twenty
persons
live
—
eating
,
sleeping
and
cooking
—
in
one
room
.

They
refuse
to
make
known
to
the
Relief
Committee
the
number
of
sick
among
them
.

Steps
will
be
taken
at
once
to
compel
them
to
live
in
a
different
way
or
to
leave
the
town
.
"

The
new
immigrants
were
unwilling
(
or
perhaps
unable
)
to
cooperate
with
the
Relief
Committee
:
among
the
list
of
0,000
victims
treated
at
the
makeshift
hospital
in
the
Central
High
School
,
prepared
by
the
Pennsylvania
Department
of
Health
,
no
names
of
Eastern
European
derivation
are
listed
.

Like
most
immigrants
,
many
of
the
new
arrivals
were
poor
and
uneducated
and
,
at
first
,
spoke
little
or
no
English
.

They
were
referred
to
in
the
press
as
"
foreigners
"
and
during
the
early
years
of
their
arrival
were
often
made
to
feel
unwelcome
.

Their
function
as
strike-breakers
added
to
their
unpopularity
.

On
February
00
,
0000
,
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
reported
:
"
The
Poles
and
Hungarians
who
live
in
such
numbers
in
Plymouth
and
vicinity
promise
to
be
speedily
cleared
out
.

At
different
times
before
several
hundred
have
been
shipped
away
to
fill
the
strikers
place
at
Punxsutawney
by
the
agents
of
the
company
who
are
circulating
throughout
this
region
and
today
000
more
were
sent
off
in
a
special
train
.

They
left
on
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
and
Western
Railroad
at
00
o'clock
,
many
of
them
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
children
and
carrying
a
most
miscellaneous
collection
of
goods
with
them
.

Each
man
was
supplied
with
a
bottle
of
whiskey
,
a
big
paper
of
tobacco
,
and
a
ticket
to
Punxsutawney
.

Another
batch
is
being
raised
and
will
leave
Plymouth
in
a
day
or
two
.
"

While
some
of
the
Eastern
European
immigrants
were
transitory
,
many
more
came
to
Plymouth
and
stayed
,
eventually
forming
a
large
and
important
part
of
the
population
.

By
0000
,
Plymouth
boasted
three
Roman
Catholic
churches
with
Eastern
European
congregations
,
St.
Mary
's
(
Polish
)
,
St.
Stephen
's
(
Slovakian
)
and
St.
Casimir
's
(
Lithuanian
)
.

By
the
0000s
,
these
three
groups
were
said
to
represent
00
%
of
the
town
's
population
.

The
First
Central
High
School
The
first
Central
High
School
was
built
in
0000
by
Samuel
Livingston
French
and
his
Plymouth
Planing
Mill
Co.
.

The
school
saw
its
first
graduating
class
in
0000
,
but
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
February
0000
.

According
to
the
February
00
,
0000
edition
of
the
Wilkes-Barre
Times
:
"
A
serious
fire
occurred
at
Plymouth
this
morning
at
00:00
,
when
the
Plymouth
Central
high
school
was
so
badly
gutted
and
damaged
that
it
will
have
to
be
re-built
.

The
building
is
located
on
Shawnee
Avenue
,
only
a
short
distance
from
the
busiest
section
of
that
town
,
it
being
about
0,000
feet
from
the
Pioneer
and
Wyoming
Valley
knitting
mills
and
Shawnee
box
factory
.

The
fire
was
discovered
at
00:00
and
an
alarm
was
rung
from
Box
00
calling
out
the
entire
fire
department
which
quickly
responded
,
but
the
blaze
had
gained
considerable
headway
and
a
sheet
of
flames
could
be
seen
issuing
from
the
top
of
the
building
.
"
"

The
origin
is
a
mystery
.

The
building
is
heated
by
steam
supplied
by
the
Parrish
Coal
Company
.

There
was
no
fire
in
the
building
whatsoever
...
Ambrose
West
’s
handsome
residence
,
against
the
building
on
the
west
side
,
and
a
double
block
owned
and
occupied
by
Daniel
R.
Davis
,
against
the
building
on
the
east
side
,
were
in
danger
,
but
the
firemen
confined
the
blaze
within
the
brick
walls
of
the
burning
building
.
"
"

The
higher
branches
were
taught
in
this
building
and
a
large
class

The
Typhoid
Epidemic
of
0000The
Typhoid
Epidemic
of
0000
was
caused
by
contamination
of
the
town
's
water
supply
.

Like
the
Avondale
Mine
Disaster
of
0000
,
it
aroused
the
sympathy
of
the
entire
nation
.

The
epidemic
was
eventually
traced
to
a
dairy
farmer
who
lived
on
Mountain
Road
alongside
Coal
Creek
,
the
stream
that
fed
the
town
's
water
supply
.

During
the
Christmas
holiday
in
0000
,
he
visited
his
brother
,
the
owner
of
a
cigar
store
in
Philadelphia
,
and
returned
home
in
January
ill
with
typhoid
.

During
his
weeks
of
recuperation
,
the
snow
on
the
ground
around
his
farmhouse
became
contaminated
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
water
company
's
reservoirs
had
become
so
low
,
that
the
company
began
to
pump
water
,
as
a
substitute
source
,
from
the
Susquehanna
River
.

In
late
March
,
the
weather
began
to
warm
and
the
snow
began
to
melt
,
so
that
the
stream
and
one
of
its
reservoirs
(
known
as
the
Third
Water
Dam
)
became
contaminated
.

Furthermore
,
because
of
the
melting
snow
,
the
reservoir
began
to
fill
.

Hoping
to
stop
pumping
river
water
,
the
water
company
's
superintendent
lit
a
fire
at
the
exit
pipe
of
the
reservoir
,
allowing
water
to
flow
freely
downstream
and
contaminate
the
town
's
water
supply
.

By
the
week
of
April
00
,
between
00-000
new
cases
were
reported
daily
.

By
September
,
0,000
cases
were
recorded
(
out
of
a
population
of
just
over
0,000
)
,
including
000
in
April
,
000
in
May
,
00
in
June
,
00
in
July
,
00
in
August
and
0
in
September
.

Taking
into
account
unreported
cases
,
the
number
was
probably
much
higher
.

Dr.
Morris
Stroud
French
was
a
physician
in
Philadelphia
at
the
time
of
the
epidemic
,
one
of
several
sent
to
Plymouth
to
set
up
a
temporary
hospital
in
the
Central
High
School
building
.

After
the
epidemic
,
French
prepared
a
report
of
the
hospital
's
activities
,
listing
all
the
patients
who
were
treated
,
the
ward
where
they
lived
,
the
length
and
cost
of
their
treatment
,
and
,
when
applicable
,
the
date
of
their
death
.

French
recorded
0,000
victims
,
of
whom
000
died
.

He
estimated
the
cost
of
the
epidemic
,
including
the
cost
of
treatment
and
lost
wages
,
at
about
$
000,000
.

Martin
Wilkes
and
the
Polish-Lithuanian
Church
WarBy
the
time
that
the
0000
city
directory
was
published
,
there
were
three
Roman
Catholic
congregations
in
Plymouth
:
"
St.
Vincent
's
Catholic
Church
"
,
for
"
English-speaking
"
(
mostly
Irish
)
Catholics
,
"
St.
Stephen
's
Hungarian
Catholic
Church
"
,
(
for
Slovakians
)
,
and
"
St.
Mary
's
Polish
Catholic
Church
"
(
for
Poles
and
Lithuanians
)
.

St.
Mary
's
congregation
was
founded
in
the
spring
of
0000
.

The
trustees
purchased
land
on
Willow
Street
and
built
a
small
wooden
church
(
on
the
site
of
the
later
school
building
)
.

Although
the
Poles
and
Lithuanians
spoke
different
languages
,
their
histories
were
intertwined
,
and
the
Diocese
of
Scranton
assumed
the
two
groups
would
amicably
share
the
same
church
and
cemetery
so
long
as
their
parish
priest
was
fluent
in
both
languages
.

As
it
turned
out
,
there
was
an
animosity
between
them
.

In
0000-0000
,
these
feelings
were
inflamed
by
an
outspoken
parishioner
named
Martin
Wilkes
,
who
came
to
be
known
in
the
national
press
as
"
the
Polish
King
"
.

Wilkes
was
born
in
Poland
and
immigrated
to
the
United
States
in
0000
.

By
the
time
of
the
0000
census
,
he
was
working
as
a
coal
miner
,
living
in
West
Nanticoke
,
and
by
0000
,
he
had
acquired
a
saloon
,
gained
a
small
following
and
proclaimed
himself
leader
of
the
Poles
in
Plymouth
.

St.
Mary
's
congregation
's
first
priest
was
Polish
.

But
after
he
departed
,
trouble
arose
when
the
Diocese
of
Scranton
appointed
,
not
once
,
but
twice
,
a
Lithuanian
priest
to
St.
Mary
's
.

The
Poles
objected
on
the
grounds
that
their
greater
number
,
earlier
arrival
and
greater
financial
contribution
entitled
them
to
preference
.

The
second
Lithuanian
priest
,
Father
Alexandras
Burba
,
was
appointed
to
St.
Mary
's
on
August
00
,
0000
.

Burba
spoke
Polish
and
Lithuanian
,
but
was
an
ardent
Lithuanian
nationalist
;
the
Polish
trustees
allowed
him
to
celebrate
mass
in
the
church
but
refused
to
give
him
possession
of
the
parsonage
.

On
October
00
,
Bishop
O'Hara
arrived
from
Scranton
and
sent
Father
Mack
(
of
the
St.
Vincent
's
congregation
)
to
gain
access
to
the
parsonage
,
but
when
he
knocked
on
the
door
,
he
was
"
met
by
three
guns
pointing
at
him
from
an
upstairs
window
.
"

Next
,
Father
Mack
went
to
the
Town
Hall
and
got
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
the
rebel
faction
,
after
which
the
police
arrested
three
of
them
.

When
the
rebels
reached
the
town
lock-up
(
in
an
effort
to
rescue
the
prisoners
)
,
they
encountered
constable
Michael
Melvin
and
in
the
ensuing
scuffle
broke
his
leg
.

According
to
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
,
"
Thousands
of
people
collected
on
Main
Street
...
There
was
some
strong
talk
about
lynching
Martin
Wilkes
,
the
Polish
leader
.

He
was
finally
arrested
and
lodged
in
jail
.

The
Polanders
still
hold
possession
of
the
priest
’s
house
tonight
.

The
Burgess
says
he
will
clear
every
man
out
tomorrow
if
he
has
to
make
dead
men
of
them
all
.
"

After
this
episode
,
Father
Burba
departed
St.
Mary
's
,
and
the
split
between
the
two
nationalities
became
permanent
,
with
the
Lithuanians
forming
their
own
congregation
.

The
war
between
the
Polish
faction
and
the
Scranton
Diocese
settled
into
a
standstill
for
the
Christmas
holidays
,
but
in
January
0000
,
war
resumed
,
and
this
time
the
focus
was
the
cemetery
on
Welsh
Hill
which
the
Diocese
had
created
for
use
by
both
the
Poles
and
the
Lithuanians
.

On
January
00
,
0000
,
a
reporter
for
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
wrote
:
"
The
Polish
church
war
at
Plymouth
is
on
again
.

The
church
authorities
were
about
congratulating
themselves
that
the
difficulty
was
settled
when
they
were
confronted
with
a
new
issue
...
Friday
,
the
little
son
of
a
leader
of
the
Lithuanian
faction
died
,
and
yesterday
afternoon
an
attempt
was
made
to
bury
him
in
the
Polish
cemetery
...
the
Poles
were
on
hand
when
the
funeral
procession
reached
the
gates
of
the
cemetery
.

They
were
armed
with
guns
,
and
one
of
them
raised
his
weapon
and
told
the
driver
of
the
hearse
if
he
dared
to
enter
the
sacred
grounds
he
would
be
shot
on
the
spot
...
The
Lithuanians
did
not
expect
to
meet
with
an
armed
body
of
men
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
retreat
,
which
they
did
speedily
...
A
committee
of
Polanders
went
to
Scranton
last
night
and
had
an
interview
with
Bishop
O'Hara
.

The
latter
said
the
burial
must
take
place
tomorrow
and
he
will
invoke
the
aid
of
the
civil
authorities
.

As
the
Lithuanians
will
comply
with
the
Bishop
's
instructions
,
trouble
is
looked
for
.
"

After
the
incident
at
the
cemetery
,
Martin
Wilkes
was
arrested
and
jailed
in
Wilkes-Barre
and
released
on
bail
.

Once
released
,
he
swore
vengeance
against
the
Lithuanians
.

According
to
the
Philadelphia
Inquirer
,
"
When
Wilkes
reached
his
home
in
Plymouth
,
he
at
once
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
threats
.

He
summoned
about
twenty
of
his
devoted
followers
,
and
arming
themselves
with
shovels
and
pickaxes
,
the
party
left
for
the
cemetery
...
arriving
there
they
opened
the
graves
of
the
two
Lithuanian
children
buried
yesterday
.

The
coffins
were
thrown
over
the
fence
onto
an
adjoining
field
.

One
of
the
bodies
was
badly
lacerated
.

The
pick
axes
had
been
driven
through
it
in
several
places
...
The
Lithuanians
are
gunning
for
Wilkes
.

They
say
they
will
shoot
him
on
sight
.
"

After
the
incident
at
the
cemetery
,
Wilkes
and
seven
associates
were
arrested
and
taken
before
Justice
Donahue
.

They
were
charged
with
forcible
entry
,
detainer
of
a
cemetery
,
violating
a
sepulcher
,
resisting
public
officers
,
felonious
shooting
,
surety
of
the
peace
,
riot
,
and
affray
.

In
February
,
Bishop
O'Hara
installed
a
Polish
priest
at
St.
Mary
's
,
Father
S.
F.
Szymanowski
.

Wilkes
's
first
encounter
with
the
feisty
Father
Szymanowski
was
to
be
his
last
,
as
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
reported
on
February
00
:
"
...
This
evening
Wilkes
and
a
half
dozen
of
his
followers
went
to
Father
Szymanowski
’s
residence
.

They
were
received
pleasantly
by
the
pastor
.

Wilkes
stated
his
mission
,
demanding
that
the
priest
surrender
the
church
books
,
give
up
the
keys
of
the
house
and
vacate
the
premises
.

Before
the
visitors
were
aware
of
it
,
the
priest
reached
to
a
bureau
drawer
,
pulled
out
a
revolver
,
and
pointing
at
the
men
said
:
'
Now
you
fellows
have
made
trouble
enough
in
this
congregation
.

I
will
have
you
understand
this
is
my
house
and
I
want
you
to
get
out
at
once
or
I
will
compel
you
to
.
'

Wilkes
did
n't
wait
to
hear
any
more
.

He
and
his
party
fled
.

Wilkes
and
his
followers
now
threaten
to
burn
the
building
.

The
priest
has
stationed
himself
at
the
window
up
stairs
,
revolver
in
hand
.
"

On
April
00
,
according
to
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
,
Martin
Wilkes
was
"
convicted
of
aggravated
assault
and
battery
on
Constable
[
Michael
]
Melvin
.

There
were
eight
other
indictments
against
the
prisoner
.
"

Wilkes
served
one
and
a
half
years
in
prison
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Lithuanians
had
begun
to
build
their
own
church
,
completed
in
December
0000
,
as
well
as
their
own
cemetery
.

Life
returned
to
normal
for
the
Polish
congregation
,
and
it
no
longer
appeared
in
the
news
.

As
for
Wilkes
,
he
appeared
in
the
newspapers
one
last
time
.

Having
served
his
sentence
,
he
attempted
to
obtain
a
liquor
license
in
Scranton
.

But
Bishop
O'Hara
had
a
long
memory
,
and
took
steps
to
have
the
application
denied
,
and
thereby
managed
to
have
the
last
word
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
Times
,
published
the
following
account
:
"
Many
people
will
recall
Martin
Wilkes
,
who
created
a
great
deal
of
trouble
among
the
Polish
residents
at
Plymouth
two
or
three
years
ago
.

An
effort
was
made
yesterday
in
the
Lackawanna
courts
to
have
the
license
of
a
successful
applicant
transferred
to
Wilkes
,
but
it
seems
the
latter
’s
bad
reputation
has
followed
him
from
Plymouth
to
Scranton
,
for
the
transfer
was
opposed
by
Joseph
O’Brien
,
Esq.
,
who
was
supposed
to
represent
Bishop
O’Hara
in
the
case
although
the
identity
of
his
client
was
not
made
known
.

He
called
George
Smith
,
formerly
of
Plymouth
,
who
testified
that
Wilkes
kept
a
place
in
Plymouth
,
the
reputation
of
which
was
bad
and
that
he
was
refused
a
license
by
the
Luzerne
County
court
two
years
ago
.

He
also
stated
that
Wilkes
was
one
of
the
principals
in
the
Polish
church
riot
and
that
he
ordered
Bishop
O’Hara
out
of
the
house
;
that
he
was
indicted
for
selling
liquor
on
Sunday
,
and
that
the
chief
of
police
had
his
leg
broken
while
making
an
arrest
in
his
place
.

Judge
Archibald
refused
to
grant
the
transfer
.
"

The
electric
railway
and
the
Carey
Avenue
BridgeThe
Plymouth
Street
Railway
was
incorporated
on
May
00
,
0000
,
and
in
0000
its
directors
built
an
electric
railway
,
or
trolley
line
,
down
the
middle
of
Plymouth
's
Main
Street
,
running
from
the
east
end
of
the
borough
to
a
turn-around
at
the
west
end
of
town
.

That
same
year
,
the
line
was
extended
along
the
north
side
of
Ross
Hill
to
Edwardsville
where
transfers
could
be
made
to
a
similar
railway
that
ran
across
the
Market
Street
Bridge
to
Wilkes-Barre
.

When
the
Plymouth
Street
Railway
was
complete
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
&
Wyoming
Valley
Traction
Co.
leased
it
and
operated
it
along
with
several
other
trolley
lines
.

After
the
Carey
Avenue
Bridge
was
completed
in
the
spring
of
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
&
Wyoming
Valley
Traction
Co.
built
a
second
railway
line
across
the
bridge
,
providing
a
second
,
more
direct
route
to
Wilkes-Barre
's
public
square
.

Ultimately
,
the
network
included
the
boroughs
and
townships
of
Ashley
,
Courtdale
,
Edwardsville
,
Forty
Fort
,
Hanover
,

,
Wilkes-Barre
,
and
Wyoming
.

The
trolley
cars
ran
until
the
0000s
and
were
an
important
amenity
,
making
it
easier
for
residents
to
go
to
work
,
to
shop
,
to
visit
friends
and
relatives
,
and
to
spend
time
at
new
amusement
parks
that
sprung
up
along
the
lines
,
including
Sans
Souci
Park
,
located
between
Nanticoke
and
Wilkes-Barre
.

The
Spanish
American
WarIn
0000
,
the
Ninth
Regiment
,
a
state
militia
organization
founded
in
0000
and
headquartered
in
Wilkes-Barre
,
volunteered
to
serve
in
the
war
with
Spain
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
two
days
after
Spain
declared
war
,
the
various
companies
that
formed
the
regiment
(
including
Plymouth
's
Company
I
)
met
at
the
Wilkes-Barre
armory
and
marched
to
the
Lehigh
Valley
railroad
station
.

Enthusiasm
for
the
war
was
at
a
high
point
,
and
it
was
estimated
that
000,000
people
gathered
to
see
the
troops
off
.

In
May
,
they
made
camp
at
Chickamauga
Park
,
Georgia
,
where
in
July
an
outbreak
of
typhoid
occurred
with
roughly
half
of
the
0,000
troops
contracting
the
disease
,
from
which
00
men
died
.

The
war
ended
on
August
00
while
the
Ninth
Regiment
was
still
camped
in
Georgia
,
and
on
September
00
the
regiment
returned
to
Wilkes-Barre

.

The
start
of
the
00th
centuryDecember
00
,
0000
,
was
the
last
day
of
the
00th
century
.

That
morning
John
Kinney
,
an
old
man
who
came
from
Tipperary
decades
before
,
and
Margaret
Carey
,
an
infant
,
were
both
buried
in
the
Welsh
Hill
cemetery
.

William
Cleary
,
the
town
's
correspondent
for
the
Wilkes-Barre
Times
,
and
his
betrothed
,
Mary
Lynch
,
made
preparations
for
their
upcoming
wedding
.

That
evening
,
the
married
couples
on
Welsh
Hill
held
a
New
Year
reception
at
Owen
's
Hall
,
featuring
an
"
old
time
"
hoop
dance
.

Andy
Brennan
,
the
Master
of
Ceremonies
,
joked
that
the
new
century
was
the
last
any
of
them
would
ever
see
.

The
Plymouth
Band
performed
dance
music
at
the
Plymouth
Armory
,
while
professor
William
Lewis
's
choir
performed
a
midnight
High
Mass
at
St.
Vincent
's
church
(
Nora
Heffernan
,
Margaret
Gallagher
and
John
Ryan
were
the
soloists
and
Joseph
Flaherty
the
organist
)
.

On
New
Year
's
Day
,
the
Ebenezer
Baptist
Church
held
an
extended
service
including
a
roll
call
of
the
members
,
a
song
service
led
by
Mary
Philips
,
a
student
at
the
Philadelphia
Bible
Institute
,
and
a
temperance
address
for
the
children
.

At
Duffy
's
Hall
,
the
Plymouth
Athletic
Association
held
a
series
of
boxing
matches
.

In
the
grand
finale
,
Hayden
from
Wilkes-Barre
fought
three
rounds
against
Wilson
of
Danville
,
the
latter
described
in
the
newspapers
as
the
"
dark
wonder
.
"

For
those
who
wanted
to
memorialize
themselves
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
century
,
James
Beacham
,
Plymouth
's
talented
photographer
,
opened
his
studio
for
portraits
.

Those
who
had
lived
in
Plymouth
during
the
previous
forty
years
had
much
to
recall
.

During
that
time
,
Plymouth
had
nearly
reached
its
ultimate
state
.

Virtually
all
the
streets
that
would
ever
be
created
were
now
in
place
,
and
most
of
the
houses
,
churches
and
commercial
buildings
that
would
ever
be
built
had
now
been
built
.

Plymouth
's
coal
mines
were
established
and
consolidated
in
the
hands
of
a
small
number
of
operators
,
and
its
water
system
,
telegraph
and
telephone
service
,
electrical
lines
and
gas
pipes
were
fully
developed
.

A
trolley
system
connected
the
residents
to
all
of
the
neighboring
towns
and
cities
.

The
next
00
years
would
be
mostly
prosperous
ones
during
which
the
town
's
residents
would
enjoy
the
bounty
of
the
years
of
industrial
growth
.

Coal
production
would
grow
and
the
population
steadily
increase
in
size
and
wealth
.

One
of
the
problems
that
this
increase
presented
was
the
need
to
build
sufficient
school
buildings
to
accommodate
the
growing
population
,
and
the
growing
number
of
families
who
could
now
afford
to
send
their
children
to
school
,
rather
than
to
work
in
the
mines
.

Years
of
prosperity

The
Great
Flood
of
0000One
of
the
most
destructive
flood
s
in
the
history
of
the
Wyoming
Valley
occurred
on
Sunday
,
March
0
,
0000
,
when
the
waters
of
the
Susquehanna
River
rose
and
flooded
a
vast
developed
area
.

It
was
the
largest
flood
since
the
Great
Flood
of
0000
.

Eight
deaths
were
reported
in
Wilkes-Barre
.

The
temperature
suddenly
rose
,
and
snow
which
had
covered
much
of
the
Susquehanna
's
watershed
melted
.

At
the
same
time
,
more
than
of
rain
fell
within
a
short
period
.

The
combined
melted
snow
and
rain
caused
the
river
to
rise
rapidly
and
the
ice
to
break
on
February
00
.

All
day
Saturday
,
March
0
,
the
river
rose
,
until
Sunday
when
it
crested
at
above
the
low
water
mark
.

Wyoming
Valley
had
experienced
less
extensive
flooding
a
few
months
earlier
,
on
December
00
,
0000
,
and
therefore
,
residents
were
more
prepared
than
they
might
have
been
.

In
Plymouth
,
water
covered
the
streets
closest
to
the
river
and
surrounded
or
flooded
many
houses
.

The
railroads
were
damaged
,
bridges
were
swept
away
and
great
portions
of
roadbeds
washed
out
.

Wyoming
Valley
's
street
car
system
was
paralyzed
,
and
it
was
a
few
weeks
before
cars
were
run
regularly
.

Plymouth
recovered
quickly
from
the
0000
flood
.

On
March
0
,
trains
began
running
on
schedule
to
Scranton
on
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
Railroad
.

And
by
March
0
,
the
first
street
car
arrived
in
town
from
Edwardsville
.

The
West
family
set
up
an
electric
pump
on
Main
Street
and
began
pumping
out
flooded
cellars
for
the
town
's
businessmen
.

Capt.
Theodore
Renshaw
went
to
Peter
Shupp
's
old
house
on
Center
Avenue
and
measured
the
flood
's
high-water
mark
and
found
it
to
be
at
street
curb
level
.

Renshaw
recalled
that
the
0000
flood
had
risen
above
the
floor
of
Shupp
's
residence
,
and
calculated
that
the
0000
flood
had
been
0
'
-0
"
higher
than
the
0000
flood
.

The
second
Central
High
SchoolThe
architect
of
the
second
Central
High
School
was
Harry
Livingston
French
.

In
0000
,
when
French
was
awarded
the
commission
to
design
the
new
school
,
he
was
already
well
known
to
the
Plymouth
school
board
:
French
was
a
native
of
Plymouth
,
descended
from
an
old
and
distinguished
family
.

In
0000
,
when
the
school
board
commissioned
him
to
design
alterations
to
the
Franklin
Street
School
,
Harry
French
had
been
an
architect
for
only
a
few
years
.

He
graduated
from
Cornell
University
in
0000
,
but
soon
after
left
for
Meeker
,
Colorado
,
where
his
brother
practiced
medicine
.

French
spent
sixteen
months
in
Meeker
,
returning
east
in
the
beginning
of
0000
.

By
April
0000
,
his
firm
,
McCormick
&
French
,
had
won
third
place
in
the
design
competition
for
the
new
Luzerne
County
Courthouse
.

For
their
efforts
,
they
received
a
prize
of
$
000
.

However
,
in
0000
,
architect
F.
J.
Osterling
of
Pittsburgh
,
the
winner
of
the
competition
,
was
forced
to
resign
in
the
middle
of
construction
.

He
was
replaced
by
McCormick
&
French
.

Harry
French
inherited
numerous
social
,
business
and
political
connections
—
his
father
was
Samuel
Livingston
French
,
born
in
Plymouth
on
September
0
,
0000
,
a
great-grandson
of
Noah
Wadhams
,
Plymouth
's
illustrious
00th
century
preacher
.

Samuel
L.
French
was
a
veteran
of
the
Civil
War
,
having
served
in
the
Union
Army
from
0000
to
0000
.

Afterwards
,
he
was
a
politically
active
Republican
.

In
0000
,
he
was
elected
Register
of
Wills
for
Luzerne
County
,
and
in
0000
,
became
the
first
clerk
of
the
Orphans
'
Court
.

In
0000
,
he
was
elected
to
the
first
of
several
terms
as
Burgess
of
Plymouth
,
and
held
that
office
during
the
great
labor
troubles
of
0000
.

Samuel
L.
French
was
also
an
amateur
historian
—
he
wrote
a
book
about
the
Army
of
the
Potomac
,
and
in
0000
published
Reminiscences
of
Plymouth
,
his
homage
to
the
antebellum
years
of
his
hometown
.

In
0000
,
Samuel
L.
French
became
a
retail
lumber
dealer
,
founding
the
Plymouth
Planing
Mill
Company
,
which
he
ran
until
0000
.

It
was
this
company
which
built
the
old
Central
High
School
in
0000
.

The
old
school
,
and
the
new
one
that
replaced
it
,
sat
on
a
bluff
overlooking
the
Parrish
Colliery
of
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
.

Both
school
and
colliery
sat
on
land
that
once
was
part
of
the
Wadhams
estate
.

After
the
fire
,
the
school
board
must
have
engaged
McCormick
and
French
immediately
,
for
it
was
only
one
month
after
the
fire
that
the
board
met
to
announce
that
the
architects
'
plans
were
accepted
,
plans
for
a
much
larger
building
than
the
original
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
Times
reported
:
"
At
a
special
meeting
of
the
school
board
held
last
evening
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
,
J.
A.
Opp
,
held
for
the
purpose
of
adopting
the
plans
and
specifications
of
the
proposed
new
school
building
,
which
is
to
take
the
place
of
the
building
which
was
burned
down
on
February
00
,
it
was
decided
to
accept
the
plans
that
had
been
prepared
by
McCormick
and
French
.

The
plans
are
for
a
building
of
sixteen
rooms
,
which
is
twice
the
size
of
the
old
building
,
and
it
will
be
a
substantial
structure
,
which
will
be
one
of
the
prettiest
buildings
in
town
.

The
secretary
was
instructed
to
advertise
for
bid
,
and
another
meeting
will
be
called
on
April
00
for
the
purpose
of
opening
the
bids
and
awarding
the
contract
.

A
motion
was
unanimously
carried
that
the
sale
of
bonds
be
held
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
on
April
00
.
"

On
June
0
that
year
,
the
class
of
"
nineteen-five
"
held
its
commencement
exercises
.

Fourteen
students
received
their
diplomas
.

Charles
H.
Kaeufer
read
an
eloquent
speech
entitled
"
Memorial
of
the
Central
Building
"
.
"

Workmen
have
now
removed
the
last
traces
of
the
old
school
.

Whatever
will
remain
of
the
old
building
in
the
future
is
embedded
in
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
boys
and
girls
who
have
come
to
maturity
during
the
twenty-one
years
of
its
usefulness
.

The
shelter
which
the
building
has
afforded
has
resulted
in
the
up-building
of
character
and
the
implanting
of
healthy
sentiments
in
the
boys
and
girls
of
Plymouth
.

The
expenditure
has
not
been
in
vain
.

The
building
has
been
a
fortress
against
ignorance
and
superstition
.

Its
memory
should
be
cherished
lovingly
.

Patriotism
has
been
infused
,
industry
fostered
,
and
wickedness
condemned
.

Therefore
the
influence
of
the
building
must
be
ranked
among
the
permanent
possessions
of
the
community
.
"

On
the
following
evening
,
the
Plymouth
High
School
Alumni
Association
held
its
fourth
annual
banquet
.

Mrs.
L.
S.
Smith
,
one
of
the
"
few
surviving
members
"
of
the
first
graduating
class
(
0000
)
,
spoke
of
her
memories
of
the
old
school
,
a
talk
that
was
followed
by
a
musical
presentation
and
a
toast
given
by
the
future
governor
of
Pennsylvania
,
Arthur
James
.

The
summer
of
0000
came
and
went
as
work
began
on
the
new
school
.

On
August
00
,
the
Times
reported
that
"
sills
were
laid
for
the
new
Central
School
house
yesterday
.
"

On
August
00
,
pupils
were
ordered
to
report
to
Rooms
0
and
0
of
the
Willow
St.
School
.

The
class
of
0000
would
spend
the
entire
school
year
in
temporary
quarters
,
for
it
was
not
until
Labor
Day
,
September
0
,
0000
,
that
the
new
building
was
dedicated
.

The
Wilkes-Barre
Times
sent
a
reporter
:
"
Plymouth
's
handsome
new
High
school
was
dedicated
and
formally
opened
to-day
with
impressive
and
appropriate
exercises
amid
the
cheers
of
several
thousand
people
.

Prior
to
the
exercises
at
the
school
there
was
a
grand
parade
,
in
which
many
secret
societies
from
in
and
out
of
town
took
part
,
together
with
bands
of
music
...
The
parade
formed
at
the
corner
of
Main
and
Bridge
Streets
,
moved
to
Davenport
,
countermarched
to
Gaylord
and
thence
to
the
high
school
where
the
exercises
were
held
...
“
The
progress
of
the
public
school
”
was
the
subject
of
an
eloquent
address
by
J.
Q.
Creveling
,
who
began
by
comparing
the
present
school
system
with
that
of
years
gone
by
when
Plymouth
and
all
its
institutions
were
in
their
infancy
.

He
spoke
of
the
rapid
advancement
in
the
education
of
America
's
army
of
children
and
of
the
responsibility
resting
upon
the
thousands
of
men
and
women
employed
in
the
work
of
fitting
them
to
enter
upon
life
’s
duties
.
"

The
event
was
organized
by
the
Junior
Order
of
United
American
Mechanics
,
perhaps
a
union
representing
the
men
who
built
the
building
.

The
O.U.A.M.
presented
the
school
with
a
new
flag
as
well
as
a
bible
for
each
classroom
.

The
new
building
served
as
Plymouth
’s
high
school
for
only
seven
years
,
for
on
Labor
Day
,
September
0000
,
another
parade
and
dedication
exercise
took
place
,
this
time
to
celebrate
the
opening
of
yet
another
new
high
school
building
—
this
one
on
Main
Street
.

After
0000
,
the
0000
Central
High
School
was
used
to
educate
children
in
the
lower
grades
.

The
third
high
school
buildingPlymouth
's
third
high
school
building
was
dedicated
on
September
0
,
0000
,
following
a
large
parade
through
the
town
.

The
parade
featured
the
police
force
,
three
fire
departments
,
the
school
directors
,
school
children
on
floats
,
various
labor
unions
and
several
fraternal
organizations
.

At
the
ceremony
,
the
Central
School
children
sang
"
March
of
our
Nation
"
,
and
after
the
graduates
of
the
class
of
0000
raised
the
flag
,
the
students
and
audience
sang
"
The
Star-Spangled
Banner
,
"
accompanied
by
the
school
's
marching
band
.

The
chairman
of
the
dedication
ceremony
was
Harold
L.
Freeman
,
and
the
architect
of
the
new
building
was
his
brother
,
New
York
's
Alfred
Freeman
,
a
Plymouth
native
and
graduate
of
Plymouth
High
School
's
class
of
0000
.

The
building
was
built
by
Perkins
and
Heffernan
,
and
the
plumbing
work
installed
by
Doyle
Brothers
,
both
Plymouth
firms
.

The
building
(
which
was
later
added
onto
)
had
four
rooms
on
the
first
floor
and
four
on
the
second
floor
plus
a
large
study
room
.

The
basement
was
reserved
for
the
cloakrooms
,
boiler
rooms
,
lavatories
and
a
room
for
the
School
Directors
.

William
B.
Cleary
,
writing
in
the
Wilkes-Barre
Times
Leader
,
noted
that
"
The
new
school
building
is
located
in
the
central
portion
of
the
town
,
set
back
sufficiently
from
the
main
street
to
give
it
an
important
position
and
affords
an
opportunity
to
make
most
attractive
grounds
.
"

Noting
that
the
building
has
been
marked
for
demolition
in
0000
,
architectural
historian
(
and
former
attendee
)
Michael
Lewis
commented
in
The
Times
Leader
:
"
As
far
as
architecture
is
concerned
,
the
high
school
is
neither
original
nor
innovative
.

It
is
simply
one
of
those
solid
,
serviceable
and
beautifully
constructed
school
buildings
built
a
century
ago
,
when
it
seemed
that
America
could
build
durable
and
efficient
public
buildings
effortlessly
.
"

The
First
National
Bank
BuildingIn
0000
,
the
First
National
Bank
announced
plans
to
construct
a
new
building
designed
by
architect
Harry
Livingston
French
.

It
was
completed
by
August
00
,
0000
,
when
a
reporter
for
the
Times-Leader
inspected
the
building
and
pronounced
it
satisfactory
:
"
The
handsome
new
bank
building
is
thirty-four
feet
wide
and
eighty
feet
long
,
and
rests
upon
a
reinforced
concrete
slab
,
sixteen
inches
thick
.

It
is
entirely
fireproof
in
all
parts
of
its
construction

The
First
World
WarThe
First
World
War
broke
out
in
0000
,
but
America
remained
neutral
until
it
declared
war
on
Germany
on
April
0
,
0000
.

The
Selective
Service
Act
of
0000
was
passed
on
May
00
,
0000
,
and
by
July
a
lottery
was
scheduled
so
that
local
districts
could
meet
their
assigned
quotas
of
men
.

District
0
(
comprising
Plymouth
and
Larksville
boroughs
)
was
initially
required
to
furnish
000
men
,
and
many
more
,
men
and
women
,
would
eventually
serve
.

The
war
ended
when
an
armistice
was
signed
on
November
00
,
0000
,
but
"
Welcome
Home
"
day
in
Plymouth
was
not
celebrated
until
June
00
,
0000
.

That
day
,
a
parade
formed
,
with
the
public
school
students
gathering
at
Wadhams
Street
,
fraternal
lodges
on
Girard
Avenue
,
soldiers
and
sailors
on
Gaylord
Avenue
,
the
Polish
and
Slovak
societies
on
Centre
Avenue
,
and
Catholic
school
children
on
Eno
Street
.

Participants
marched
up
to
the
Carey
Avenue
Bridge
and
back
to
Gaylord
Avenue
where
they
disbanded
.

Burgess
George
E.
Gwilliam
declared
the
day
to
be
"
one
of
rejoicing
with
a
cessation
of
all
labor
,
"
and
banned
all
cars
and
trolleys
from
the
streets
.

After
the
parade
,
all
four
movie
theaters
opened
their
doors
to
veterans
free
of
charge
.

By
the
time
of
the
"
Welcome
Home
"
parade
of
0000
,
a
fundraising
drive
was
underway
to
erect
a
monument
to
the
soldiers
and
sailors
who
had
served
in
the
First
World
War
.

A
committee
was
formed
,
and
George
T.
Brewster
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
a
sculptor
from
New
York
,
was
engaged
.

Brewster
had
studied
at
the
Massachusetts
State
Normal
Art
School
,
and
in
Paris
at
the
École
des
Beaux-Arts
.

Since
0000
,
he
had
been
busy
creating
a
large
number
or
statues
,
busts
and
relief
portraits
for
the
Vicksburg
National
Military
Park
.

For
Plymouth
,
Brewster
prepared
a
design
of
two
life-size
figures
,
a
soldier
and
sailor
,
mounted
atop
a
granite
base
.

In
the
contract
,
the
sculptor
agreed
not
to
duplicate
the
design
anywhere
in
Pennsylvania
.

The
unveiling
was
scheduled
for
November
00
,
0000
,
but
the
work
was
delayed
and
funds
ran
short
.

The
bronze
plaque
,
listing
the
names
of
the
fallen
,
was
optimistically
dated
Memorial
Day
,
0000
.

The
dedication
finally
took
place
on
November
00
,
0000
,
two
years
after
the
war
's
end
.

Schools
and
mines
were
closed
for
the
day
,
and
afterward
a
parade
formed
,
said
to
be
Plymouth
's
largest
ever
.

The
monument
still
stands
and
is
the
principal
public
work
of
art
in
the
borough
.

The
fourth
high
school
buildingPlymouth
's
fourth
high
school
building
was
completed
in
0000
on
a
site
immediately
to
the
west
of
the
third
high
school
(
which
then
became
the
Junior
High
School
building
)
.

The
new
building
cost
$
000,000
and
was
dedicated
on
February
00
,
0000
.

A
few
weeks
before
the
dedication
,
a
reporter
took
a
tour
of
the
building
,
writing
that
:
"
After
years
of
anticipation
and
debate
,
the
new
high
school
represents
the
achievement
of
an
ideal
.

It
has
advanced
Plymouth
several
years
ahead
of
the
status
formerly
held
.

Allied
with
the
adjacent
recreation
field
,
where
athletics
are
carried
out
,
the
school
is
a
complete
foundry
of
young
manhood
and
young
womanhood
,
an
inspiration
to
the
spirit
that
has
written
the
name
of
Plymouth
High
School
upon
the
top
of
the
roster
of
public
educational
institutions
.
"

Many
of
the
town
's
residents
credited
school
board
member
Ward
P.
Davenport
for
expediting
the
construction
of
the
school
,
for
attending
to
its
details
and
for
keeping
the
costs
under
control
.

By
the
time
the
school
was
complete
,
Davenport
was
in
poor
health
and
retreated
to
Atlantic
City
to
recuperate
.

Davenport
's
health
did
not
improve
,
and
the
December
0000
issue
of
the
school
's
newspaper
,
the
Shawnee
Arrow
,
made
note
of
his
death
.

By
the
spring
of
0000
,
the
school
had
been
renamed
Ward
P.
Davenport
High
School
,
and
the
stone
tablet
over
the
front
door
with
the
inscription
"
Plymouth
High
School
"
was
replaced
with
one
inscribed
with
Davenport
's
name
.

Years
of
retrenchment
(
0000-0000
)
Plymouth
Post
OfficeIn
November
0000
,
funds
were
allocated
for
a
new
post
office
building
in
Plymouth
.

The
allocation
was
expedited
by
two
Plymouth
natives
,
Michael
E.
Comerford
,
the
movie-theater
owner
,
who
happened
to
be
the
regional
representative
of
the
recently
created
National
Recovery
Administration
,
and
Frank
C.
Walker
,
Comerford
's
nephew
,
a
Roosevelt
ally
and
the
NRA
's
executive
secretary
.

Among
the
sites
suggested
by
the
Plymouth
Chamber
of
Commerce
was
the
east
half
of
the
old
railroad
depot
,
across
Main
Street
from
the
Plymouth
high
school
,
more
or
less
where
the
new
post
office
was
built
.

President
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
was
an
amateur
architect
who
admired
early
American
architecture
,
and
the
new
building
was
designed
in
the
Georgian
style
that
was
especially
popular
at
the
time
.

An
addition
,
undistinguished
but
sympathetic
to
the
original
wing
,
was
built
in
the
0000s
.

The
post
office
's
most
interesting
feature
is
a
mural
installed
in
0000
by
the
noted
artist
Jared
Blanford
French
(
0000
–
0000
)
entitled
"
Mealtime
,
The
Early
Coal
Miners
,
"
one
of
more
than
0,000
works
of
art
commissioned
by
the
U.S.
Treasury
between
the
years
0000
and
0000
through
a
program
intended
to
embellish
Federal
buildings
and
encourage
the
arts
during
the
Great
Depression
.

French
's
mural
and
the
town
's
Soldiers
and
Sailors
monument
are
the
two
most
significant
secular
public
works
of
art
in
Plymouth
.

The
Great
Flood
of
0000One
of
the
Susquehanna
River
's
most
damaging
floods
occurred
in
March
0000
.

In
the
Wyoming
Valley
,
the
flood
waters
covered
approximately
.

Property
loss
in
Plymouth
Borough
alone
was
estimated
to
be
about
$
0,000,000
.

A
large
number
of
Plymouth
residents
were
left
homeless
,
and
many
volunteers
responded
to
help
with
rescue
and
relief
efforts
.

These
were
coordinated
from
headquarters
set
up
in
the
Town
Hall
building
.

The
Vine
Street
and
Franklin
Street
schools
were
converted
to
temporary
dormitories
,
and
the
Central
School
served
as
a
makeshift
hospital
.

The
town
's
three
fire
companies
patrolled
the
flooded
areas
during
the
inundation
,
and
afterward
did
duty
pumping
out
flooded
cellars
.

After
the
flood
waters
receded
,
Atty.
Harold
L.
Freeman
and
Mrs.
John
Q.
Mask
chaired
a
fund-raising
drive
to
aid
families
left
destitute
by
the
disaster
,
while
Mrs.
Ralph
Worthington
and
Mrs.
C.
C.
Groblewski
coordinated
donations
of
clothing
made
by
the
Red
Cross
.

The
First
National
Bank
's
00th
anniversaryIn
0000
,
Plymouth
's
First
National
Bank
celebrated
its
00th
anniversary
,
and
published
a
pamphlet
of
the
town
's
and
the
bank
's
history
.

The
bank
began
operating
in
0000
,
and
following
the
Civil
War
,
as
America
's
economy
grew
by
leaps
and
bounds
,
Plymouth
and
the
First
National
grew
with
it
.

The
bank
was
a
success
by
one
important
measure
:
in
0000
,
deposits
stood
at
$
000,000
,
and
by
0000
,
(
the
bank
's
,
and
the
town
's
,
apogee
)
deposits
had
grown
to
$
0,000,000
.

The
bank
even
survived
the
Great
Depression
—
while
deposits
declined
,
in
0000
they
were
still
a
respectable
$
0,000,000
.

The
pamphlet
's
authors
,
glancing
back
at
the
difficult
economic
times
of
the
previous
decade
,
asked
and
answered
the
question
of
the
town
's
future
prosperity
:
"
Does
coal
remain
here
in
quantities
to
guarantee
a
second
era
of
anthracite
prosperity
?

In
the
final
perfection
of
production
and
marketing
we
find
that
Glen
Alden
Company
has
produced
00
to
00
percent
of
all
Plymouth
’s
fuel
contribution
.

Its
engineers
look
forward
to
another
hundred
years
of
operation
.
"

But
neither
the
bank
nor
Glen
Alden
’s
engineers
anticipated
the
impact
of
two
rival
energy
sources
,
oil
and
natural
gas
,
both
of
them
cheaper
to
extract
and
to
ship
than
anthracite
coal
.

The
anthracite
industry
received
a
temporary
boost
during
the
Second
World
War
,
but
by
the
late
0000s
,
the
industry
was
all
but
dead
,
with
the
exception
of
some
strip
mine
operations
that
continued
throughout
the
0000s
.

The
pamphlet
's
authors
cited
another
example
of
progress
,
the
construction
of
"
great
flood
dykes
,
started
after
the
highest
of
all
river
rises
in
0000
caused
millions
of
dollars
of
loss
.
"

We
read
of
a
"
dyke
system
which
will
shield
the
community
from
such
disasters
as
Plymouth
and
all
of
Wyoming
Valley
suffered
from
water
in
0000
,
0000
,
0000
and
0000
.
"

Unfortunately
,
the
dike
system
was
unable
to
withstand
the
flood
waters
of
0000
,
which
rose
higher
than
those
of
0000
,
washing
over
the
dikes
and
dealing
a
severe
blow
to
an
already
reeling
economy
.

As
for
the
bank
,
it
survived
only
thirteen
years
beyond
its
anniversary
.

In
0000
,
the
Wyoming
National
Bank
of
Wilkes-Barre
acquired
all
of
its
assets
while
continuing
to
do
business
in
the
Plymouth
building
.

The
Wyoming
National
sold
the
building
after
the
0000
flood
.

The
Diamond
Jubilee
celebration
of
0000In
September
0000
,
seventy-five
years
after
Plymouth
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
,
the
town
began
a
five-day
celebration
at
Huber
Field
,
including
a
pageant
with
the
patriotic
theme
"
America
on
Parade
"
.

Like
many
American
towns
,
Plymouth
had
an
ethnically
diverse
population
,
formed
largely
by
the
descendants
of
Irish
,
Welsh
,
Polish
,
Lithuanian
and
Slovakian
immigrants
.

Patriotism
had
an
important
place
in
the
school
curriculum
,
and
the
generation
that
was
coming
of
age
in
0000
had
been
educated
to
think
of
themselves
as
Americans
first
and
foremost
.

After
the
Grand
Finale
of
the
pageant
,
according
to
the
Jubilee
's
promotional
pamphlet
,
the
audience
was
"
requested
to
join
with
the
cast
and
with
the
Shawnee
Choral
Society
in
the
singing
of
our
National
Anthem
.
"

While
the
townspeople
celebrated
,
war
was
raging
in
Europe
and
Asia
.

The
ninth
scene
of
the
pageant
,
"
Democracy
Defended
"
,
was
described
in
the
Jubilee
's
pamphlet
as
a.
.
.
"

...
tableau
of
“
Peace
,
”
following
the
[
First
]
World
War
—
a
war
which
we
fought
to
“
end
war
”
.

It
is
presented
as
a
tribute
to
the
brave
men
and
courageous
women
who
gave
their
all
so
that
Democracy
might
survive
,
and
in
the
hope
that
America
may
continue
to
remain
honorably
at
Peace
.
"

The
prayer
for
peace
went
unanswered
:
the
celebration
took
place
two
months
before
the
Japanese
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
,
when
America
was
drawn
once
again
into
war
.

Many
men
and
women
from
Plymouth
served
in
the
armed
forces
during
the
Second
World
War
.

The
writers
of
the
Plymouth
Diamond
Jubilee
pamphlet
expressed
optimism
about
the
future
.

In
the
pageant
's
tenth
scene
,
"
American
and
Plymouth
Today
"
,
the
Diamond
Jubilee
Queen
,
Catherine
Oldfield
(
in
later
years
a
Plymouth
school
teacher
known
as
Catherine
Bogdon
)
,
delivered
her
address
of
welcome
"
attended
by
boys
and
girls
,
young
men
and
women
of
Plymouth
and
vicinity
.
"

The
scene
was
described
as
"
symbolic
of
modern
youth
,
keeping
step
with
the
times
,
moving
forward
in
step
with
current
events
.

They
are
the
men
and
women
of
tomorrow
—
the
destiny
of
America
we
love
will
be
in
their
hands
.
"

But
owing
to
the
decline
of
the
local
economy
,
many
of
the
young
men
and
women
in
attendance
would
have
to
move
elsewhere
in
order
find
work
.

The
Plymouth
Diamond
Jubilee
celebration
of
0000
occurred
at
an
interesting
time
in
the
town
's
history
.

Still
vital
,
and
having
survived
a
decade-long
economic
depression
,
the
town
looked
forward
to
a
return
to
its
past
prosperity
.

But
unbeknown
to
the
populace
,
a
slow
and
steady
decline
would
soon
begin
.

Because
of
the
collapse
of
the
anthracite
coal
industry
,
the
town
's
population
,
00,000
in
0000
,
would
decline
to
0,000
by
the
year
0000
.

Plymouth
centennial
celebrationIn
0000
,
the
residents
of
Plymouth
celebrated
the
000th
anniversary
of
the
incorporation
of
the
Borough
of
Plymouth
.

The
honorary
chairman
was
the
Burgess
,
Edward
F.
Burns
,
and
the
general
chairman
was
Angelo
Grasso
.

The
festivities
began
on
June
00
,
0000
with
the
Centennial
Ball
,
held
at
the
Gaylord
Avenue
Armory
,
during
which
Sandy
Smith
was
chosen
to
be
Miss
Plymouth
Centennial
.

A
week
of
parades
and
parties
culminated
on
June
00
,
Pioneer
and
Homecoming
Day
,
with
the
Grand
Parade
.

In
between
,
the
Centennial
Committee
presented
at
Huber
Field
"
In
Olde
Shawnee
"
,
a
fifteen-episode
spectacle
produced
by
John
B.
Rogers
Productions
of
Fostoria
,
Ohio
.

Many
residents
,
church
groups
,
and
civic
and
fraternal
groups
participated
in
the
Centennial
.

During
Centennial
Week
,
many
women
donned
old-time
costumes
from
colonial
days
,
and
many
men
grew
goatees
,
moustaches
and
"
mutton-chop
"
side-burns
,

School
consolidation
0000-0000The
first
Plymouth
High
School
graduating
class
received
their
diplomas
in
0000
,
and
the
last
graduating
class
received
theirs
in
0000
.

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
Plymouth
's
school
system
merged
with
the
Edwardsville
and
Larksville
schools
to
become
"
Plymouth
Area
High
School
"
,
one
of
three
divisions
in
a
consolidated
school
district
called
"
Wyoming
Valley
West
"
.

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
the
Plymouth
Area
division
combined
with
the
other
schools
in
the
district
to
form
a
single
high
school
in
which
freshmen
and
sophomores
attended
the
Plymouth
high
school
building
,
and
juniors
and
seniors
attended
the
Kingston
high
school
building
.

Currently
,
the
Wyoming
Valley
West
High
School
building
is
located
in
Plymouth
,
south
of
Shawnee
Avenue
,
near
the
site
of
the
old
Central
High
School
,
Plymouth
's
second
high
school
building
(
0000
)
,
which
has
been
demolished
.

Plymouth
's
third
high
school
building
(
0000
)
still
stands
and
is
now
the
Main
Street
Elementary
Center
.

Plymouth
's
fourth
high
school
building
(
0000
)
,
known
as
the
Ward
P.
Davenport
High
School
,
was
demolished
after
the
Agnes
Flood
of
0000
.

Agnes
FloodUnlike
earlier
floods
in
the
Wyoming
Valley
,
most
of
which
were
caused
by
spring
freshets
,
the
0000
flood
was
caused
by
bizarre
and
unusual
weather
patterns
,
including
heavy
rainfall
that
began
in
mid-April
.

In
May
almost
of
rain
fell
,
and
in
June
another
fell
,
so
that
by
late
June
the
Susquehanna
watershed
was
becoming
saturated
.

By
Wednesday
,
June
00
,
tropical
storm
Agnes
arrived
and
was
hovering
over
the
Susquehanna
watershed
,
dropping
up
to
of
rain
upstream
in
a
single
day
.

All
around
the
valley
,
signs
of
trouble
loomed
:
Main
Street
in
Shavertown
flooded
,
Harvey
's
Lake
overflowed
,
Hunstville
Dam
was
full
,
a
bridge
washed
out
in
Towanda
.

But
meanwhile
,
at
Wilkes-Barre
the
river
height
was
only
above
the
low
water
level
.

Nevertheless
,
by
00:00
pm
that
night
the
river
had
quietly
risen
to
,
causing
Civil
Defense
Headquarters
in
the
Luzerne
County
Courthouse
to
evacuate
.

Plymouth
residents
were
ordered
to
leave
their
homes
by
0:00
am
.

By
early
morning
Thursday
,
June
00
,
a
widespread
evacuation
of
the
valley
's
flood
zone
was
underway
.

At
0:00
am
,
water
poured
through
a
dike
at
Plymouth
,
and
one
hour
later
the
river
reached
a
height
of
,
rapidly
approaching
the
limit
of
the
valley
's
dike
system
.

Countless
volunteers
passed
sandbags
from
hand
to
hand
in
a
futile
effort
to
raise
the
dike
level
and
hold
back
the
water
,
until
at
00:00
am
,
Civil
Defense
sounded
the
alarm
calling
a
halt
to
all
efforts
on
the
east
side
.

At
0:00
pm
,
water
came
over
the
dike
at
Forty
Fort
,
after
which
work
stopped
on
the
west
side
as
well
.

Telephones
no
longer
worked
,
electricity
was
no
longer
available
and
sewage
systems
were
incapacitated
.

The
absence
of
refrigeration
led
to
a
shortage
of
food
.

Martial
law
went
into
effect
as
rescue
efforts
got
underway
,
and
thousands
of
volunteers
descended
on
the
valley
to
assist
with
the
rescue
and
then
the
clean-up
.

Meanwhile
,
the
water
rose
higher
and
higher
,
finally
peaking
at
at
0:00
pm
,
Saturday
,
June
00
.

At
its
greatest
extent
the
flood
was
wide
and
long
.

Eventually
,
the
water
receded
,
leaving
behind
00,000
homeless
residents
,
and
acres
of
devastation
and
mud
.

The

Anthracite
Map
,
prepared
as
part
of
the
First
Pennsylvania
Geological
Survey
,
illustrates
Plymouth
's
mines
and
collieries
at
a
moment
of
transition
.

The
Lackawanna
&
Bloomsburg
Railroad
was
largely
completed
and
had
begun
to
replace
the
North
Branch
Canal
as
the
preferred
method
for
shipping
coal
.

In
0000
,
most
mines
in
Plymouth
were
tunnels
driven
into
the
hillside
above
water
level
,
with
one
exception
:
in
0000
,
a
shaft
had
been
sunk
at
the
Patten
Mine
by
experienced
miners
from
England
and
Scotland
.

It
was
the
first
deep
mine
shaft
in
Plymouth
and
the
first
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
...
a
harbinger
of
things
to
come
.

In
0000
,
all
of
Plymouth
's
mines
were
run
by
small
local
operators
.

This
would
soon
change
as
large
corporations
,
some
affiliated
with
railroads
,
began
to
take
control
of
much
of
the
town
's
coal
lands
.

The
larger
firms
would
be
better
able
to
handle
labor
disputes
,
and
had
the
necessary
capital
to
conduct
deep
shaft
mining
and
operate
the
mines
on
a
larger
,
more
efficient
scale
.

The
Susquehanna
Coal
Company
Mines
The
Harvey
MineJameson
Harvey
was
born
in
0000
,
the
son
of
Elisha
Harvey
and
his
wife
,
Rosanna
Jameson
.

Harvey
's
farm
,
about
,
was
located
in
Plymouth
Township
on
the
east
side
of
the
intersection
of
Harvey
's
Creek
and
the
Susquehanna
River
.

In
0000
,
he
built
a
Federal-style
farmhouse
and
barn
,
both
of
which
still
stand
today
greatly
altered
,
on
what
is
now
McDonald
Street
.

By
0000
,
probably
inspired
by
his
neighbor
Freeman
Thomas
's
Grand
Tunnel
coal
mine
,
Harvey
supplemented
his
farm
income
by
constructing
a
coal
tunnel
.

Perhaps
learning
from
Thomas
's
experience
,
Harvey
's
tunnel
was
higher
up
the
hill
,
and
thus
a
shorter
distance
from
the
coal
beds
.

Later
,
Harvey
constructed
one
of
Plymouth
's
first
coal
breaker
s.
His
mine
was
closer
than
any
other
to
the
Nanticoke
Dam
and
the
entrance
to
the
North
Branch
Canal
,
and
when
the
railroad
arrived
,
it
ran
right
across
Harvey
's
property
.

These
geographical
advantages
helped
make
the
mine
a
very
successful
venture
.

In
0000
,
Harvey
moved
to
Wilkes-Barre
,
and
in
0000
,
he
sold
his
coal
lands
to
the
Susquehanna
Coal
Co.
,
which
merged
Harvey
's
mine
with
the
Grand
Tunnel
into
a
new
operation
called
the
Susquehanna
Coal
Co.
.

The
Grand
TunnelFreeman
Thomas
was
an
early
land
owner
in
Plymouth
.

In
0000
,
he
acquired
several
patents
for
lots
in
the
lower
end
of
the
township
,
calling
his
estate
"
Harmony
"
,
better
known
in
later
years
as
the
"
Grand
Tunnel
"
.

About
0000
,
Thomas
began
to
dig
a
tunnel
through
solid
rock
into
the
hillside
,
hoping
to
reach
the
famed
Red
Ash
coal
vein
.

He
must
have
succeeded
by
0000
,
for
on
the
0th
of
August
that
year
,
he
petitioned
the
courts
for
the
right
to
build
a
gravity
railroad
from
his
tunnel
to
a
chute
house
along
the
Susquehanna
River
just
above
the
Nanticoke
Dam
.

The
private
railroad
allowed
Thomas
to
ship
his
coal
to
the
iron
forges
in
Danbury
and
to
other
points
south
via
the
newly
built
North
Branch
Canal
.

Thomas
died
in
0000
,
and
in
0000
,
William
L.
Lance
,
Sr.
became
a
tenant
of
Thomas
's
children
.

Lance
operated
the
mine
until
0000
,
when
he
assigned
his
lease
to
the
Mammouth
Vein
Coal
Co.
.

In
January
0000
,
Mammouth
abandoned
Thomas
's
chutehouse
and
built
a
new
one
adjacent
to
the
recently
built
Lackawanna
&
Bloomsburg
railroad
.

In
0000
,
the
Grand
Tunnel
Coal
Co.
operated
the
mine
,
and
in
0000
,
the
New
England
Coal
Co.
operated
the
mine
.

CollieryIn
0000
,
the
Susquehanna
Coal
Company
,
owned
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
took
control
of
both
the
Harvey
Mine
and
the
Grand
Tunnel
,
although
James
Hutchison
stayed
on
as
mine
boss
.

After
a
boiler
explosion
in
0000
,
the
SCC
took
down
the
old
Harvey
breaker
and
by
0000
built
a
new
one
,
considered
to
be
one
of
the
largest
in
the
district
.

The
Chauncey
Colliery
The
Chauncey
Colliery
was
located
between
the
Grand
Tunnel
and
the
Avondale
collieries
.

It
was
one
of
the
few
Plymouth
colleries
to
remain
independent
of
the
large
mining
corporations
.

The
mine
was
named
after
Chauncey
A.
Reynolds
of
Plymouth
who
was
said
to
have
driven
the
first
tunnel
,
probably
in
the
late
0000s
.

The
Chauncey
was
also
known
as
the
Union
Mine
,
and
from
about
0000
to
0000
the
Union
Coal
Co.
,
in
association
with
Charles
Hutchison
,
operated
the
mine
,
working
both
a
shaft
and
a
slope
.

At
the
time
,
capacity
was
about
00,000
tons
per
year
.

From
at
least
0000
until
at
least
0000
,
the
mine
was
operated
by
Roberts
,
Albrighton
&
Co.
,
and
John
Albrighton
,
the
mine
boss
,
employed
about
000
men
.

In
0000
,
a
major
cave
caused
a
stoppage
of
work
at
both
the
Chauncey
and
the
adjacent
Grand
Tunnel
mine
.

In
0000
,
the
mine
was
operated
by
B.
B.
Reynolds
.

In
0000
,
Thomas
P.
MacFarlane
was
the
operator
and
00,000
tons
were
shipped
.

In
0000
,
MacFarlane
still
operated
the
mine
.

By
0000
,
Reynolds
&
Moyer
Coal
Co.
operated
the
Chauncey
.

The
last
operator
of
the
Chauncey
,
George
F.
Lee
,
was
the
son
of
Conrad
Lee
,
from
0000
to
0000
the
outside
foreman
of
the
nearby
Avondale
Colliery
where
George
F.
Lee
was
born
in
0000
.

He
purchased
the
Chauncey
in
0000
,
and
operated
it
as
the
George
F.
Lee
Coal
Co
and
also
ran
a
coal
distribution
center
in
Brooklyn
,
New
York
.

In
0000
,
the
Chauncey
processed
about
0,000
tons
per
month
.

In
0000
,
Lee
built
a
new
breaker
with
a
capacity
of
0,000
tons
daily
,
which
began
operating
on
August
00
.

The
breaker
,
designed
by
Frank
Davenport
,
an
engineer
from
Wilkes-Barre
,
was
destroyed
by
fire
on
January
00
,
0000
,
the
loss
estimated
to
be
$
000,000
.

The
following
day
,
Lee
engaged
E.
E.
Reilly
of
Kingston
to
build
a
new
breaker
.

At
the
end
of
0000
,
the
George
F.
Lee
Coal
Co.
still
worked
both
the
Chauncey
mine
and
breaker
,
producing
00,000
tons
of
coal
,
but
by
0000
,
the
company
was
bankrupt
and
in
receivership
.

The
Avondale
Colliery
In
November
0000
,
Hezekiah
Roberts
,
Jr.
obtained
patents
on
five
lots
in
the
western
end
of
Plymouth
Township
,
about
total
.

He
called
his
estate
"
Avondale
"
,
and
it
eventually
gave
its
name
to
the
colliery
.

After
receiving
these
patents
Roberts
sold
his
soon-to-be
valuable
coal
lands
,
and
by
0000
was
farming
in
Genoa
Township
,
Ohio
.

In
addition
to
Roberts
'
,
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
Railroad
compiled
a
large
number
of
lots
,
including
part
of
Freeman
Thomas
's
Grand
Tunnel
property
.

If
one
includes
the
Wright
family
's
that
comprised
the
Jersey
mine
,
the
DL&W
's
Avondale
holdings
included
over
.

The
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
took
a
circuitous
path
to
ownership
of
Avondale
because
its
0000
charter
limited
its
ownership
of
coal
lands
.

As
a
result
,
it
used
surrogates
to
acquire
coal
properties
.

In
0000
,
John
C.
Phelps
,
a
director
of
the
DL&W
,
leased
a
portion
of
the
Avondale
property
from
William
Reynolds
and
Henderson
Gaylord
,
Plymouth
natives
.

In
0000
,
the
mine
was
transferred
to
the
Steuben
Coal
Co.
,
which
in
turn
became
part
of
the
Nanticoke
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
,
whose
board
of
directors
overlapped
with
the
board
of
the
DL&W
.

The
NC&I
built
the
first
breaker
at
Avondale
.

On
September
0
,
0000
,
the
Avondale
Mine
Disaster
occurred
,
during
which
a
fire
in
the
shaft
,
ignited
by
a
ventilating
furnace
,
spread
to
the
breaker
which
stood
over
the
mine
shaft
.

The
breaker
was
destroyed
by
fire
,
trapping
000
men
and
boys
in
the
mine
below
.

All
were
killed
,
as
were
two
men
who
volunteered
to
enter
the
mine
after
the
fire
.

Soon
after
the
disaster
,
a
second
breaker
was
built
at
the
colliery
.

In
0000
,
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
operated
both
the
mine
and
the
breaker
.

On
February
0
,
0000
,
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
(
successor
to
the
DL&W
)
began
to
dismantle
and
demolish
the
Avondale
breaker
and
to
close
the
mine
.

In
0000
,
no
coal
was
produced
.

However
,
in
December
0000
,
Glen
Alden
resumed
mining
on
a
limited
scale
taking
coal
to
the
Lance
Breaker
to
be
processed
.

The
Jersey
MineThe
Jersey
was
one
of
Plymouth
's
oldest
mines
,
a
tunnel
located
at
the
top
of
Jersey
Road
in
the
hollow
between
Avondale
Hill
and
Curry
Hill
,
just
west
of
the
Plymouth
Borough
boundary
.

The
mine
was
located
on
two
lots
of
about
,
patented
to
Ellen
Wadhams
in
0000
by
virtue
of
the
claim
of
her
late
husband
Moses
Wadhams
.

The
mine
was
established
by
Joseph
Wright
,
Ellen
's
second
husband
,
a
Quaker
who
migrated
to
Plymouth
from
New
Jersey
.

Wright
's
stepdaughter
,
Lydia
Wadhams
,
married
Samuel
French
who
became
the
second
operator
of
the
Jersey
.

French
,
who
was
the
stepson
of
mine
operator
John
Smith
,
operated
the
mine
until
about
0000
,
when
the
Scottish
immigrant
Robert
Love
,
then
a
young
man
in
his
twenties
,
took
control
.

Love
built
a
gravity
railroad
from
the
mine
down
to
the
newly
arrived
Lackawanna
&
Bloomsburg
Railroad
and
supplied
the
L&B
with
the
first
coal
shipped
from
Plymouth
by
rail
.

By
0000
,
the
Jersey
was
operated
by
the
Delaware
Lackawanna
&
Western
Railroad
and
had
an
estimated
annual
capacity
of
00,000
tons
.

In
0000
,
and
in
accordance
with
laws
enacted
following
the
0000
disaster
at
the
adjacent
Avondale
mine
,
the
DL&W
sank
a
X
air
shaft
at
the
Jersey
to
help
ventilate
the
mine
.

A
breaker
sat
on
the
hill
just
below
the
mine
as
early
as
0000
.

The
DL&W
operated
the
Jersey
until
0000
,
when
an
underground
mine
fire
broke
out
.

As
of
0000
,
the
DL&W
's
successor
,
the
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
,
was
still
trying
to
extinguish
the
fire
.

The
Nottingham
Colliery
As
perfected
by
0000
,
the
Nottingham
Colliery
included
the
mines
established
by
Abijah
and
John
Smith
,
and
the
Washington
mine
.

All
four
operations
have
separate
histories
:
Abijah
Smith
's
MineAbijah
Smith
was
born
in
Derby
,
Connecticut
,
about
0000
,
where
he
married
and
fathered
numerous
children
.

He
worked
as
a
blacksmith
or
harness
maker
.

In
0000
,
he
advertised
:
"
For
sale
by
Abijah
Smith
,
at
Derby
Landing
,
Skirting
and
Bridle
leather
,
of
the
first
quality
,
May
0
,
0000
.

It
is
not
known
exactly
why
Smith
left
Derby
for
the
Wyoming
Valley
,
but
one
journalist
reporting
in
0000
related
an
anecdote
that
had
been
passed
down
through
the
years
.
"

The
story
is
that
Abijah
Smith
heard
through
some
man
,
who
had
been
traveling
in
Pennsylvania
,
and
who
passing
through
Derby
on
his
way
home
stopped
at
Smith
's
blacksmith
shop
to
have
his
horse
shod
,
about
black
stone
in
Pennsylvania
that
would
burn
.

The
result
of
this
conversation
was
that
Smith
made
a
trip
to
Pennsylvania
and
eventually
located
there
...
He
left
Derby
in
0000
and
in
0000
mined
00
tons
of
coal
in
Plymouth
,
Pa.
at
the
old
mine
now
rented
to
the
Lehigh
and
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
,
and
known
as
the
Smith
red
ash
coal
.
"

According
to
Hendrick
B.
Wright
,
in
the
fall
of
0000
,
Abijah
Smith
purchased
an
ark
from
John
P.
Arndt
,
a
Wilkes-Barre
merchant
,
which
Arndt
had
used
for
the
transportation
of
plaster
.

Smith
floated
the
ark
from
Wilkes-Barre
to
Plymouth
,
loaded
it
with
about
fifty
tons
of
anthracite
coal
,
and
shipped
it
to
Columbia
,
in
Lancaster
County
.

According
to
Wright
:
"
...
this
was
probably
the
first
cargo
of
anthracite
coal
that
was
ever
ordered
for
sale
in
this
or
any
country
.

The
trade
of
0000
was
fifty
tons
...
Abijah
Smith
therefore
,
of
Plymouth
,
was
the
pioneer
in
the
coal
business
.

Anthracite
coal
had
been
used
before
0000
,
in
this
valley
and
elsewhere
,
in
small
quantities
in
furnaces
,
with
an
air
blast
;
but
the
traffic
in
coal
as
an
article
of
general
use
,
was
commenced
by
Abijah
Smith
,
of
Plymouth
.
"

John
Smith
's
MineIn
0000
,
Hezekiah
Roberts
,
Sr.
obtained
a
patent
for
of
land
,
called
Lot
00
,
on
the
west
side
of
Coal
Creek
,
which
he
sold
to
William
Currie
(
who
gave
the
place
the
name
Curry
Hill
)
.

In
0000
,
Currie
sold
the
mineral
rights
to
Lewis
Hepburn
(
Abijah
's
Smith
's
partner
)
,
and
in
0000
,
Hepburn
sold
half
of
these
rights
to
John
Smith
,
Abijah
's
brother
.

In
0000
,
after
Lewis
Hepburn
died
,
Hepburn
's
son
Patrick
sold
Smith
the
second
half
of
the
coal
rights
.

John
Smith
operated
his
mine
on
the
west
side
of
Coal
Creek
from
0000
until
about
0000
.

A
visitor
in
0000
described
Smith
's
coal
mine
as
having
a
thick
bed
of
coal
,
and
found
the
mine
"
...
extensively
wrought
,
and
the
scene
both
without
and
within
is
exceedingly
imposing
.

The
bed
is
followed
into
the
mountain
,
large
pillars
of
coal
being
left
to
support
the
superincumbent
weight
...
"
The
visitor
noted
that
in
some
areas
Smith
had
removed
all
of
the
coal
,
leaving
only
a
roof
of
slate
which
then
caved
in
.

As
a
result
,
Smith
modified
his
technique
to
leave
two
feet
of
coal
to
form
the
ceiling
.

In
0000
,
John
Smith
leased
his
coal
beds
to
his
son
,
Francis
J.
Smith
,
his
stepson
,
Samuel
French
,
and
his
sons-in-law
,
Draper
Smith
and
William
C.
Reynolds
.

In
0000
,
Smith
sold
the
coal
rights
to
Lot
00
outright
to
Reynolds
.

Washington
CollieryThe
Washington
Colliery
was
first
opened
by
John
Shay
about
0000
.

Shay
built
a
drift
,
an
inclined
plane
,
and
a
breaker
.

Shutz
,
Shay
&
Heebner
operated
the
colliery
until
August
0000
,
when
they
sold
their
rights
to
Broderick
,
Conyngham
&
Co.
.

At
the
same
time
,
BC&C
entered
into
leases
to
operate
the
Nottingham
Colliery
,
the
old
John
Smith
mine
and
the
old
Abijah
Smith
mine
,
and
from
then
on
all
four
mines
were
operated
under
common
management
.

On
April
0
,
0000
BC&C
sold
their
lease
to
the
Lehigh
Navigation
&
Coal
Co.
,
and
on
January
0
,
0000
,
the
LN&C
sold
to
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
which
operated
the
mine
as
the
Reynolds
No.
00
.

By
April
0000
,
the
first
breaker
had
been
dismantled
and
a
new
breaker
was
in
operation
.

In
0000
,
the
L&W
-
B
abandoned
the
second
breaker
and
began
to
process
coal
from
the
Washington
mine
at
the
Nottingham
breaker
.

In
March
0000
,
the
company
destroyed
the
Washington
breaker
with
dynamite
.

Nottingham
CollieryThe
Nottingham
Coal
Co.
of
Baltimore
was
incorporated
on
March
00
,
0000
,
and
obtained
a
lease
to
mine
coal
from
Plymouth
's
Reynolds
family
,
a
lease
which
would
bring
the
family
great
wealth
.

Bryce
R.
Blair
was
named
superintendent
,
and
proceeded
to
construct
a
coal
breaker
and
a
shaft
,
said
to
pass
through
of
quicksand
on
its
way
to
the
coal
beds
below
.

In
August
0000
,
the
Nottingham
assigned
their
lease
to
the
firm
of
Broderick
,
Conyngham
Co.
.

In
order
to
create
a
second
means
of
egress
from
the
mine
,
as
required
by
the
mine
safety
law
enacted
after
the
0000
Avondale
mine
disaster
,
BC&C
drove
to
the
west
to
connect
with
its
Washington
mine
.

On
April
0
,
0000
BCC
sold
their
lease
to
the
Lehigh
Navigation
&
Coal
Co.
,
and
on
January
0
,
0000
,
the
LN&C
sold
to
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
which
operated
the
mine
as
the
Nottingham
No.
00
Colliery
.

In
0000
,
the
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
operated
the
Nottingham
and
produced
000,000
tons
of
coal
.

However
,
in
August
0000
,
Glen
Alden
demolished
the
Nottingham
breaker
,
part
of
a
general
consolidation
of
mine
operations
in
the
Wyoming
Valley
.

Thenceforth
,
coal
from
the
Nottingham
was
processed
at
the
Lance
breaker
.

Interestingly
,
the
lone
voice
of
protest
of
the
Nottingham
's
demise
was
the
Luzerne
County
Communist
Party
,
whose
presidential
candidate
,
Earl
Browder
,
called
upon
the
community
to
raise
its
voice
against
"
this
wrecking
plan
of
the
coal
companies
.
"

In
December
0000
,
Glen
Alden
operated
the
Nottingham
for
the
first
time
since
the
breaker
's
demolition
,
and
after
a
subsequent
period
of
idleness
,
resumed
operations
at
the
Nottingham
again
in
0000
.

The
mine
continued
to
operate
into
the
0000s
.

In
June
0000
,
Charles
Medura
was
killed
in
the
mine
by
a
fall
of
rock
,
the
last
of
many
fatalities
at
the
mine
.

The
Parrish
Colliery
The
Parrish
Colliery
was
a
relative
late-comer
to
Plymouth
.

Its
origins
can
be
traced
to
the
sale
by
the
Wadhams
family
of
their
homestead
farm
in
0000
to
the
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
.

The
property
was
located
in
the
center
of
Plymouth
Borough
,
between
Academy
and
Girard
streets
.

In
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
became
part
of
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
,
which
acquired
the
property
,
but
by
some
arrangement
the
mine
was
operated
by
the
Parrish
Coal
Co.
,
organized
in
0000
.

The
company
built
a
breaker
,
said
to
be
"
a
model
of
neatness
,
"
built
by
contractor
Joseph
C.
Tyrrell
and
completed
in
September
0000
.

On
the
night
of
January
00
,
0000
,
the
new
breaker
caught
fire
and
was
completely
destroyed
.

Another
was
built
and
was
operating
by
July
.

By
0000
,
the
mine
had
reverted
to
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
which
operated
a
washery
and
breaker
.

Ash
and
waste
water
from
the
washery
were
flushed
into
the
Susquehanna
River
.

In
June
0000
,
the
company
closed
the
Parrish
breaker
and
began
construction
of
a
tunnel
under
the
river
to
transport
coal
to
the
company
's
breaker
in
Buttonwood
.

In
0000
,
the
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
acquired
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
,
including
the
Parrish
Colliery
,
and
in
July
of
that
year
the
breaker
blew
down
in
a
wind
and
rain
storm
.

The
Dodson
Colliery
The
Dodson
Colliery
was
located
at
Bull
Run
in
Plymouth
Borough
,
and
its
breaker
stood
alongside
the
tracks
of
the
Lackawanna
&
Bloomsburg
Railroad
.

The
Dodson
's
coal
lands
ran
from
Center
Avenue
on
the
west
to
Pierce
Street
on
the
east
,
and
thus
the
Dodson
's
mining
operations
took
place
beneath
the
central
business
district
of
the
Borough
.

The
colliery
was
first
developed
by
Fellows
&
Dodson
,
Co.
,
beginning
in
0000
,
and
by
0000
a
large
breaker
had
been
built
and
a
shaft
sunk
to
a
depth
of
.

By
0000
,
the
mine
was
operated
by
the
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
which
had
recently
gained
control
of
nearly
all
of
Plymouth
Borough
's
coal
lands
east
of
Academy
Street
,
including
the
Lance
and
the
Gaylord
collieries
.

In
0000
,
the
company
employed
00
men
at
the
Dodson
,
sank
the
shaft
to
a
depth
of
,
and
began
to
experience
problems
with
water
infiltration
.

In
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
merged
into
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
,
but
by
early
0000
this
firm
was
overextended
and
(
temporarily
)
in
receivership
.

In
0000
,
the
Plymouth
Coal
Company
,
managed
by
John
J.
Shonk
and
John
C.
Haddock
,
gained
control
of
the
Dodson
.

In
October
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
Times
reported
that
"
work
is
to
be
resumed
at
the
Dodson
shaft
by
the
Plymouth
Coal
Co.
"
In
0000
,
Haddock
assumed
sole
control
of
the
Plymouth
Coal
Co.
,
and
ran
the
Dodson
until
his
death
in
New
York
in
December
0000
.

Haddock
had
a
litigious
reputation
due
to
his
disputes
with
neighboring
mines
,
with
Plymouth
Borough
and
with
Plymouth
's
Sweitzer
family
.

He
disputed
freight
rates
,
testifying
before
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
that
the
railroads
discriminated
against
small
operators
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
the
first
Dodson
breaker
burned
down
,
and
on
March
0
,
0000
,
work
began
on
the
second
breaker
.

In
0000
,
Plymouth
Borough
obtained
an
injunction
preventing
the
Plymouth
Coal
Co.
from
mining
,
owing
to
surface
subsidence
,
and
for
most
of
that
year
the
mine
was
idle
.

In
January
0000
,
the
Kingston
Coal
Co.
,
which
operated
the
adjacent
Gaylord
Colliery
,
announced
it
would
buy
the
Dodson
mine
.

The
Lance
Colliery
In
his
will
of
0000
,
Jacob
Gould
bequeathed
to
his
seven
children
"
all
the
coal
mines
which
are
now
or
may
hereafter
be
found
on
any
part
of
my
landed
property
...
and
that
there
shall
be
a
reserve
made
in
the
division
of
my
real
or
landed
property
sufficient
for
all
necessary
roads
to
go
to
and
from
said
coal
mines
and
sufficient
land
for
to
deposite
all
coal
and
coal
dirt
and
the
like
that
is
necessary
,
and
that
each
one
shall
have
an
equal
right
to
dig
or
mine
coal
at
anytime
,
and
each
one
shall
be
at
their
proper
expense
of
keeping
said
coal
mine
or
mines
in
repair
according
to
what
coal
they
may
dig
or
mine
.
"

He
further
willed
that
with
respect
to
"
the
division
of
all
my
coal
mines
...
each
daughter
is
made
equal
to
each
son
and
holding
equal
rights
&
interest
...
"
Twenty-four
years
later
,
the
0000
Pennsylvania
Geological
Survey
reported
that
"
coal
has
been
wrought
languidly
for
thirty
years
"
at
"
Gould
and
Shunk
's
mine
,
"
the
operator
being
John
Jenks
Shonk
,
and
the
mine
called
Rudmandale
,
located
just
west
of
Shupp
's
Creek
.

The
small
operation
eventually
became
the
Lance
Colliery
,
one
of
Wyoming
Valley
's
largest
and
most
enduring
.

Despite
its
name
,
the
Lance
Colliery
was
controlled
by
William
L.
Lance
,
Sr.
for
a
very
short
time
.

About
0000
,
Lance
and
his
sons
bought
the
Gould
Homestead
,
which
ran
from
the
Susquehanna
River
to
State
Street
,
just
east
of
the
Plymouth
Borough
line
.

The
land
contained
about
of
coal
measures
.

In
order
to
develop
the
property
by
sinking
a
deep
shaft
to
reach
the
coal
seams
,
and
building
a
breaker
to
process
the
coal
,
Lance
borrowed
money
from
Payne
Pettebone
,
a
coal
mine
operator
.

Lance
overextended
himself
,
and
Pettebone
aggressively
pursued
repayment
.

In
January
0000
,
Lance
's
friend
,
Samuel
Bonnell
,
Jr.
,
bought
the
property
at
Sheriff
's
Sale
so
as
to
satisfy
the
debt
.

Bonnell
allowed
Lance
and
his
sons
to
continue
to
operate
the
mine
.

As
of
0000
,
Lance
had
sunk
the
shaft
,
and
was
in
process
of
sinking
a
second
shaft
for
emergency
egress
.

However
,
in
July
0000
,
Bonnell
sold
the
improvements
and
leased
the
coal
rights
to
the
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
,
and
in
February
0000
,
Bonnell
sold
the
property
outright
to
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
.

Lance
,
who
moved
to
Philadelphia
and
became
a
mat
manufacturer
,
spent
years
in
court
,
suing
his
old
friend
Bonnell
in
a
futile
attempt
to
recover
the
mine
.

According
to
The
Engineering
and
Mining
Journal
,
in
0000
the
Lance
Colliery
was
operated
by
Charles
Parrish
&
Co.
,
a
subsidiary
or
tenant
of
the
L&W
-
B.
The
journal
reported
that
"
the
mine
having
been
idle
for
about
a
year
,
has
again
been
started
up
.
"

In
0000
,
William
Lance
's
old
breaker
was
torn
down
and
on
June
00
,
0000
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
began
building
a
new
breaker
.

In
0000
,
the
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
,
successor
to
the
L&W
-
B
,
erected
a
third
breaker
.

By
this
time
,
large
coal
companies
were
more
concerned
about
their
public
image
,
and
Glen
Alden
made
an
effort
to
make
the
building
and
grounds
attractive
.

Writing
in
0000
,
a
newspaper
reporter
described
the
colliery
as
"
beautifully
landscaped
.
"

In
0000
,
Glen
Alden
produced
000,000
tons
of
coal
,
and
in
0000
produced
000,000
tons
of
coal
.

The
Gaylord
Colliery
The
Gaylord
was
opened
about
0000
by
Henderson
Gaylord
,
who
built
a
private
railroad
from
the
colliery
across
what
was
then
the
Nesbit
family
farm
to
a
wharf
on
the
river
near
the
corner
of
Gaylord
Avenue
and
Main
Street
.

Gaylord
leased
the
mine
to
Van
Homer
&
Fellows
,
then
to
Eric
L.
Hedstrum
(
of
Buffalo
,
New
York
)
.

In
0000
,
J.
Langdon
&
Co.
(
later
H.S.
Mercur
&
Co.
)
operated
the
mine
.

Beginning
in
0000
,
the
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
and
then
its
successor
,
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
,
operated
the
mine
,
but
this
firm
fell
into
receivership
in
0000
and
lost
their
lease
.

The
Gaylord
Coal
Co.
,
operated
by
Thomas
Beaver
and
Daniel
Edwards
,
took
control
of
the
Gaylord
,
and
later
merged
with
the
Kingston
Coal
Co.
.

On
March
0
,
0000
,
the
breaker
at
the
Gaylord
was
destroyed
by
fire
.

In
August
0000
,
The
Engineering
and
Mining
Journal
wrote
,
"
the
Gaylord
Coal
Co.
is
building
a
new
breaker
in
place
of
the
one
burned
down
last
summer
,
and
which
is
to
prepare
the
coal
from
the
old
slope
workings
,
with
its
tunnel
to
the
seven
foot
seam
,
as
well
as
the
coal
from
its
new
shaft
which
was
sunk
by
the
Lehigh
&
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
,
when
it
had
it
,
to
the
Bennett
seam
.

The
new
firm
contemplates
sinking
down
through
the
Bennett
to
the
Red
Ash
seam
.

The
coals
from
the
Seven
Foot
and
the
Red
Ash
will
cause
it
to
be
a
very
fine
colliery
.
"

The
prediction
proved
accurate
:
in
0000
,
the
Gaylord
shaft
and
slope
mined
000,000
tons
of
coal
.

On
February
00
,
0000
,
the
Scranton
Republican
reported
a
large
cave-in
at
the
Gaylord
mine
:
"
We
are
called
upon
to
detail
the
awful
scenes
of
another
miner
horror
.

Thirteen
men
who
went
down
to
repair
some
damaged
work-lugs
in
the
Gaylord
slope
at
Plymouth
are
caught
by
a
fall
of
coal
and
most
probably
called
to
the
great
beyond
,
their
bodies
crushed
and
very
little
hope
entertained
for
their
recovery
for
days
to
come
.
"

On
February
00
,
The
Wilkes-Barre
Record
reported
one
hundred
men
were
digging
for
the
entombed
miners
.

Despite
these
efforts
,
the
situation
was
hopeless
.

On
February
00
the
Wilkes-Barre
Record
reported
that
ground
water
in
the
Gaylord
was
hindering
the
rescue
.

Finally
on
March
00
the
body
of
Peter
McLaughlin
was
recovered
,
the
first
of
the
miners
to
be
found
.

By
April
0
,
the
last
of
the
bodies
was
taken
out
of
the
mine
,
that
of
the
foreman
,
Thomas
Picton
.

According
to
the
Water
Supply
Commission
of
Pennsylvania
,
in
0000
the
colliery
was
still
operated
by
the
Kingston
Coal
Co.
,
preparing
about
000
tons
of
coal
per
day
.

Slush
and
waste
water
were
pumped
into
three
boreholes
,
rather
than
into
Brown
's
Creek
,
and
washwater
was
pumped
from
the
Susquehanna
River
,
00,000,000
gallons
in
four
months
.

In
May
0000
,
the
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
bought
the
Gaylord
mine
from
the
Kingston
Coal
Co.
for
$
000,000
.

Glen
Alden
paid
about
$
00,000
in
back
taxes
owed
to
Plymouth
Township
,
Plymouth
Borough
and
Larksville
Borough
.

It
was
around
this
time
that
the
second
Gaylord
breaker
was
demolished
with
dynamite
.

By
this
time
,
the
mine
was
largely
depleted
,
but
in
December
0000
,
the
Sunday
Independent
reported
that
"
the
old
Gaylord
mine
,
now
being
operated
by
Samuel
Bird
,
brother
of
Morgan
Bird
,
is
showing
signs
of
being
able
to
absorb
additional
number
of
men
in
the
future
...

"

In
0000
,
the
Gaylord
worked
000
days
and
produced
00,000
tons
of
coal
.

In
January
0000
,
the
Bird
Mining
Co.
stopped
mining
at
the
Gaylord
.

Hillside
Colliery
Hillside
was
a
minor
operation
first
worked
by
George
W.
Shonk
and
John
Barry
,
operating
as
the
Barry
,
Shonk
&
Dooley
Coal
Co.
,
perhaps
on
land
owned
by
the
Barry
family
,
old
settlers
on
Plymouth
Mountain
east
of
Poke
Hollow
.

Coal
was
extracted
by
means
of
a
slope
dug
into
the
side
of
the
mountain
.

According
to
the
newspapers
,
in
November
0000
,
the
colliery
began
"
mining
on
a
large
scale
"
and
a
"
breaker
...
erected
which
has
a
capacity
of
several
hundred
tons
daily
.
"

In
0000
,
Shonk
and
Barry
sold
their
interest
in
the
mine
to
Bright
Coal
Co.
,
owned
by
a
group
of
investors
from
Scranton
.

The
newspapers
reported
that
mining
operations
would
be
"
carried
out
on
a
much
larger
scale
"
than
before
.

In
0000
,
Bright
Coal
Co.
still
operated
the
Hillside
.

At
the
time
,
waste
water
from
the
mine
was
dumped
into
a
tributary
of
Brown
's
Creek
.

In
0000
,
Bright
mined
00,000
tons
.

Delaware
&
Hudson
Collieries
Along
Brown
's
Creek
Fuller
's
Shaft
(
Delaware
&
Hudson
No.
0
)
The
former
railroad
crossing
at
Plymouth
's
Bull
Run
(
long
disappeared
)
was
originally
called
Fuller
's
Crossing
,
after
the
mine
operator
J.
C.
Fuller
.

The
railroad
ran
from
his
mine
(
and
several
others
)
,
crossed
Main
Street
and
continued
down
to
a
wharf
on
the
Susquehanna
River
.

Fuller
's
mine
was
located
just
above
the
Gaylord
colliery
along
what
is
now
Washington
Avenue
.

According
to
Munsell
,
the
shaft
was
sunk
by
the
(
old
)
Plymouth
Coal
Co.
and
J.
C.
Fuller
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Fuller
operated
the
mine
,
which
produced
00,000
tons
of
coal
,
making
it
that
year
the
fourth
largest
mine
in
the
Plymouth
district
.

In
0000
,
operation
of
the
mine
was
transferred
from
Fuller
to
the
Northern
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
,
a
firm
owned
by
the
Delaware
&
Hudson
Canal
Co.
.

and
by
0000
,
if
not
earlier
,
a
breaker
was
operating
at
the
mine
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
No.
0
breaker
burned
to
the
ground
,
causing
an
"
awe
inspiring
spectacle
.
"

At
the
time
,
the
breaker
had
been
abandoned
by
the
D&H
and
was
being
used
as
a
washery
by
the
Rissinger
Bros.
.

By
0000
,
a
second
breaker
was
built
,
intended
to
process
coal
from
several
D
&
H
mines
.

In
0000
,
The
D&H
was
operating
both
the
breaker
and
a
washery
and
waste
water
from
these
was
dumped
into
Shupp
's
Creek
,
not
Brown
's
Creek
,
suggesting
that
the
breaker
may
have
been
relocated
from
its
original
site
to
a
new
one
farther
south
.

In
0000
,
fire
destroyed
the
second
No.
0
breaker
.

That
year
,
a
new
reinforced
concrete
breaker
,
called
the
Loree
No.
0
Breaker
,
was
built
to
process
coal
from
all
of
the
D&H
operations
in
Plymouth
.

Swetland
Shaft
(
Delaware
&
Hudson
No.
0
)
The
Swetland
Shaft
was
located
on
the
northwest
corner
of
the
intersection
of
Vine
and
State
streets
in
the
Poke
Hollow
section
of
what
is
now
Larksville
Borough
.

According
to
court
records
,
William
Patten
and
Thomas
Fender
established
this
mine
in
0000
.

About
0000
,
Patten
and
Fender
contracted
with
an
English
immigrant
,
John
Dennis
(
a
future
Plymouth
burgess
)
,
to
sink
a
shaft
to
the
coal
seams
below
.

It
was
said
to
be
the
first
mine
shaft
on
the
west
side
of
the
Susquehanna
River
.

In
January
0000
,
William
Patten
died
when
he
fell
down
the
newly
constructed
shaft
.

Fender
continued
to
operate
the
mine
,
but
on
February
00
,
0000
,
lost
the
property
at
sheriff
's
sale
.

Josiah
W.
Eno
built
a
breaker
at
the
mine
in
0000
,
which
he
operated
until
0000
.

A.C.
Laning
&
Co.
bought
the
mine
,
and
subsequently
John
Jenks
Shonk
,
Payne
Pettebone
and
William
Swetland
bought
the
mine
.

In
0000
,
J.
Langdon
&
Co.
operated
the
mine
.

According
to
Samuel
L.
French
,
David
Levi
,
a
Welshman
,
operated
the
mine
,
followed
by
A.J.
Davis
and
Charles
Bennett
.

By
0000
,
J.C.
Fuller
operated
the
mine
,
and
in
0000
,
the
Northern
Coal
&
Iron
Co.
,
a
subsidiary
of
the
Delaware
&
Hudson
Canal
Co.
,
assumed
operation
of
the
mine
.

Michael
Shonk
was
mine
boss
for
both
Fuller
and
the
NC&I
.

By
0000
,
a
coal
breaker
stood
on
the
site
,
and
in
0000
,
the
D&H
dismantled
the
breaker
.

As
of
0000
,
coal
from
the
No.
0
shaft
was
hauled
to
the
No.
0
breaker
for
processing
,
although
a
washery
at
the
No.
0
prepared
enough
coal
to
run
the
colliery
boilers
.

As
of
0000
,
the
D&H
continued
to
operate
the
mine
,
calling
it
the
Loree
No.
0
.

Delaware

Hudson
Collieries
Along
Shupp
's
Creek
Boston
CollieryThe
Boston
was
unique
in
that
the
mine
and
the
breaker
were
originally
built
about
0-0/0
miles
apart
from
one
another
.

The
mine
and
shaft
were
located
north
of
State
Street
where
it
intersects
with
Shupp
's
Creek
.

A
railroad
was
built
from
the
mine
along
the
creek
down
to
the
first
Boston
breaker
,
located
next
to
and
east
of
the
old
Shupp
Cemetery
at
the
bottom
of
Boston
Hill
.

The
mine
was
opened
in
0000
by
the
Boston
Coal
Co.
,
which
leased
to
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
Railroad
Co.
in
0000
,
and
sold
to
the
Delaware
&
Hudson
Canal
Co.
in
0000
,
subject
to
the
lease
of
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
mined
0,000
tons
,
but
in
January
that
year
the
Delaware
&
Hudson
assumed
operation
of
the
mine
.

On
January
00
,
0000
,
the
Boston
breaker
burned
and
was
totally
destroyed
.

The
Delaware
&
Hudson
built
a
second
breaker
,
this
time
adjacent
to
the
mine
.

It
was
completed
by
November
0000
.

In
0000
,
the

was
demolished
and
coal
from
the

.

By
0000
,
the
NC&I
operated
a

Colliery
The
Woodward
Colliery
was
located
on
the
eastern
slope
of
Ross
Hill
up-hill
from
Toby
's
Creek
.

With
of
coal
lands
,
it
was
a
major
colliery
,
and
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
&
Western
Railroad
took
several
years
to
establish
it
.

In
0000
,
in
what
was
then
Plymouth
Township
,
the
DL&W
began
to
sink
two
shafts
,
the
largest
of
which
(
at
00
X
00
feet
)
was
sunk
to
the
Red
Ash
coal
vein
.

By

,
the
DL&W
had
begun
to
construct
a
breaker
and
to
prepare
railroad
beds
for
a
branch
line
connecting
the
breaker
to
the
DL&W
's
railroad
line
on

and
to
fill
in
part
of
Toby
's
Creek
so
as
to
straighten
the
railroad
bed
leading
to
the
breaker
.

By
0000
,
the
new
breaker
was
under
construction
.

The
foundation
was
built
by
Curtis
Construction
Co.
of
New
York
,
and
the
steel
frame
built
by
the
DL&W
.

The
facade
of
the
breaker
was
clad
with
special
high-strength
wire
glass
.

The
new
colliery
had
its
own
power
plant
fueled
by
coal
from
the
mine
.

In

,
the
Glen
Alden
Coal
Co.
,

,
operated
the
Woodward

tons
of
coal

History
Early
history
The
first
white
settlers
that
came
to
Shickshinny
were
the
Austin
family
and
Crossley
family
who
came
from
Connecticut
.

According
to
a
Suburban
News
article
,
the
first
permanent
settler
in
the
area
was
Ralph
Austin
.

This
was
the
period
of
Connecticut
jurisdiction
of
0000
.

For
a
brief
time
,
the
Austin
family
fled
back
to
Connecticut
during
the
Battle
of
Wyoming
.

They
set
up
a
farm
and
an
inn
.

In
0000
,
Shadrick
Austin
bought
the
of
land
.

Other
known
settlers
in
the
area
were
William
Koons
as
early
as
0000
.

Koons
settled
one
mile
from
Shickshinny
where
the
Shickshinny
Creek
bridge
was
created
.

The
name
of
the
area
was
changed
to
Koonsville
when
the
post
office
was
established
.

Nathan
Beach
,
also
from
Connecticut
,
settled
in
0000
.

The
area
was
named
Beach
Haven
after
him
.

The
farm
,
which
encompassed
nearly
the
entire
current-day
borough
,
later
came
into
possession
of
Matthias
Hollenbeck
under
the
Pennsylvania
claim
.

The
land
was
then
inherited
by
his
daughter
,
Cist
Hollenback
,
who
married
Chester
Butler
.

In
0000
,
upon
C.
Hollenbeck
's
death
,
the
land
was
divided
and
sold
to
the
proprietors
of
the
Shickshinny
company
:
George
W.
Search
,
Lot
Search
,
Nathan
Beach
Crary
and
Nathan
Garrison
.

Walter
Garrison
bought
the
corner
that
the
modern-day
bank
stands
on
.

Lot
Search
held
the
position
of
Luzerne
County
treasurer
in
0000
and
maintained
it
for
two
years
.

N.
Garrison
and
Andrew
J.
Eldon
built
the
first
store
,
located
outside
the
old
storehouse
,
in
June
0000
.

But
a
few
months
after
the
store
opened
,
Eldon
fled
to
China
with
$
0,000
of
Garrison
's
money
.

It
was
reported
that
Eldon
was
lost
in
a
storm
at
sea
and
drowned
from
the
weight
of
gold
in
his
pockets
.

The
business
soon
closed
and
was
bought
by
Nathan
B.
Crary
.

A
drug
store
opened
at
the
same
time
,
built
by
Jacob
Cist
,
and
run
and
managed
by
Stephen
Bond
.

Shickshinny
Borough
was
organized
November
00
,
0000
.

It
was
taken
from
Salem
Township
and
Union
Township
,
the
majority
(
two-thirds
)
being
from
Union
.

The
first
officers
were
Burgess
and
Enke
.

The
counsel
was
composed
of
Search
,
Koons
,
Crary
,
Nicely
,
and
Davenport
.

G.
W.
Search
became
the
secretary
,
while
Slippy
became
supervisor
.

Second
was
Burgess
,
third
Knor
,
fourth
Youlls
,
fifth
Bear
,
sixth
Post
,
seventh
Hughes
,
eight
Hartman
and
ninth
Bulkley
.

Nathan
Garrison
was
the
first
of
the
proprietors
to
die
in
0000
,
survived
by
wife
and
children
.

Many
businesses
began
to
spring
up
in
the
next
decade
,
including
a
flour
mill
set
up
by
G.
W.
and
Lot
Search
in
0000
,
a
foundry
set
up
by
Jesse
Beadle
,
L.
T.
Hartman
and
Frederick
Beach
in
0000
,
and
a
planing
mill
set
up
by
Amos
Hess
in
0000
.

Two
blacksmith
shops
were
also
built
and
run
by
Miner
Brown
and
Henry
Wagner
.

The
first
newspaper
in
the
area
,
The
Mountain
Echo
,
was
first
issued
in
0000
,
established
by
C.
A.
Boone
and
M.
E.
Walker
.

A
post
office
began
in
the
Search
store
,
and
in
the
0000s
was
moved
.

Lot
Search
was
said
to
believe
that
at
one
point
Shickshinny
was
the
meeting
point
of
over
00,000
farmers
to
ship
their
goods
.

Shickshinny
was
a
central
hub
for
many
reasons
.

A
toll
bridge
was
built
in
0000
to
Mocanaqua
,
the
first
of
three
up
to
0000
.

An
0000
turnpike
was
built
along
the
creek
,
heading
towards
Huntington
Mills
(
modern-day
Route
000
)
,
and
an
0000
turnpike
ran
to
Berwick
and
to
Elmira
,
New
York
.

The
canal
ran
along
the
river
and
by
0000
was
built
to
Nanticoke
.

This
gave
Shickshinny
the
advantages
of
both
a
railroad
and
a
canal
,
which
was
built
through
in
0000
.

Shickshinny
was
the
international
headquarters
of
the
Sovereign
Order
of
St
John
of
Jerusalem
or
Shickshinny
Knights
of
Malta
.

The
George
W.
Search
House
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Coal
Shickshinny
is
located
at
the
lower
end
of
the
Wyoming
Valley
Coal
Deposit
,
near
a
Red
Ash
vein
that
runs
across
the
Susquehanna
River
near
Mocanaqua
.

Humphrey
Davenport
was
employed
in
0000
to
prospect
Nathan
Beach
's
land
.

He
soon
discovered
coal
on
Rocky
Mountain
.

For
the
next
decade
the
coal
was
brought
off
the
mountain
by
teams
.

Finally
in
0000
Beach
's
grandson
,
Dr.
Darwin
Crary
,
invented
the
first
inclined
chute
to
be
used
for
the
coal
industry
,
which
sent
coal
to
the
canal
down
the
mountain
.

Two
years
later
,
in
0000
,
James
A.
Gordon
built
a
plane
for
Beach
and
Crary
that
ran
for
several
successful
years
.

The
mines
were
passed
over
to
Truman
H.
Clark
,
and
then
in
0000
John
M.
Stackhouse
and
Matthew
Wier
purchased
the
mines
.

In
0000
Cyrus
Stackhouse
bought
out
Wier
's
stock
.

Again
in
0000
the
mines
exchanged
hands
and
were
bought
by
the
Paxton
Coal
Company
.

Finally
in
0000
the
Salem
Coal
Company
was
formed
.

Under
their
guidance
the
mines
produced
00,000
tones
and
employed
just
short
of
000
men
and
boys
.

Newport
Mountain
provided
coal
as
well
.

It
sits
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
Susquehanna
River
and
was
found
to
possess
superior
coal
.

In
0000
roads
and
bridges
were
built
to
connect
the
Lackawanna
and
Bloomsburg
Railroad
,
which
lay
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
mine
Newport
Mountain
.

A
company
was
formed
by
Jedediah
Irish
,
Jess
Hart
and
Henry
.

C.
Crary
to
build
the
bridge
.

Construction
was
finished
in
0000
by
Luther
and
William
H.
Trescott
.

In
0000
the
bridge
washed
away
in
a
flood
,
and
was
to
be
rebuilt
by
the
Mocanaqua
Company
.

Neither
the
Shickshinny
nor
Mocanaqua
mines
are
in
service
today
.

Education
The
Northwest
Area
School
District
serves
Shickshinny
,
as
well
as
the
borough
of
New
Columbus
and
the
townships
of
Hunlock
,
Union
,
Huntington
Mills
,
and
Fairmont
.

The
student
body
is
separated
into
primary
,
intermediate
and
junior/senior
high
schools
.

The
Northwest
Area
School
District
formerly
contained
three
elementary
schools
that
contribute
to
the
student
body
of
the
Northwest
Area
High
School
.

These
schools
were
:
Huntington
Mills
Elementary
School
,
Hunlock
Creek
Elementary
School
,
and
Garrison
Elementary
School
,
located
in
downtown
Shickshinny
next
to
Shickshinny
Creek
.

At
the
end
of
the
0000
–
0000
school
year
,
Garrison
Elementary
was
closed
.

Major

"
s
"

cave
in

Anthony
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Anthony
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Lycoming
Township
on
September
0
,
0000
by
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
.

It
is
named
in
honor
of
Joseph
B.
Anthony
who
was
a
judge
in
Lycoming
County
at
the
time
.

When
colonial
settlers
first
arrived
in
what
is
now
Anthony
Township
they
were
outside
the
western
boundary
of
what
was
then
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

These
settlers
were
not
under
the
jurisdiction
or
protection
of
any
type
from
any
of
the
Thirteen
Colonies
.

They
became
known
as
the
Fair
Play
Men
.

These
men
established
their
own
form
of
government
,
known
as
the
"
Fair
Play
System
"
,
with
three
elected
commissioners
who
ruled
on
land
claims
and
other
issues
for
the
group
.

In
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
Fair
Play
Men
made
their
own
Declaration
of
Independence
from
Britain
on
July
0
,
0000
beneath
the
"
Tiadaghton
Elm
"
on
the
banks
of
Pine
Creek
.

A
German
Baptist
congregation
was
incorporated
on
February
0
,
0000
,
under
the
title
of
the
"
German
Baptist
Church
of
Anthony
Township
"
.

It
was
one
of
the
first
German
Baptist
churches
founded
in
America
along
with
two
other
churches
in
Lycoming
County
,
one
on
Blooming
Grove
Road
north
of
Williamsport
and
the
other
in
Fairfield
Township
near
Montoursville
.

These
churches
were
more
commonly
known
as
the
Dunker
or
Dunkard
Churches
for
their
practice
of
immersing
believers
three
times
,
once
in
the
name
of
the
Father
,
once
in
the
name
of
the
Son
,
and
once
in
the
name
of
the
Holy
Spirit
.

A
spur
of
the
plank
road
along
Larrys
Creek
was
built
into
Anthony
Township
,
but
it
is
not
known
how
far
it
extended
.

Armstrong
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
The
first
European
settlers
arrived
in
Armstrong
Township
in
0000
.

Thomas
Hartley
,
Michael
Graybill
,
George
Leffler
,
and
John
Kern
all
received
warrants
for
land
on
February
00
,
0000
.

Hartley
then
purchased
the
properties
of
Graybill
,
Leffler
and
Kern
on
March
00
,
0000
.

This
was
to
avoid
a
Province
of
Pennsylvania
law
that
stated
that
no
one
man
could
purchase
more
than
one
tract
of
land
.

Marcus
Huling
appears
to
have
been
the
first
permanent
settler
in
Mosquito
Valley
,
which
makes
up
the
greatest
portion
of
Armstrong
Township
.

Huling
settled
in
the
eastern
portion
of
Mosquito
Valley
,
near
where
Culbertson
's
Path
crossed
.

Huling
and
family
cleared
land
,
built
a
cabin
,
a
sawmill
,
and
distillery
in
0000
.

Huling
's
son
,
Thomas
,
carried
on
the
family
businesses
until
his
death
.

Interestingly
,
although
the
Huling
's
were
apparently
successful
businessmen
,
they
never
saw
fit
to
settle
their
debt
on
the
land
that
they
had
developed
.

Upon
Thomas
Huling
's
death
,
the
land
was
foreclosed
and
was
left
to
be
reclaimed
by
nature
until
the
arrival
of
German
farmer
s
in
0000
.

Armstrong
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Clinton
Township
in
0000
.

It
is
named
in
honor
of
James
Armstrong
,
a
prominent
lawyer
.

Mosquito
Valley
was
cleared
by
the
lumber
companies
that
made
nearby
Williamsport
the
"
Lumber
Capital
of
the
World
.
"

Lumberjacks
harvested
the
old-growth
forest
s
of
white
pine
and
hemlock
.

They
then
floated
the
logs
down
Mosquito
Run
to
the
sawmills
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
.

As
the
valley
was
cleared
of
trees
,
farmers
moved
into
the
area
and
began
several
successful
orchard
and
dairy
operations
.

Armstrong
Township
is
not
limited
to
Mosquito
Valley
alone
.

Bald
Eagle
Mountain
runs
through
the
northernmost
portions
of
it
.

From
this
ridge
,
several
mountain
streams
find
their
source
.

The
lumber
baron
s
from
Williamsport
flocked
to
Mosquito
Run
in
the
south
and
western
sections
of
the
township
and
to
Hagerman
's
Run
in
the
eastern
portion
of
the
township
.

The
barons
built
summer
cottages
on
both
streams
,
fished
for
trout
in
the
waters
,
and
built
small
dams
for
recreational
swimming
and
ice
skating
.

They
also
built
several
trout
hatcheries
in
Mosquito
Valley
.

The
Williamsport
Municipal
Water
Authority
quickly
saw
the
value
of
the
fresh
water
that
was
in
abundant
supply
in
both
Mosquito
and
Hagerman
's
Runs
.

It
acquired
water
rights
to
the
streams
and
eventually
bought
up
most
of
the
farmland
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
Armstrong
Township
in
the
early
0000s
as
part
of
its
watershed
.

Visitors
to
the
"
water
company
"
lands
can
see
the
stone
remains
of
the
early
settlers
homesteads
spread
throughout
the
watershed
.

This
mass
purchase
of
farmland
in
Armstrong
County
has
accounted
for
the
steep
decline
in
population
since
0000
.

Mosquito
Run
and
Hagerman
's
Run
still
provide
drinking
water
for
Williamsport
.

The
water
authority
built
a
multi-million
dollar
water
filtration
plant
in
the
0000s
in
Mosquito
Valley
.

With
the
construction
of
this
plant
the
lands
of
the
water
authority
were
opened
as
a
nature
preserve
to
the
general
public
.

Creek
divides
the

of
north
central
Pennsylvania
and
in
the
lumber
era
that
swept
through
Pennsylvania
in
the
mid-to-late

Susquehanna
River

"
,
deciding
to
include
it
on
the

's
compilation
album

Leslie
Mathew
,
who
reviewed
the

,
said
:
"
The
songs
may
be
simple
and
the
writing
prone
to
all
clichés
of
the
form
,
but
the
album
boasts
a
pretty
consistent
hard
rock
attack
,
passionate
playing
,
and
a
keen
sense
of
melody

Clinton
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Clinton
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Washington
Township
by
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
during
its
December
0000
sessions
.

It
was
named
for
Governor
DeWitt
Clinton
of
New
York
.

One
of
the
most
prominent
physical
features
in
Clinton
Township
is
Penny
Hill
.

This
hill
which
is
in
the
eastern
portion
of
the
township
was
named
for
a
dog
named
Penny
.

Penny
was
apparently
fond
of
wandering
up
and
down
the
hill
during
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
.

She
was
owned
by
a
man
named
David
Tolbert
.

Tolbert
's
dog
was
seen
so
often
on
the
hill
that
the
residents
of
the
area
began
to
call
it
Penny
Hill
.

Today
Penny
Hill
is
bisected
by
U.S.
Route
00
.

It
overlooks
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
and
is
covered
by
a
number
of
family
residences
and
several
small
farms
.

The
first
permanent
settlers
to
Clinton
Township
arrived
just
before
the
beginning
of
the
American
Revolution
.

They
cleared
the
land
that
surrounds
Black
Hole
Creek
in
the
valley
between
Bald
Eagle
Mountain
and
Penny
Hill
.

During
the
war
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

Following
the
war
the
pioneers
returned
to
Clinton
Township
and
reestablished
their
homesteads
.

By
this
time
most
of
the
Native
Americans
had
either
been
killed
off
or
fled
to
the
west
.

The
settlers
encountered
some
struggles
over
the
years
,
most
notably
in
the
winter
of
0000
.

This
winter
was
especially
harsh
in
Clinton
Township
.

Nearly
all
the
livestock
was
either
frozen
to
death
or
they
died
of
starvation
.

The
supplies
of
food
stored
after
the
harvest
were
quickly
depleted
and
the
people
began
to
starve
.

Hunters
struggled
through
the
deep
snow
.

Even
those
that
were
able
to
use
snowshoes
to
walk
on
top
of
the
snow
struggled
to
find
any
game
,
which
also
struggled
to
survive
the
harsh
winter
.

When
the
winter
finally
broke
the
residents
were
able
to
harvest
tremendous
amounts
of
shad
in
Black
Hole
Creek
and
in
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
with
a
seine
that
was
delivered
to
them
by
the
father-in-law
of
Major
Ten
Brook
,
Mr.
Emmons
.

Mr.
Emmons
arrived
from
New
Jersey
with
additional
supplies
including
salt
,
wheat
,
corn
,
and
garden
seeds
.

He
is
credited
with
saving
the
lives
of
many
of
the
early
residents
of
Clinton
Township
.

Emmons
returned
again
in
0000
with
another
wagon
load
of
supplies
,
while
camping
he
was
killed
by
a
tree
that
fell
on
the
wagon
where
he
was
sleeping
.

Eagle
Grange

in
Clinton
Township
was
organized
on
March

,
0000
by
a
group
of
rural
farmer
s
who
had
become
concerned
about
the
rising
costs
of
farming
in
the
post
Civil
War
economy
.

It
was
the
first
grange
to
be
organized
in
Pennsylvania
,
two
years
before
the
formation
of
the
Pennsylvania
State
Grange
and
four
years
after
The
National
Grange
of
the
Order
of
Patrons
of
Husbandry
,
better
known
as
the
National
Grange
was
founded
in
Fredonia
,
New
York
by
Oliver
Hudson
Kelley
.

The
chief
objectives
of
the
Eagle
Grange
No.

were
the
establishment
of
a
co-operative
purchasing
program
for
farmers
,
the
lowering
of
railroad
rates
,
and
the
establishment
of
rural
free
delivery
by
the
United

Postal
Service
.

The
Grange
was
one
of
the
first
national
organizations
to
give
equal
status
to
female
members
.

,
when
the
last
log
raft
was

Creek
.

Remnants
of
the
lumber
era
can

Duboistown
is
a
borough
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Duboistown
(
pronounced
'
doo-BOYS
town
'
)
is
named
for
its
founders
John
and
Mathias
DuBois
who
bought
of
land
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
DuBois
brothers
divided
their
land
into
parcels
and
established
the
village
that
bears
their
name
.

John
DuBois
left
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
Valley
before
Duboistown
was
established
as
a
borough
.

He
sold
his
business
interests
and
moved
west
to
Clearfield
County
.

He
became
quite
wealthy
and
the
city
of
DuBois
was
named
in
his
honor
.

The
town
built
by
the
DuBois
brothers
and
established
as
a
borough
in
0000
is
by
no
means
the
beginning
of
the
history
of
Duboistown
.

It
is
situated
at
the
mouth
of
Mosquito
Run
on
the
banks
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

A
tribe
of
Susquehannock
Indians
had
what
appears
to
have
been
a
fairly
major
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
.

The
early
European
settlers
found
the
remains
of
an
Indian
village
there
.

Arhaeologic
evidence
of
earthenware
,
soapstone
ware
,
pestles
,
hatchets
,
ornaments
and
charms
were
found
on
the
land
that
is
across
the
river
from
Lycoming
Creek
and
nearby
where
the
Sheshequin
Path
crossed
the
river
.

The
land
on
which
Duboistown
is
located
was
first
surveyed
in
0000
.

At
the
time
it
was
known
as
"
Walnut
Bottom
"
for
the
vast
stands
of
black
walnut
that
covered
the
alluvial
plain
on
which
the
borough
now
stands
.

Samuel
Boone
,
cousin
of
Daniel
Boone
held
the
first
warrant
for
land
at
Walnut
Bottom
.

Andrew
Culbertson
was
one
of
the
first
settlers
to
have
success
in
the
Duboistown
area
.

He
purchased
several
tracts
of
land
beginning
in
0000
,
including
the
parcel
owned
by
Samuel
Boone
,
near
the
mouth
of
Mosquito
Run
.

Culbertson
is
thought
to
have
moved
into
the
area
by
crossing
an
Indian
Trail
over
White
Deer
Mountain
that
is
now
known
as
Culbertson
's
Path
.

He
built
a
sawmill
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
soon
after
moving
to
the
area
and
there
he
lived
for
several
years
.

Culbertson
was
forced
to
flee
the
area
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
when
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Battle
of
Wyoming
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Settlers
abandoned
their
homes
and
fields
,
drove
their
livestock
south
,
and
towed
their
possessions
on
rafts
on
the
river
to
Sunbury
.

Their
abandoned
property
was
burned
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Culbertson
returned
to
the
area
and
rebuilt
his
sawmill
.

He
also
built
a
gristmill
,
distillery
,
and
a
press
that
extracted
nut
and
linseed
oil
s.
His
gristmill
was
especially
important
to
the
development
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
.

It
was
easily
accessible
from
canoe
.

Farmers
could
float
their
grain
in
their
canoes
or
other
watercraft
right
up
to
the
mill
.

Other
farmers
from
the
surrounding
valleys
reached
his
mill
via
Culbertson
's
Path
.

Culbertson
saw
another
business
opportunity
with
the
farmers
who
were
coming
to
his
mill
.

He
quickly
built
a
tavern
in
which
the
weary
farmers
could
enjoy
a
drink
and
get
some
food
while
they
waited
for
their
grain
to
be
ground
into
flour
.

This
tavern
became
a
popular
destination
for
the
young
people
of
the
West
Branch
Valley
.

Today
Culbertson
's
Mill
and
tavern
are
long
gone
and
the
area
is
a
largely
overgrown
riverbank
with
an
abandoned
softball
field
,
that
is
surrounded
by
a
railroad
,
bridge
,
and
woods
.

The
000
block
of
Summer
Street
in
Duboistown
is
decorated
for
Christmas
each
December
and
is
known
as
Candy
Cane
Lane
.

In
0000
,
the
mayor
of
the
borough
proclaimed
the
month
of
"
December
as
Candy
Cane
Lane
month
forever
more
in
DuBoistown
"

,
0000
.

000
votes
for
to
00
against

.

On

,
0000
,

of
C.
D.
Eldred
,
who

.

The

were
mostly
Quakers
,
attracted
by
the
land
speculations
of
Robert
Morris
,
and
others
in
Muncy
Township
.

Among
these
settlers
were
the
Winners
,
Wilsons
,
and

.

The
neighborhood

Warrensville
is
the
only
village
in

township
.

The
story
of
the
origin
of
its
name
is
as
follows
:
In
0000
,
when
there
was
talk
of
applying
for
a
postoffice
,
several
persons
met
in
the
store
of
John
Hoffman
,
on
Mill
creek
,
and
the
question
Warrensville
,
in
honor
of
General
Warren
,
was
proposed
,
of
a
name
came
up
.

while
others
suggested
Livingston
.

A
vote
was
taken
and
Warrensville
carried
.

The
postoffice
was
established
July
00
,
0000
,
named
Warrensville
,
and
Samuel
Torbert
was
appointed
postmaster
.

The
land
on
which
Warrensville
stands
was
cleared
in
0000
by
Samuel
Carpenter
.

He
erected
a
grist
and
saw
mill
and
carding
machine
,
which
were
the
first
improvements
of
the
kind
in
the
settlement
.

They
proved
of
great
service
to
the
early
settlers
.

These
original
works
have
long
since
passed
out
of
existence
.

The
village

residence
of
a
defendant
in

lawsuit
in

Columbia
County
court
session
in
0000
.

John
Andrew
Shulze
retired
to
Fairfield
Township
following

term
as
governor
of

Shulze
bought
in
western
Fairfield
Township
,
now
part
of
Montoursville
for
$
00,000
.

His
plan
was
to
spend
his
retirement
farming
in
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
Valley
.

Shulze
quickly
made
am
impact
in

He
built
a
brick
house
on

donated
an
acre

for
the
construction
of
Union
Church
which
was
shared
by
the
Lutheran
and
Presbyterian
congregations
of
Montoursville

Ultimately
Shulze
's
time
in

failure

attempts
at
farming
were
unsuccessful
.

He
also
lost
a
lawsuit
filed
by
William
Cameron

$
0,000.00
.

Shulze
was
apparently
unable
to
pay
the
suit
and
his
property
was
seized
and
sold
to
pay
his
debt
.

Governor
Shulze
then
took
up
residence
in

,
lost
even
more
lawsuits
and
eventually
moved
to
Lancaster
in

he
lived

Gamble
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical

.

History
Gamble
Township
was
formed
from
parts
of
Lewis
and
Cascade
Townships
on
January
00
,
0000
.

An
election
of
the
citizens
of
the
proposed
township
was
000-0
in
favor
of
its
creation
.

The
drive
for
the
formation
of
Gamble
Township
was
led
Ira
Parker
,
Abraham
Swartz
,
and
J.C.
Green
.

They
started
a
petition
and
gathered
the
necessary
signatures
.

Their
petition
was
presented
to
Judge
James
Gamble
who
authorized
the
election
.

The
results
of
the
balloting
were
certified
by
Judge
Huston
Hepburn
.

The
township
is
named
for
the
judge
who
ordered
the
election
.

The
first
settler

Gamble
Township
was
John
Rose
,

in
0000
.

He
migrated
to
the
United

in
0000
and
settled
in
what

now
Gamble
Township
.

Rose
was
accompanied
to
the
valley
by
is
first
wife
and
a
man
named
Andrew
Tulloh
.

Rose
and
Tulloh
cleared
some
land
for
farming

did
not
remain
in
the
valley
.

They
both
moved
to
Williamsport
in

Township
during

mid-to-late
00th
century
.

Several
salt
mines
were
built
within

.

Thousands
of
acres
of
old-growth
forest
were
cleared
to
meet
the
demands
for
lumber
during
the
lumber
era
that
swept
throughout
Pennsylvania
.

,
which

Hepburn
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Hepburn
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Loyalsock
Township
in
0000
.

It
is
named
for
William
Hepburn
who
was
a
former
state
senator
and
one
of
the
founding
fathers
of
Lycoming
County
and
Williamsport
which
is
the
largest
city
in
Lycoming
County
.

Hepburn
Township
was
originally
much
larger
in
size
than
it
is
today
.

Lewis
,
Gamble
,
Eldred
Township
,
and
Cascade
Townships
all
are
formed
from
territory
that
was
at
least
formerly
part
of
Hepburn
Township
.

An
Indian
village
known
as
Eeltown
played
a
prominent
role
in
the
early
history
of
what
is
now
Hepburn
Township
.

This
village
located
on
Lycoming
Creek
near
the
present
village
of
Hepburnville
was
an
important
village
on
the
Sheshequin
Path
.

The
Indian
name
for
Eeltown
is
unknown
,
but
the
whites
named
it
for
the
plentiful
eels
that
could
be
found
in
the
waters
of
Lycoming
Creek
.

Hepburn
Township
was
settled
by
three
distinct
groups
of
European
migrants
.

The
western
section
along
Lycoming
Creek
was
largely
settled
by
the
Scots-Irish
,
the
middle
section
known
as
Blooming
Grove
was
settled
by
a
German
religious
sect
,
the
Dunkard
Brethren
,
and
the
eastern
section
of
the
township
was
settled
by
the
Quakers
.

John
and
Gottlieb
Heim
were
among
the
first
Dunkards
to
settle
in
Hepburn
Township
.

The
Heims
were
imprisoned
in
Württemberg
,
Germany
as
conscientious
objector
s.
A
condition
of
their
release
from
prison
was
that
they
would
agree
to
leave
Germany
forever
.

Upon
their
release
John
and
Gottleig
moved
to
the
United
States
.

They
settled
in
Lycoming
County
and
founded
a
religious
community
and
village
known
as
Blooming
Grove
.

Soon
other
Dunkards
from
Germany
were
to
join
the
Heim
brothers
.

They
built
log
cabins
and
quickly
cleared
the
land
for
farming
.

In
addition
to
clearing
the
land
the
Dunkards
were
also
free
to
worship
God
in
a
manner
that
they
saw
fit
.

Their
faith
was
banned
in
Germany
.

The
newly
arrived
settlers
worked
hard
to
clear
the
land
and
credited
their
success
on
their
faith
in
God
.

The
new
farms
prospered
almost
immediately
,
they
"
bloomed
like
flowers
"
.

Hence
the
name
Blooming
Grove
.

Balls
Mills
is
a
village
in
Hepburn
Township
.

It
is
named
for
John
Ball
who
migrated
from
England
to
the
United
States
in
0000
.

He
settled
in
Hillsgrove
Township
in
Sullivan
County
.

There
he
built
a
sawmill
and
was
beginning
to
have
success
when
he
drowned
while
bathing
.

His
son
,
William
,
then
moved
west
to
Hepburn
Township
and
founded
Balls
Mills
in
0000
.

He
built
a
fulling
mill
soon
after
building
his
home
.

The
Ball
family
quickly
had
success
and
expanded
their
milling
operations
to
include
a
clover
mill
.

The
machinery
at
the
clover
mill
was
able
to
clean
clover
seed
.

Clover
seed
was
very
expensive
at
the
time
,
a
bushel
of
the
seed
sold
for
as
much
as
$
00.00
.

Clover
was
very
important
to
farmers
for
providing
ground
cover
and
as
a
food
supply
for
their
grazing
dairy
cow
s.
The
Balls
family
also
built
a
sawmill
,
a
wool
en
mill
,
and
a
grain
cradle
manufacturing
operation
.

A
cradle
is
attached
to
a
scythe
to
gather
the
harvested
grains
.

The
cradles
were
sold
not
just
in
Lycoming
County
but
throughout
the
United
States
.

The
first
major
shipment
to
the
west
arrived
in
St.
Louis
,
Missouri
in
0000
.

there

bridge
over
Blockhouse
Creek
,
a
tributary
of
Little
Pine
Creek
.

History
Jackson
Township
was
once
part
of
Lycoming
Township
.

At
the
time
Lycoming
Township
stretched
from
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
to
the
northern
border
of
Lycoming
County
.

The
residents
of
the
northern
part
of
the
township
became
dissatisfied
with
their
representation
in
township
matters
.

Most
of
the
officers
of
the
townships
were
from
the
southern
most
portions
near
the
river
and
they
tended
to
forget
about
their
neighbors
to
the
north
.

The
concerned
citizens
of
the
northern
portions
of
Lycoming
Township
petitioned
that
a
township
for
their
interests
be
formed
from
Lycoming
Township
.

The
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
agreed
and
Jackson
Township
was
formed
in
September
0000
.

The
township
was
named
for
Andrew
Jackson
who
was
then
known
as
the
hero
of
the
Battle
of
New
Orleans
in
the
War
of
0000
.

He
was
not
to
become
President
until
0000
.

Peter
Sechrist
was
one
of
the
first
settlers
to
arrive
in
Jackson
Township
.

He
moved
there
from
Liverpool
,
Pennsylvania
in
0000
.

Sechrist
cleared
the
land
for
a
farm
and
also
constructed
a
saw
and
gristmill
.

His
mills
were
the
first
of
their
kind
in
the
area
and
his
child
,
Daniel
,
was
the
first
white
child
born
in
the
area
.

Other
earlier
settlers
,
seeking
their
fortune
,
arrived
from
York
County
.

Two
sets
of
brothers
,
Jacob
and
Daniel
Beck
and
George
and
Daniel
Miller
first
stopped
in
Williamsport
before
moving
further
to
the
north
.

They
cleared
some
dense
wilderness
and
established
their
homesteads
in
what
is
now
eastern
Jackson
Township
.

The
population
of
Jackson
Township
was
000
according
to
the
0000
census
.

It
has
since
declined
to
000
residents
as
of
the
0000
census
.

The
area
is
largely
mountainous
and
is
covered
with
a
thriving
second
growth
forest

The
Buttonwood
Covered
Bridge
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of

is
a

and
in

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Jersey
Shore
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
March
00
,
0000
.

The
history
of
Jersey
Shore
begins
about
00
years
before
it
was
incorporated
and
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
in
what
is
now
Nippenose
Township
.

Colonel
John
Henry
Antes
arrived
in
0000
and
established
a
homestead
along
the
banks
of
Antes
Creek
.

Antes
also
built
a
gristmill
and
his
fortified
home
,
Fort
Antes
,
provided
a
safe
haven
for
the
early
settlers
against
raids
conducted
by
Loyalist
and
Indian
forces
during
the
American
Revolution
.

Settlers
who
had
sought
refuge
at
Fort
Antes
and
had
returned
to
the
right
bank
of
the
West
Branch
to
milk
their
cows
were
among
the
first
killed
when
Fort
Antes
was
attacked
just
prior
to
the
Big
Runaway
.

These
pioneers
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
were
counted
among
the
Fair
Play
Men
,
a
group
of
squatters
who
lived
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
colonial
and
revolutionary
governments
of
Pennsylvania
.

Many
of
the
settlers
did
not
return
to
the
area
until
after
Sullivan
's
Expedition
had
forced
the
Lenape
and
other
Indians
allied
with
the
British
further
west
.

Jersey
Shore
was
originally
named
Waynesburg
by
the
two
brothers
,
Reuben
and
Jeremiah
Manning
,
who
laid
out
the
town
circa
0000
.

Around
the
time
that
this
was
happening
,
a
settlement
arose
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
(
Nippenose
Township
)
,
opposite
Waynesburg
.

A
rivalry
developed
between
the
two
settlements
,
and
those
on
the
eastern
shore
began
referring
to
the
settlement
on
the
western
shore
as
the
"
Jersey
Shore
,
"
because
the
Manning
family
had
relocated
from
New
Jersey
.

The
nickname
became
so
fixed
that
in
0000
the
original
name
of
Waynesburg
was
officially
abandoned
and
changed
to
Jersey
Shore
.

Jersey
Shore
's
location
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
,
just
downstream
from
the
mouth
of
Pine
Creek
made
it
an
ideal
location
for
traders
and
other
businessmen
who
outfitted
the
pioneers
who
settled
the
western
most
portions
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
and
the
Pine
Creek
valley
.

Thomas
Martin
was
a
farmer
who
sold
his
produce
to
the
people
of
Jersey
Shore
and
to
the
men
and
women
who
were
just
passing
through
.

Mr.
Martin
was
noted
for
his
strong
beliefs
regarding
the
prices
that
he
set
.

For
example
,
if
he
believed
that
his
potato
es
were
worth
00
cents
a
bushel
,
he
would
sell
them
for
00
cents
a
bushel
,
no
more
no
less
.

If
his
competitors
would
sell
potatoes
for
00
cents
a
bushel
,
Martin
would
not
raise
his
price
and
if
others
lowered
the
price
to
00
cents
per
bushel
,
he
would
not
lower
his
price
.

This
firmness
and
fairness
allowed
Thomas
Martin
to
rise
to
a
position
of
prominence
in
Jersey
Shore
and
Lycoming
County
.

His
reputation
for
fairness
and
honesty
was
passed
onto
his
son
Lewis
Martin
who
went
on
to
serve
as
a
Lycoming
County
prothonotary
and
as
a
deputy
U.S.
Marshal
.

The
Reverend
John
Hays
Grier
arrived
in
Jersey
Shore
in
0000
.

He
was
a
Presbyterian
missionary
who
originally
set
out
from
his
home
of
Doylestown
Pennsylvania
with
the
intention
of
serving
the
pioneers
of
the
west
.

He
stopped
one
Sunday
in
Jersey
Shore
and
for
the
most
part
never
left
.

He
built
a
strong
congregation
at
Jersey
Shore
and
another
upstream
on
the
West
Branch
in
Lock
Haven
.

Grier
served
the
churches
in
Lock
Haven
and
Jersey
Shore
for
00
years
before
serving
the
church
in
Jersey
Shore
,
alone
,
for
and
additional
00
years
.

Rev.
Grier
was
also
elected
sheriff
of
Lycoming
County
in
0000
.

Jersey
Shore
was
once
a
major
player
in
the
railroad
industry
.

In
0000
,
the
New
York
Central
and
Hudson
River
Railroad
announced
it
would
build
large
rail
car
shops
near
Avis
,
west
of
Jersey
Shore
,
on
the
far
side
of
Pine
Creek
.

To
induce
workers
and
businesses
to
favor
Jersey
Shore
over
competing
towns
,
entrepreneurs
acquired
land
and
built
the
Jersey
Shore
Electric
Street
Railway
,
a
trolley
line
running
from
the
city
to
the
New
York
Central
shops
.

In
0000
,
a
second
trolley
line
,
the
Jersey
Shore
and
Antes
Fort
Railway
,
was
put
into
service
between
the
city
and
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
station
in
Antes
Fort
,
to
the
southeast
.

These
two
trolley
lines
changed
Jersey
Shore
from
a
city
with
no
railroad
connection
to
a
city
with
two
.

What
had
formerly
been
a
minor
stop
on
the
West
Branch
Canal
and
stagecoach
lines
was
transformed
into
an
industrial
boomtown
.

Over
0,000
skilled
mechanics
were
employed
at
the
car
shops
.

They
were
able
to
earn
wages
that
far
exceeded
the
normal
income
of
the
average
worker
in
Lycoming
County
at
the
time
.

Other
early
industrial
ventures
in
Jersey
Shore
included
the
American
Balance
Valve
and
Machine
Works
(
a
maker
of
railroad
valves
)
,
the
Susquehanna
Silk
Mill
and
the
Jersey
Shore
Creamery
Company
.

Jersey
Shore
Steel
Company
was
founded
in
0000
,
near
the
end
of
the
Great
Depression
by
John
A.
Schultz
.

The
company
began
manufacturing
steel
rails
for
the
railroad
industry
.

In
its
first
year
of
business
Jersey
Shore
Steel
was
able
to
produce
00,000
tons
of
rail
steel
.

When
John
A.
Schultz
died
in
0000
,
the
business
was
passed
onto
his
sons
Charles
and
John
A.
Jr.
.

The
brothers
oversaw
expansion
and
devastation
.

A
massive
fire
nearly
destroyed
the
steel
mill
in
0000
,
and
the
Agnes
Flood
of
0000
caused
tremendous
amounts
of
damage
.

The
company
,
which
is
owned
by
a
third
generation
of
the
Schultz
family
,
operates
two
mills
,
the
original
mill
in
Jersey
Shore
and
a
second
mill
downstream
in
Montoursville
.

It
is
capable
of
producing
000,000
tons
of
rail
steel
annually
.

The
Jersey
Shore
Historic
District
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Lewis
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Lewis
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Hepburn
Township
in
0000
.

It
is
named
for
Ellis
Lewis
who
was
the
president
judge
of
the
local
district
court
at
the
time
.

The
township
was
expanded
in
on
December
00
,
0000
when
part
of
Cascade
Township
was
added
to
Lewis
Township
.

This
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
residents
of
the
area
who
geographically
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Cascade
Township
.

Lycoming
Creek
and
the
Sheshequin
Path
played
an
important
role
in
the
early
history
of
Lewis
Township
.

The
path
was
a
major
Native
American
trail
in
that
ran
between
two
Native
American
villages
:
"
French
Margaret
's
Town
"
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
(
part
of
modern
day
Williamsport
in
Lycoming
County
)
and
"
Sheshequin
"
on
the
North
Branch
of
the
Susquehanna
River
(
modern
day
Ulster
Township
,
in
Bradford
County
)
.

The
path
ran
north
and
east
along
Lycoming
Creek
in
Lycoming
County
and
followed
much
of
Towanda
Creek
in
Bradford
County
.

It
was
a
shortcut
between
the
two
main
branches
of
the
Susquehanna
River
and
was
used
by
early
settlers
as
well
as
Native
Americans
.

Lycoming
Creek
which
begins
to
the
north
of
Lewis
Township
in
McNett
Township
also
served
as
a
highway
of
sorts
during
the
colonial
era
of
Pennsylvania
's
history
.

The
stream
was
used
by
early
explorers
and
the
Native
Americans
in
the
area
as
a
means
of
travel
.

They
were
able
to
float
their
canoes
down
the
creek
and
into
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

This
mode
of
transportation
was
considerably
faster
than
walking
the
path
.

Conrad
Weiser
guided
Moravian
missonaries
along
the
creek
and
path
to
reach
Onondaga
the
capital
of
the
Iroquois
Confederacy
in
0000
.

Raiding
parties
of
Indian
warriors
used
the
creek
and
path
in
0000
when
conducting
attacks
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
Valley
strongholds
of
Fort
Muncy
and
Fort
Freeland
.

Colonel
Thomas
Hartley
led
the
0th
Pennsylvania
Regiment
up
the
Sheshequin
Path
during
the
American
Revolution
.

Hartley
's
expedition
in
0000
preceded
the
Sullivan
Expedition
of
0000
.

Both
Hartley
and
Sullivan
were
instrumental
in
claiming
the
frontier
of
Pennsylvania
and
New
York
for
the
forces
of
the
Continental
Army
.

As
Hartley
and
his
men
passed
through
Lewis
Township
the
Sheshequin
path
was
widened
.

The
widening
of
the
path
helped
to
open
this
area
to
settlement
in
the
years
following
the
Revolution
.

Lewis
Township
was
largely
uninhabited
until
after
the
Revolutionary
War
.

A
squatter
named
A.M.
Slack
is
believed
to
have
been
the
first
permanent
settler
.

He
built
a
cabin
and
cleared
some
land
in
the
area
that
is
now
the
village
of
Bodines
.

The
village
of
Trout
Run
has
its
beginnings
during
the
construction
of
the
Williamson
Road
.

This
road
which
stretched
from
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
to
Painted
Post
,
New
York
helped
to
open
north
central
Pennsylvania
to
settlement
.

Charles
Williamson
,
the
builder
of
the
road
,
established
a
supply
depot
at
Trout
Run
.

Much
of
Lewis
Township
is
covered
with
steep
slopes
that
were
carved
into
the
Allegheny
Plateau
by
the
streams
that
drain
into
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

The
geography
of
the
township
has
limited
the
development
of
the
township
.

A
narrow
valley
along
Lycoming
Creek
is
where
most
of
the
settlement
of
Lewis
Township
has
occurred
.

James
Kyle
arrived
in
the
area
sometime
around
0000
.

He
owned
along
Lycoming
Creek
.

Kyle
took
out
an
advertisement
in
the
Lycoming
Gazette
.

The
ad
placed
on
March
00
,
0000
read
as
follows
.

Kyle
's
farm
was
eventually
sold
to
Robert
Allen
.

Robert
and
his
family
were
among
the
most
successful
and
prominent
early
settlers
.

Allen
was
born
in
Northumberland
on
August
0
,
0000
.

His
father
,
John
Allen
,
was
a
native
of
County
Down
,
Ireland
and
his
mother
was
from
Scotland
.

John
Allen
moved
from
Northumberland
to
a
section
of
land
along
Lycoming
Creek
between
Cogan
Station
and
Hepburnville
in
Hepburn
Township
.

He
died
in
0000
and
his
farm
was
divided
among
his
children
.

Robert
Allen
sold
his
share
of
the
farm
to
his
brothers
and
moved
further
north
along
Lycoming
Creek
and
bought
the
land
that
was

Limestone
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Limestone
Township
was
established
on
December
0
,
0000
by
a
decree
of
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
.

It
was
formed
from
parts
of
Nippenose
and
Wayne
Townships
.

Limestone
Township
was
originally
known
as
Adams
Township
in
honor
of
United
States
President
John
Adams
until
April
00
,
0000
when
the
name
as
changed
to
what
was
deemed
to
be
a
more
appropriate
title
.

The
first
European
settlers
in
the
Limestone
Township
area
arrived
as
early
as
0000
.

The
early
settlers
thought
that
the
land
was
barren
because
the
base
of
valley
was
largely
free
of
trees
.

It
was
covered
by
dense
thickets
of
thorny
bushes
.

At
first
the
land
sold
for
as
little
as
fifty
cents
an
acre
.

After
the
initial
settlers
cleared
the
shrubbery
and
planted
wheat
,
the
land
was
found
to
be
quite
fertile
and
the
price
of
the
land
rose
dramatically
to
$
0.00
per
acre
and
by
the
0000s
the
land
was
selling
for
as
much
as
$
000.00
an
acre
.

Later
settlers
to
Limestone
Township
established
the
communities
of
Collomsville
,
Oriole
and
Oval
.

These
small
towns
were
the
locations
of
small
tavern
s
,
general
store
s
and
sawmill
s.
Much
of
the
farmland
in
the
southeastern
portion
of
Limestone
Township
was
purchased
by
the
Williamsport
Water
Authority
in
the
early
0000s
as
part
of
its
watershed
.

Visitors
to
the
"
water
company
"
lands
can
see
the
stone
remains
of
the
early
settlers
homesteads
spread
throughout
the
watershed
.

The
water
authority
built
a
multi-million
dollar
water
filtration
plant
in
the
0000s
in
Mosquitio
Valley
.

With
the
construction
of
this
plant
the
lands
of
the
water
authority
were
opened
as
a
nature
preserve
to
the
general
public
.

All
visitors
are
required
to
sign
in
at
the
offices
at
the
filtration
plant
on

Loyalsock
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Loyalsock
Township
was
formed
from
Muncy
Township
in
February
0000
by
the
Northumberland
County
court
.

This
was
nine
years
prior
to
the
formation
of
Lycoming
County
.

The
township
was
originally
bounded
by
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
to
the
south
,
Loyalsock
Creek
was
the
eastern
limit
and
Lycoming
Creek
was
the
western
limit
.

As
for
the
northern
limit
,
this
was
undefined
,
it
may
have
extended
as
far
north
as
New
York
state
.

The
city
of
Williamsport
was
formed
in
large
measure
from
a
great
part
of
Loyalsock
Township
.

Seventy-five
percent
of
Williamsport
's
lands
came
from
Loyalsock
.

In
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
and
what
was
to
become
Loyalsock
Township
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

Isaac
and
William
McKinney
,
father
and
son
,
built
the
McKinney
Iron
Works
along
Lycoming
Creek
in
western
Loyalsock
Townshop
between
0000
and
0000
,
when
they
built
a
forge
,
in
an
area
known
as
Heshbon
Park
.

Their
operation
was
expanded
in
0000
with
the
construction
of
an
iron
furnace
and
further
still
in
0000
when
a
rolling
mill
was
added
to
the
complex
.

Iron
ore
was
transported
down
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
and
up
Lycoming
Creek
to
the
iron
works
from
Centre
County
.

The
McKinney
's
effort
was
ultimately
unsuccessful
.

The
efforts
of
two
more
iron
masters
also
failed
.

The
iron
works
was
largely
destroyed
by
a
flood
in
0000
.

Daniel
Hughes
was
a
conductor
in
the
Underground
Railroad
based
in
Loyalsock
Township
.

He
was
the
owner
of
a
barge
on
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
and
transported
lumber
from
Williamsport
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
to
Havre
de
Grace
,
Maryland
.

Hughes
hid
runaway
slaves
in
the
hold
of
his
barge
on
his
return
trip
up
the
Susquehanna
River
to
Lycoming
County
where
he
provided
shelter
on
his
property
near
the
Loyalsock
Township
border
with
Williamsport
before
moving
further
north
and
to
eventual
freedom
in
Canada
.

Hughes
'
home
was
located
in
a
hollow
or
small
valley
in
the
mountains
just
north
of
Williamsport
.

This
hollow
is
now
known
as
Freedom
Road
having
previously
been
called
Nigger
Hollow
.

In
response
to
the
actions
of
concerned
African
American
citizens
of
Williamsport
,
the
pejorative
name
was
formally
changed
by
the
Williamsport
City
Council
in
0000
.

Today
a
great
part
of
Loyalsock
Township
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
Metropolitan
area
.

The
flood
plain
between
Williamsport
and
Montoursville
is
densely
populated
with
family
homes
and
a
shopping
district
known
as
the
"
Golden
Strip
"
along
East
Third
Street
.

The
northern
and
western
parts
of
the
township
are
less
heavily
populated
but
still
there
are
many
family
homes

small
businesses
.

The

McHenry
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
McHenry
Township
was
tentatively
formed
from
parts
of
Cummings
,
Brown
and
Cogan
House
Townships
on
November
00
,
0000
.

It
was
originally
known
as
Kingston
Township
.

Soon
afterwards
the
name
was
changed
to
McHenry
in
honor
of
a
Jersey
Shore
surveyor
,
Alexander
H.
McHenry
.

The
formal
establishment
of
the
township
remained
in
limbo
for
nearly
five
years
.

Some
of
the
residents
in
the
area
were
opposed
to
the
formation
of
a
new
township
.

In
fact
it
took
sixteen
years
for
what
is
now
McHenry
Township
to
finally
be
formed
.

The
initial
proposal
was
placed
before
the
court
in
0000
and
again
in
0000
,
this
was
followed
by
the
0000
case
and
was
finally
settled
on
August
00
,
0000
when
it
was
formed
from
Cummings
and
Brown
Township
.

The
first
warrant
for
land
in
what
is
now
McHenry
Township
was
issued
to
John
Nixon
on
May
00
,
0000
.

John
English
was
a
squatter
on
the
land
as
early
as
0000
.

McHenry
Township
was
settled
by
Claudius
Boatman
and
Comfor
Wanzer
's
families
in
0000
.

Abraham
Harris
was
the
next
settler
in
the
area
arriving
in
0000
.

Boatman
migrated
from
France
.

He
initially
lived
in
the
Mifflinburg
before
moving
further
up
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
and
Pine
Creek
to
western
Lycoming
County
.

Boatman
and
his
wife
Esther
had
a
rather
large
family
.

Most
of
them
married
and
remained
in
McHenry
Township
upon
reaching
adulthood
.

One
daughter
,
Fanny
,
married
John
English
the
original
McHenry
Township
pioneer
.

Another
daughter
,
Rebecca
,
married
and
lived
a
long
life
despite
being
scalped
when
she
was
00
in
0000
.

Esther
Boatman
served
as
a
nurse
and
rural
physician
for
the
pioneers
along
Pine
Creek
.

The
descendants
of
Claudius
Boatman
remain
in
fairly
large
numbers
in
western
Lycoming
County
.

Lumber
ing
was
the
primary
industry
in
McHenry
Township
during
the
mid-to-late
00th
century
.

Thousands
of
acres
of
old-growth
forest
were
cleared
to
meet
the
demands
for
lumber
during
the
lumber
era
that
swept
throughout
Pennsylvania
.

Williamsport
which
is
just
south
and
east
of
McHenry
Township
,
was
known
at
the
"
Lumber
Capital
of
the
World
.
"

Logs
were
floated
down
Pine
Creek
and
into
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
to
various
sawmill
s
along
both
streams
and
in
Williamsport
.

a
very
rural

.

The
ore
was
difficult
to
clean
,
it
could
only
be
separated
from
the
dirt
that
was
mixed
in
when
it
was
frozen
.

And
the
ore
that
they
did
manage
to
extract
produced
iron
that
proved
to
be
very
brittle
.

The
reason
that
several
companies
attempted
to
succeed
in
what
proved
to
be
a
failing
enterprise
was
the
fact
that
the
furnace
was
within
easy
distance
of
the
Williamsport
and
Elmira
Railroad
which
connected
the
industrial
centers
of
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
and
Elmira
,
New

.

The
McIntyre
Coal
company
was
founded
by
Jervis
Langdon
in
0000
.

He
set
up
a
coal
mining
operation
in
the
mountains
in
the
northeastern
section
of
McIntyre
Township
.

Coal
mining
had
taken
place
on
a
small
scale
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
township
,
but
Langdon
was
the
first
to
open
a
large
scale
operation
.

The
coal
company
constructed
a
steep
(
00
degrees
)
and
long
(
0,000
feet
)
incline
plane
to
get
the
coal
from
the
mine
to
the
waiting
railroad
cars
.

The
village
of
McIntyre
sprang
up
around
the
coal
mines
.

At
one
time
it
was
home
to
000
households
,
had
a
church
,
school
,
store
,
sawmill
,
a
boot
and
shoe
shop
,
and
a
public
hall
.

The
McIntyre
Coal
Company
ceased
operation
in
0000
.

The
mine
was
abandoned
,
and
the
town
was
abandoned
shortly
after
the
mine
.

Mifflin
Township
is
a

County
,

,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part

the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical

.

History
Mifflin
Township
was
formed
in
0000
by
dividing
Lycoming
Township
.

It
is
named
in
honor
of
Thomas
Mifflin
the
first
governor
of
Pennsylvania
.

Early
settlers
When
colonial
settlers
first
arrived
in
what
is
now
Mifflin
Township
they
were
outside
the
western
boundary
of
what
was
then
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

These
settlers
were
not
under
the
jurisiction
or
protection
of
any
type
from
any
of
the
Thirteen
Colonies
.

They
became
known
as
the
Fair
Play
Men
.

These
men
established
their
own
form
of
government
,
known
as
the
"
Fair
Play
System
"
,
with
three
elected
commissioners
who
ruled
on
land
claims
and
other
issues
for
the
group
.

In
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
Fair
Play
Men
made
their
own
Declaration
of
Independence
from
Britain
on
July
0
,
0000
beneath
the
"
Tiadaghton
Elm
"
on
the
banks
of
Pine
Creek
.

Mifflin
Township
is
located
within
the
Larrys
Creek
watershed
.

This
area
was
densely
covered
with
trees
and
brush
until
about
0000
when
the
first
settlers
attempted
to
clear
some
of
the
land
that
surrounds
Larrys
Creek
.

John
Murphy
was
the
first
settlers
to
establish
a
permanent
homestead
.

He
cleared
some
land
along
the
creek
and
built
a
home
.

His
daughter
,
Sarah
,
is
thought
to
have
been
the
first
white
child
to
have
been
born
in
Mifflin
Township
.

Murphy
was
soon
followed
by
other
settlers
who
also
built
cabins
,
cleared
some
land
for
farming
and
built
sawmill
s.
Lumber
was
soon
to
become
the
dominant
industry
in
Mifflin
Township
.

The
Lumber
Industry
As
timber
and
lumber
became
a
major
industry
in
the
mid-00th
century
,
Larrys
Creek
,
in
Mifflin
Township
,
was
a
source
of
power
for
sawmills
and
other
mills
.

The
first
sawmill
on
the
creek
was
built
in
0000
.

The
relatively
low
flow
of
water
in
the
creek
did
not
allow
rafts
of
logs
to
be
floated
downstream
to
the
river
and
the
lumber
boom
at
Williamsport
.

This
and
the
lack
of
logging
railroads
along
the
creek
lead
to
the
development
of
many
small
sawmills
.

Twelve
sawmills
were
on
the
Second
Fork
,
six
on
the
First
Fork
,
one
each
on
Canoe
Run
and
the
rest
were
on
Larrys
Creek
itself
.

By
0000
just
two
mills
were
still
standing
and
only
one
of
those
was
operating
.

Lumbering
removed
the
tree
trunks
,
but
left
many
flammable
limbs
,
branches
,
and
stumps
behind
.

On
May
0
,
0000
a
large
forest
fire
destroyed
the
villages
of
Carter
and
Gould
,
0
miles
(
00
km
)
north
of
Salladasburg
on
Larrys
Creek
in
Mifflin
Township

There
are
large
tracts
of
second
growth
forest
and
small
lumber
companies
still
operate
in
the

today

most
well-known
tracks
,
such

Livin

,
and
over
00
million

.

Hear
Before

Die
.

Background
Despite
the
moderate
success
of
0000
°
Fahrenheit
,
Bon
Jovi
were
n't
becoming
the
superstars
they
had
hoped
,
and
they
changed
their
approach
for
their
next
album
.

Hiring
professional
songwriter
Desmond
Child
as
a
collaborator
,
the
group
wrote
00
songs
and
auditioned
them
for
local
New
Jersey
and
New
York
teenagers
,
basing
the
album
's
running
order
on
their
opinions
.

Bruce
Fairbairn
was
chosen
as
the
main
producer
of
the
album
,
with
Bob
Rock
as
the
mixer
.

Writing
and
composition
Much
of
the
album
's
content
was
written
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
,
except
"
You
Give
Love
A
Bad
Name
"
,
"
Livin
'
on
a
Prayer
"
,
"
Without
Love
"
and
"
I
'd
Die
For
You
"
which
were
co-written
by
Desmond
Child
.

Child
was
brought
in
by
the
record
company
to
help
write
some
of
the
songs
along
with
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
.

This
was
the
first
time
Child
worked
with
Jon
and
Richie
.

He
came
to
New
Jersey
,
where
they
worked
on
this
in
the
basement
of
Sambora
's
mother
's
house
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
was
initially
reluctant
to
include
"
Livin
'
on
a
Prayer
"
on
the
album
,
believing
that
it
was
not
a
good
enough
song
.

Richie
Sambora
was
convinced
it
was
a
hit
single
in
the
making
,
and
so
the
band
re-recorded
it
,
releasing
the
second
version
on
the
final
album
.

Ironically
,
it
became
one
of
the
band
's
most
popular
and
well-known
songs
.

One
of
the
songs
written
during
the
making
of
the
album
was
"
Edge
of
a
Broken
Heart
"
,
which
did
not
feature
on
the
final
version
of
the
album
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
has
since
said
that
this
track
should
have
been
on
the
album
.

He
said
"
It
was
absolutely
appropriate
for
the
Slippery
record
-
coulda
,
shoulda
,
woulda
been
on
Slippery
had
cooler
minds
prevailed
.

Here
's
my
formal
apology
.
"

It
was
first
released
on
the
soundtrack
to
the
0000
movie
Disorderlies
and
has
since
been
released
on
the
band
's
box
set
as
well
as
the
special
0-CD
edition
of
Cross
Road
.

It
was
also
on
the
B-side
for
the
Living
on
a
Prayer
single
Album
name
and
art
The
album
went
through
various
name
changes
during
its
inception
including
"
Wanted
Dead
Or
Alive
"
(
an
album
cover
was
produced
with
the
band
dressed
as
cowboys
;
the
artwork
was
later
used
for
the
single
release
of
the
track
of
the
same
name
)
,
with
Slippery
When
Wet
being
the
final
title
conceived
.

According
to
Jon
Bon
Jovi
,
the
album
's
working
titles
were
Wanted
Dead
or
Alive
later
the
band
decided
to
name
the
album
Slippery
When
Wet
after
visiting
The
Number
0
Orange
Stripclub
in
Vancouver
.

The
cover
consists
of
a
wet
black
garbage
bag
with
the
words
"
Slippery
When
Wet
"
traced
in
the
water
.

The
album
originally
was
to
feature
a
busty
,
00DD
woman
in
a
wet
yellow
T-shirt
with
the
album
name
on
the
front
of
the
shirt
.

This
original
version
of
the
cover
was
swapped
for
the
wet
plastic
bag
cover
just
prior
to
release
,
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
Jon
Bon
Jovi
hated
the
pink
border
on
the
cover
.

The
exception
is
in
Japan
,
where
most
releases
of
the
album
do
include
the
original
cover
art
.

Release

album

a

The

P.
M.
Barber

success
.

He
opened
a
distillery
in
0000
and

a
planing

distillery
.

Barber
with
his
partners
,
A.B.
Henderson
,
Jesse
Rank
,

much
success
that
they
laid
out
a
town
around
their
mill
in
0000
.

further
expanded

Borough

Montoursville
is
a
borough
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
borough
population
was
0,000
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

It
was
named
for
Madame
Montour
,
a
Native
American
leader
and
skilled
interpreter
for
the
colonial
governments
.

The
Williamsport
Regional
Airport
is
located
in
Montoursville
.

History
Indian
village
Madame
Montour
's
village
,
became
a
vitally
important
location
during
the
settlement
of
what
is
now
Montoursville
.

Her
village
at
the
mouth
of
Loyalsock
Creek
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
was
an
important
stopping
point
for
the
Moravian
missionaries
who
were
spreading
the
gospel
throughout
the
wilderness
of
Pennsylvania
during
the
0000s
.

Count
Zinzendorf
,
a
missionary
being
guided
by
Conrad
Weiser
with
the
permission
of
Shikellamy
came
to
Otstonwakin
in
0000
.

Madame
Montour
was
known
to
be
a
friend
of
the
British
.

She
welcomed
the
white
men
who
were
beginning
to
migrate
into
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
.

She
also
had
a
great
amount
of
influence
with
the
various
Indian
tribes
they
were
feeling
the
pressure
of
colonial
expansion
.

Madame
Montour
remained
loyal
to
the
British
despite
several
attempts
by
the
French
to
bring
her
over
to
their
side
.

Historians
note
that
this
was
remarkable
due
to
the
fact
the
that
British
colonial
government
sometimes
went
as
long
as
a
year
without
paying
her
for
her
services
.

Madame
Montour
was
the
mother
of
three
children
.

A
son
,
Louis
,
served
as
an
interpreter
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

He
was
killed
during
the
war
.

Her
daughter
,
Margaret
,
later
to
be
known
as
"
French
Margaret
"
went
on
to
become
the
leader
of
"
French
Margaret
's
Town
"
an
Indian
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
Lycoming
Creek
just
a
few
miles
up
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
from
Montoursville
.

Her
son
,
Andrew
took
over
leadership
of
Otstonwakin
upon
her
death
in
the
late
0000s
.

Andrew
inherited
his
mother
’s
gift
for
languages
.

He
spoke
French
,
English
,
Lenape
,
Shawnee
and
the
Iroquoian
languages
.

Comfortable
with
both
Native
Americans
and
Europeans
,
he
made
a
good
living
as
a
translator
for
both
settlers
and
local
tribes
.

In
0000
when
Count
Zinzendorf
met
Montour
he
wrote
that
Montour
looked
"
decidedly
European
,
and
had
his
face
not
been
encircled
with
a
broad
band
of
paint
we
would
have
thought
he
was
one
.
"

He
also
served
as
an
interpreter
with
Conrad
Weiser
and
Chief
Shikellamy
.

He
was
granted
of
land
by
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
in
the
Montoursville
area
.

He
later
was
appointed
as
a
captain
in
George
Washington
's
Army
at
Fort
Necessity
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

Andrew
Montour
left
Montoursville
at
some
point
and
moved
to
Juniata
County
before
finally
settling
on
Mountour
's
Island
in
the
Allegheny
River
near
Pittsburgh
.

Early
settlers
Montoursville
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
February
00
,
0000
.

The
history
of
the
borough
begins
about
00
years
prior
to
its
formal
incorporation
.

John
Else
migrated
to
the
Montoursville
area
from
Bucks
County
,
Pennsylvania
in
0000
.

With
his
family
when
he
was
just
ten
years
old
.

His
father
had
a
farm
along
Mill
Creek
in
what
is
now
Mill
Creek
Township
.

John
Else
worked
to
build
the
first
permanent
bridge
over
Loyalsock
Creek
in
0000
.

This
was
the
first
of
many
improvements
that
he
held
build
to
establish
Montoursville
as
a
viable
community
in
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
.

Else
also
built
many
of
the
structures
in
Montoursville
,
including
its
first
permanent
home
.

John
Burrows
is
recognized
as
being
the
founder
of
Montoursville
.

He
was
born
near
Rahway
,
New
Jersey
.

In
his
youth
Burrows
delivered
mail
on
horseback
,
riding
between
New
York
and
Philadelphia
.

He
also
served
as
a
courier
for
General
George
Washington
during
the
American
Revolution
for
fourteen
months
.

Following
the
war
Burrows
migrated
to
Muncy
and
worked
in
the
distilling
business
for
several
years
.

His
work
at
the
distilleries
enabled
him
to
build
up
the
needed
capital
to
make
an
investment
in
some
land
near
the
mouth
of
Loyalsock
Creek
,
what
is
now
Montoursville
.

Burrows
also
gained
a
measure
of
political
clout
in
Lycoming
County
serving
first
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
before
being
elected
to
the
county
commissioner
's
post
in
0000
and
later
to
the
Pennsylvania
State
Senate
in
0000
.

He
bought
in
0000
.

Burrows
divided
his
land
into
lots
in
0000
and
sold
them
for
$
00.00
each
.

The
first
buyers
of
lots
in
Montoursville
divided
themselves
into
two
distinct
ethnic
groups
.

The
Germans
settled
in
the
eastern
end
in
a
neighborhood
that
became
known
as
Coffee
town
,
while
the
English
settled
in
the
western
neighborhood
that
was
known
as
Tea
town
.

In
addition
to
selling
the
lots
in
Montoursville
Burrows
operated
a
highly
successful
farm
.

His
produce
was
sent
by
raft
down
the
Susquehanna
River
and
onto
Baltimore
where
he
was
able
to
turn
a
profit
.

Burrowns
used
these
profits
to
further
his
enterprise
by
building
the
first
gristmill
in
the
town
.

John
Burrows
continued
to
sell
lots
up
until
the
time
of
his
death
in
0000
.

Nathaniel
Burrows
,
son
of
John
Burrows
,
was
another
successful
businessman
in
Montoursville
's
early
days
.

He
opened
the
first
general
store
in
the
town
.

He
also
received
the
contract
for
construction
of
the
West
Branch
Canal
in
this
section
of
Lycoming
County
.

Nathaniel
Burrows
was
able
to
influence
the
construction
of
the
canal
so
that
it
ran
further
away
from
the
river
than
usual
and
thereby
closer
to
the
town
and
the
businesses
of
Nathaniel
Burrows
.

Indian
Park
Indian
Park
is
located
on
the
north-western
side
of
Montoursville
and
is
parallel
to
Interstate
000
/
U.S.
Route
000
.

It
serves
as
a
large
recreational
park
with
several
miles
of
hiking
and
biking
trails
,
numerous
softball
fields
,
picnic
areas
and
pavilions
and
fishing
ponds
.

Indian
Park
was
a
trolley
park
during
the
late
00th
century
and
early
00th
century
.

Visitors
from
Williamsport
would
board
the
trolley
in
downtown
Williamsport
and
ride
to
Indian
Park
to
spend
a
day
of
recreation
along
the
banks
of
Loyalsock
Creek
.

The
park
was
home
to
one
of
the
largest
and
longest
roller
coasters
on
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
.

The
park
also
featured
over
of
ponds
,
a
theatre
,
and
a
merry-go-round
.

The
amusement
park
was
ultimately
closed
in
0000
due
in
large
part
to
the
rising
and
continued
cost
of
reconstructing
the
park
following
the
nearly
yearly
floods
on
Loyalsock
Creek
.

Moreland
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
,
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
It
was
divided
into
three
townships
in
0000
.

One
part
kept
the
name
Moreland
and
the
other
two
parts
were
called
Penn
and
Franklin
Townships
.

The
Lairdsville
Covered
Bridge
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

The
Houseknecht
Farm
was
added
in
0000
.

The
name
There
are
several
stories
about
how
Moreland
Township
was
named
.

One
story
states
that
an
early
pioneer
to
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
was
climbing
up
and
down
the
hills
and
upon
reaching
the
top
of
a
hill
exclaimed
,
"
more
land
!
"
.

Another
story
relates
to
the
"
sloppiness
"
of
the
earliest
land
surveys
.

An
acre
was
not
necessarily
measured
accurately
.

These
particular
acres
were
larger
than
they
were
supposed
to
be
.

The
early
settlers
liked
to
say
that
they
got
"
more
land
"
to
the
acre
here
than
they
could
have
elsewhere
.

The
most
likely
reason
relates
to
an
arcane
definition
of
moreland
,
meaning
"
a
hilly
country
"
.

Early
settlers
A
veteran
of
the
American
Revolution
ary
War
was
the
first
settler
in
Moreland
Township
.

Colonel
George
Smith

to
Moreland
Township
from
Montgomery
County
in
0000
.

He
built
a
gristmill
there
in
0000
.

Smith
and
his
wife
were
the
parents
of
0
children
,
0
boys
and
0
girls
.

The
marriage
of
his
daughter
,
Annie
to
a
Quaker
named
William
Farr
causes
some
controversy
in
the
early
history
of
Moreland
Township
.

William
Farr
came
from
a
strict
Quaker
family
and
they
did
not
look
kindly
upon
his
choice
of
bride
.

The
local
Quaker
congregation
insisted
that
Farr
confess
that
he
had
done
wrong
in
marrying
outside
his
faith
.

Farr
refused
to
do
so
and
insisted
that
his
Baptist
wife
,
Annie
,
was
a
good
Christian
woman
.

Farr
was
forced
to
choose
between
his
Quaker
faith
and
his
Baptist
wife
.

He
chose
his
wife
and
converted
to
the
Baptist
faith
.

Colonel
Smith
's
son
,
Jonathan
,
also
had
a
marriage
that
proved
to
be
interesting
.

He
married
Annie
Simpson
,
the
sister
of
John
Simpson
of
Ohio
.

John
Simpson
was
the
grandfather
of
Ulysses
S.
Grant
who
became
President
of
the
United
States
.

This
family
bond
meant
that
many
of
the
residents
of
Moreland
Township
in
the
mid-00th
century
were
second
cousin
s
to
the
man
who
served
as
their
President
.

Muncy
is
a
borough
in
Lycoming
County
and
Northumberland
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United

.

The
name

comes
from
the
Munsee
Indians
who
once
lived
in
the
area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at

It
is
part
of
the

,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan

Area
.

Muncy
is
located

Branch
Susquehanna
River
,
just
south
of
the
confluence
of
Muncy
Creek
with
the
river

History
Early
Settlement
About
0000
,
four
brothers
Silas
,
William
,
Benjamin
,
and
Isaac
McCarty
,
came
here
from
Bucks
County
.

They
were
of
Quaker
extraction
.

William
and
Benjamin
bought
known
as
the
"
John
Brady
farm
.
"

John
Brady
was
one
of
the
earliest
settlers
in
the
area
.

He
received
a
land
grant
which
was
awarded
to
the
officers
who
served
in
the
Bouquet
Expedition
.

He
chose
land
west
of
present
day
Lewisburg
,
Pennsylvania
.

He
built
a
private
stockade
on
this
land
in
the
Spring
of
0000
,
close
to
present
day
Muncy
,
Pennsylvania
,
which
he
called
"
Fort
Brady
.
"

John
Brady
's
Muncy
house
was
large
for
its
day
.

He
dug
a
trench
around
it
and
emplaced
upright
logs
in
that
trench
side
by
side
all
the
way
around
.

He
filled
the
trench
with
dirt
and
packed
the
dirt
against
the
logs
to
hold
the
log
wall
solidly
in
place
.

This
log
wall
ran
about
twelve
feet
high
from
the
ground
.

He
then
held
this
wall
in
place
upright
by
pinning
smaller
logs
across
its
top
,
to
keep
the
wall
face
steady
and
solid
.

The
John
Brady
homestead
was
perilously
close
to
the
leading
edge
of
the
frontier
of
that
time
,
the
Susquehanna
River
.

The
other
side
of
the
Susquehanna
was
fiercely
dominated
by
the
Indians
.

The
Indians
resisted
settler
encroachment
on
their
territory
by
routinely
crossing
the
Susquehanna
to
raid
the
settlers
.

The
settlers
just
as
routinely
crossed
the
Susquehanna
to
pursue
the
raiding
war
parties
to
retaliate
and
sometimes
to
rescue
captives
taken
by
the
Indians
during
these
raids
.

In
this
ongoing
skirmishing
,
both
sides
committed
unspeakable
atrocities
on
the
other
,
which
drove
a
long-lasting
cycle
of
revenge
for
revenge
brutalities
between
the
settlers
and
Indians
.

It
was
in
the
midst
of
this
extreme
danger
and
violence
that
Major
John
Brady
chose
to
settle
his
family
,
which
set
the
stage
for
what
happened
to
him
and
for
what
so
greatly
impacted
and
influenced
his
family
—
especially
,
his
sons
,
Continental
Army
Captain
Samuel
Brady
of
Brady
's
Leap
fame
and
Hugh
Brady
,
who
became
a
Major
General
in
the
United
States
Army
.

The
McCarty
brothers
divided
up
the
former
Brady
land
,
with
William
taking
the
portion
between
what
is
now
West
Water
Street
and
Muncy
Creek
,
and
Benjamin
that
portion
between
West
Water
Street
and
the
southern
boundary
.

Main
Street
now
represents
what
was
then
the
boundary
between
the
Brady
farm
and
Isaac
Walton
's
.

In
0000
,
ten
years
after
coming
to
Muncy
,
Benjamin
McCarty
conceived
the
idea
of
starting
a
town
,
and
began
laying
out
lots
on
what
is
now
Main
Street
,
and
sold
them
to
different
parties
.

His
example
was
followed
by
his
brother
William
,
north
of
Water
street
,
and
by
Isaac
Walton
.

The
town
was
named
Pennsborough
in
honor
of
the
William
Penn
.

The
town
grew
slowly
and
was
nothing
but
a
village
for
many
years
.

More
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
passed
before
an
act
of
incorporation
was
applied
for
.

Finally
,
by
act
approved
March
00
,
0000
,
it
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

On
January
00
,
0000
,
with
a
population
of
less
than
000
,
the
name
was
changed
from
Pennsborough
to
Muncy
.

This
was
done
because
many
persons
thought
it
was
"
too
flat
and
long
,
"
and
the
new
name
would
be
more
in
accordance
with
the
historical
associations
of
the
place
,
and
serve
to
perpetuate
the
name
of
the
tribe
that
first
dwelt
there
,
a
tribe
of
Lenape
,
named
Monseys
.

Abolition
Riot
of
0000
One
of
the
common
misconceptions
about
United
States
history
prior
to
the
Civil
War
is
that
all
the
citizens
of
the
northern
states
were
against
slavery
.

In
fact
many
of
the
"
Yankees
"
,
were
all
for
slavery
,
especially
in
states
closer
to
the
Confederacy
like
Pennsylvania
,
Ohio
and
Delaware
.

There
were
more
than
a
few
abolitionists
in
Pennsylvania
,
and
Enos
Hawley
,
a
Quaker
citizen
of
Muncy
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
abolitionists
in
Lycoming
County
.

Hawley
,
a
tanner
by
trade
,
was
like
most
Quakers
a
strong
supporter
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
.

Hawley
invited
,
a
now
unknown
,
speaker
to
come
to
Muncy
to
speak
against
slavery
.

This
speaker
arrived
in
April
0000
.

His
arrival
and
coinciding
speech
set
off
a
tremendous
riot
that
lead
to
the
near
destruction
of
a
local
schoolhouse
and
the
controversial
pardon
ing
of
the
rioters
by
Pennsylvania
Governor
David
R.
Porter
.

The
anti-slavery
speaker
gave
his
speech
at
a
one-room
school
in
Muncy
in
April
0000
.

During
the
course
of
the
speech
,
eighteen
men
gathered
outside
the
schoolhouse
.

They
began
throwing
rocks
and
other
debris
at
the
school
,
breaking
all
of
the
windows
.

Enos
Hawley
and
the
guest
speaker
were
both
injured
in
the
assault
.

Upon
fleeing
the
school
,
the
abolitionists
were
pelted
with
eggs
.

The
rioters
followed
Hawley
and
his
guest
to
Hawley
's
home
at
the
corner
of
High
and
Main
Streets
.

They
continued
the
assault
on
Hawley
's
home
until
after
midnight
when
the
local
law
enforcement
officers
were
able
to
quell
the
riot
and
arrest
the
rioters
.

The
rioters
were
indicted
in
September
and
went
to
trial
in
October
when
thirteen
of
the
eighteen
rioters
were
found
guilty
as
charged
.

The
jury
's
deliberation
was
quite
a
long
process
.

Abraham
Updegraff
was
a
member
of
the
jury
who
was
the
driving
force
that
led
to
the
conviction
of
the
rioters
.

Updegraff
,
an
ardent
abolitionist
who
was
a
vital
member
of
the
Underground
Railroad
in
Lycoming
County
,
was
able
to
convince
his
peers
that
the
rioters
deserved
to
be
punished
.

The
first
jury
vote
was
00
to
0
in
favor
of
acquittal
,
with
Upedgraff
being
the
lone
dissent
er
.

Updegraff
argued
that
"
we
have
been
sworn
to
try
this
case
according
to
the
law
and
the
evidence
presented
and
that
if
no
contradictory
evidence
offered
by
the
defendants
than
we
could
do
nothing
more
than
to
convict
them
.
"

He
was
able
to
make
his
argument
in
German
which
was
the
native
tongue
of
three
other
jurors
.

The
second
voted
was
0
to
0
in
favor
of
acquittal
.

A
third
vote
brought
about
the
conviction
of
00
of
the
00
men
charged
in
the
Muncy
Abolition
Riot
of
0000
.

This
conviction
was
essentially
overturned
by
Governor
David
R.
Porter
when
he
pardoned
the
rioters
several
days
later
.

Governor
Porter
's
statement
of
pardon
said
,
"
It
is
represented
to
me
by
highly
respected
citizens
of
Lycoming
County
,
that
this
prosecution
was
instituted
more
with
a
view
to
the
accomplishment
of
political
ends
than
to
serve
the
cause
of
law
and
order
.
"

Porter
's
pardon
message
placed
the
blame
for
the
riot
on
the
abolitionist
speaker
.

Porter
stated
that
the
speech
was
"
notoriously
offensive
to
the
minds
of
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
and
were
calculated
to
bring
about
a
breach
of
the
peace
.
"

This
pardon
led
to
Governor
Porter
being
given
the
less
than
flattering
nickname
of
the
"
Previous
Pardonin
Porter
.
"

Historians
believe
that
Porter
pardoned
the
rioters
under
political
pressure
that
was
rampant
,
in
the
years
prior
to
the
Civil
War
,
regarding
the
issue
of
slavery
.

Jersey
is
the
fourth

album
by
the
American
rock
band
Bon
Jovi
,
It
was
released
on
00
September
0000
through
Mercury
Records
.

The
album
produced
by
Bruce
Fairbairn
and
recorded
at
the
Little
Mountain
Sound
Studios
in
Vancouver
,
Canada
.

The
album
was
the
follow-up
to
the
band
's
0000
breakthrough
Slippery
When
Wet
,
reaching
at
#
0
on
the
Billboard
000
and
producing
five
Billboard
Hot

top
ten
singles
,
the
most

hits
to
date
for
a
hard
rock
album
.
"

Medicine
"
and
"
I
'll
Be
There
for
You
"
both
hit
#
0
on
Billboard
Hot

.

The
album
was
certified
seven
times
platinum
by
the
Recording
Industry
Association
of
America
.

The
album
also
debuted
at
#
0
in
UK
and
became
the
band
's
first
UK
#
0
album
.

New
Jersey
was
released
by
the
Soviet
state-owned
record
company
"
Melodiya
"
,
being
the
first
American
album
ever
released
in
USSR
.

Background
The
album
was
recorded
very
shortly
after
the
Slippery
When
Wet
Tour
,
because
the
band
wanted
to
prove
that
they
were
not
just
a
one
hit
wonder
.

The
album
was
initially
meant
to
be
a
double
album
;
however
,
this
idea
was
rejected
by
the
record
company
because
they
got
nervous
about
the
higher
price
point
and
decided
they
would
only
release
a
single
album
.

One
working
title
for
the
album
was
Sons
of
Beaches
,
which
parodied
the
title
of
their
previous
album
Slippery
When
Wet
.

Recording
and
production
The
album
produced
by
Bruce
Fairbairn
like
its
predecessor
and
recorded
at
the
Little
Mountain
Sound
Studios
in
Vancouver
,
Canada
.

The
album
marked
the
final
collaboration
between
Bon
Jovi
and
producer
Bruce
Fairbairn
.

When
the
Slippery
When
Wet
Tour
ended
in
October
0000
the
band
did
n’t
do
anything
for
about
three
or
four
weeks
.

Then
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
demoed
the
first
batch
of
songs
.

But
they
really
started
to
feel
the
pressure
then
because
they
did
n’t
have
the
amazing
song
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
said
that
"
I
really
wanted
to
do
it
again
,
not
for
monetary
reasons
-
I
have
plenty
of
money
-
but
it
was
such
an
amazing
feeling
to
have
done
what
we
’ve
done
.

There
was
a
real
fear
of
not
being
able
to
write
You
Give
Love
A
Bad
Name
again
"
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
sat
in
the
house
and
wrote
the
song
called
"
Love
Is
War
"
but
Jon
Bon
Jovi
wanted
to
write
You
Give
Love
A
Bad
Name
so
much
,
it
came
out
with
exactly
the
same
chord
progression
.

Then
they
started
on
the
second
batch
and
they
wrote
"
Born
To
Be
My
Baby
"
and
"
Bad
Medicine
"
with
Desmond
Child
.

Born
To
Be
My
Baby
was
originally
recorded
acoustically
,
however
the
producer
Bruce
Fairbairn
persuaded
them
to
re-recorded
it
with
electronic
instruments
in
a
harder
rock
style
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
has
since
said
that
he
believed
the
song
would
have
made
#
0
on
the
charts
if
it
had
been
released
in
its
original
form
.

This
song
has
similar
theme
to
"
Livin
'
On
A
Prayer
,
"
as
its
about
a
young
working
class
couple
struggling
to
make
ends
meet
.

Although
the
glossy
production
and
anthems
from
Slippery
When
Wet
remained
,
band
wanted
to
show
that
there
was
more
on
the
new
album
.

The
album
comes
across
as
a
lot
more
experimental
with
long
atmosphere
building
intro
of
Lay
Your
Hands
On
Me
,
harmonica
and
organ
duels
of
"
Homebound
Train
"
and
flamenco
guitar
intro
of
"
Wild
Is
The
Wind
"
.
"

Ride
Cowboy
Ride
"
sounds
as
if
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
are
singing
with
their
acoustic
guitars
in
to
an
old
tape
recorder
.

It
's
a
quick
little
song
functioning
as
an
introduction
to
"
Stick
To
Your
Guns
"
.

Part
of
the
song
's
allure
is
the
mono
recording
.

The
song
is
credited
to
Captain
Kidd
and
King
of
Swing
,
the
nicknames
of
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
.
"

Love
For
Sale
"
was
also
recorded
drunk
during
"
one
hell
of
a
party
"
in
a
place
called
Chalet
Sound
in
New
Jersey
.

Release
and
reception
New
Jersey
debuted
at
#
0
on
Billboard
000
,
the
following
week
reached

and
spent
four
weeks

It
eventually

The

census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan

Society
of
Friends
(

)
Meeting
House
in
Pennsdale
that

,
and
is
one
of

buildings
and
perhaps
the
oldest
house
of
worship
in
the
county
.

History
Muncy
Township
,
named
for
the
Munsee
tribe
,
was
the
first
township
in
the
county
north
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
to
be
formed
(
predating
even
Lycoming
County
itself
)
.

It
was
originally
formed
as
a
part
of
Northumberland
County
on
April
0
,
0000
.

Muncy
Township
,
as
one
of
the
seven
original
townships
of
Northumberland
County
was
once
an
immense
township
.

It
had
an
indefinite
norther
border
.

The
southern
border
of
the
township
was
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

The
eastern
boundary
may
have
been
Muncy
Creek
and
the
western
boundary
was
,
like
the
northern
boundary
,
indefinite
.

Loyalsock
Township
was
the
first
township
to
be
formed
from
Muncy
Township
in
0000
.

This
division
encompassed
the
land
between
Loyalsock
and
Lycoming
Creek
s.
The
township
was
divided
several
more
times
.

Muncy
Creek
Township
was
formed
in
0000
,
Shrewsbury
Township
in
0000
,
Penn
Township
in
0000
,
Wolf
Township
in
0000
and
lastly
in
0000
when
Mill
Creek
Township
was
formed
.

Samuel
Wallis
was
one
of
the
first
permanent
settlers
in
Muncy
Township
.

Known
as
the
"
Land
King
"
Wallis
operated
Muncy
Farms
which
was
for
its
time
a
large
and
very
successful
farm
.

Wallis
first
came
to
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
Valley
in
0000
as
a
surveyor
.

He
was
born
in
Harford
County
,
Maryland
in
0000
to
a
wealthy
Quaker
family
.

Wallis
received
a
good
education
and
inherited
a
large
fortune
.

He
sought
to
expand
his
fortune
in
various
ways
.

He
worked
for
a
while
as
a
shipping
merchant
in
Philadelphia
and
became
a
surveyor
.

While
working
as
a
surveyor
Wallis
was
introduced
to
what
would
become
his
home
in
0000
.

He
gave
up
his
job
as
a
surveyor
and
began
acquiring
land
up
and
down
the
West
Branch
Valley
.

His
holdings
are
said
to
have
extended
as
far
west
as
Pine
Creek
from
his
base
of
operations
in
Muncy
Township
.

Wallis
held
title
to
the
land
that
has
since
become
,
Muncy
,
Muncy
Creek
Township
,
Muncy
Township
,
Montoursville
,
Loyalsock
Township
,
Williamsport
,
Woodward
Township
,
Piatt
Township
,
Porter
Township
and
Jersey
Shore
.

Wallis
'
home
was
one
of
,
if
not
the
,
first
houses
to
be
built
in
what
is
now
Lycoming
County
.

Samuel
Wallis
was
such
an
important
figure
in
the
early
history
of
Muncy
Township
that
Fort
Muncy
was
built
on
his
land
.

This
fort
served
as
an
outpost
for
the
colonial
army
of
Pennsylvania
providing
a
safe
haven
for
settlers
from
various
Indian
attacks
.

Samuel
Wallis
married
Lydia
Hollingsworth
in
Philadelphia
on
March
0
,
0000
.

They
settled
at
Muncy
Farms
soon
after
the
marriage
and
continued
to
farm
while
Wallis
continued
to
expand
his
land
holdings
.

Wallis
was
forced
to
flee
Muncy
Farms
during
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
.

During
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
Big
Runaway
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

Wallis
returned
as
soon
as
it
was
safe
and
continued
to
farm
.

He
also
built
a
gristmill
along
Carpenter
's
Run
.

The
construction
of
this
mill
was
entrusted
to
Colonel
Henry
Antes
of
Nippenose
Township
.

Antes
was
the
operator
of
the
most
successful
mill
in
the
area
along
Antes
Creek
.

Samuel
Wallis
and
James
Wilson
a
signer
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
the
Supreme
Court
appointee
of
George
Washington
became
involved
with
Theophilus
Cazenove
and
the
Holland
Land
Company
.

This
company
bought
up
much
of
the
land
that
his
now
northwestern
Pennsylvania
and
western
New
York
near
the
Great
Lakes
.

Wallis
worked
as
a
surveyor
and
assessor
for
the
land
company
and
Wilson
was
heavily
invested
in
the
operation
.

Wilson
owed
a
tremendous
debt
to
Wallis
and
others
.

He
fled
to
Edenton
,
North
Carolina
to
escape
his
debts
.

Wallis
followed
him
there
in
an
effort
to
reach
a
settlement
.

They
reached
a
prelimary
agreement
and
agreed
to
meet
again
.

Both
men
died
before
the
debts
could
be
settled
.

Wallis
contracted
yellow
fever
on
his
return
from
North
Carolina
and
died
in
Philadelphia
on
October
00
,
0000
.

Wilson
died
in

North
Carolina
on
August
00
,
0000
.

Wallis
'
heir
were
unable
to
collect
Wilson
's
debt
.

Wallis
himself
left
a
large
debt
behind
.

The
heirs
were
forced
to
sell
Samuel
Wallis
'
land
for
a
fraction
of
his
value
to
Henry
Drinker
.

Drinker
gave
the
land
to
his
daughter
and
son-in-law
,
Elizabeth
and
Charles
Hall
.

Muncy
Creek
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
unincorporated
village
of
Clarkstown
is
located
in
Muncy
Creek
Township
.

History
Muncy
Creek
Township
was
formed
when
Muncy
Township
was
divided
for
the
second
time
in
0000
.

The
township
is
named
for
Muncy
Creek
a
tributary
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
that
flows
threw
it
.

Some
of
the
oldest
settlements
of
Lycoming
County
are
in
Muncy
Creek
Township
.

The
township
also
played
an
important
role
in
the
development
and
regular
use
of
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
along
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

The
hamlet
of
Port
Penn
rose
up
along
the
section
of
the
canal
that
passed
through
Muncy
Creek
Township
.

This
hamlet
,
greatly
reduced
in
population
,
was
a
very
busy
and
sometimes
dangerous
place
.

Muncy
Dam
was
built
across
the
river
at
Muncy
Creek
Township
.

This
dam
provided
the
water
that
was
needed
to
fill
the
canal
along
a
stretch
canal
that
began
at
Port
Penn
and
ended
at
Sunbury
.

The
dam
,
canal
and
towing
path
were
all
constructed
for
a
considerable
amount
of
money
.

Around
these
construction
projects
,
the
hamlet
of
Port
Penn
was
built
.

Upon
completion
of
the
canal
in
0000
it
was
already
a
thriving
community
featuring
a
manufacturer
of
canal
boats
.

Other
businesses
in
Port
Penn
included
hotels
and
taverns
that
provided
housing
and
food
for
the
men
working
on
the
canal
,
and
a
blacksmith
and
a
saddle
maker
.

There
was
a
butcher
who
also
operated
a
grocery
business
,
a
weaver
,
a
wagon
builder
,
a
shoemaker
,
an
ice
business
,
as
well
as
several
teachers
,
masons
and
general
merchants
.

Port
Penn
quickly
gained
a
reputation
as
being
a
dangerous
place
that
attracted
"
unsavory
"
characters
.

Gambling
and
prize
fighting
were
two
popular
past
times
.

Large
amounts
of
alcohol
were
consumed
by
the
participants
furthering
the
danger
.

An
organized
group
of
counterfeiters
had
an
operation
in
a
cabin
in
Muncy
Creek
Township
that
passed
fake
coins
onto
the
boatmen
and
others
that
passed
by
Port
Penn
on
the
canal
.

A
riot
took
place
during
the
construction
of
the
canal
that
resulted
in
several
deaths
.

A
man
named
Barney
McCue
is
responsible
for
at
least
two
murder
s
at
Port
Penn
,
one
in
0000
and
another
four
years
later
in
0000
.

Many
children
drowned
in
the
canal
and
river
.

The
railroad
that
largely
replaced
the
canal
was
not
less
dangerous
as
several
lives
were
claimed
on
the
rails
.

Even
the
so
called
"
Last
Raft
"
to
be
floated
down
the
West
Branch
took
several
lives
at
Port
Penn.
.

The
raft
hit
the
railroad
bridge
and
sent
00
passengers
into
the
river
,
seven
of
whom
died
.

The
canal
in
Muncy
Creek
Township
brought
vast
amounts
of
goods
that
were
stored
in
warehouses
in
Port
Penn
and
Muncy
.

The
farmers
and
industrialists
of
Lycoming
County
used
these
warehouses
to
store
their
goods
before
they
were
sent
south
on
the
canal
.

The
chief
exports
of
the
county
were
hogs
,
wheat
,
flour
,
lumber
,
dried
and
salted
meats
,
leather
and
whiskey
.

Whiskey
was
a
very
big
business
.

At
least
00
distilleries
in
the
area
produced
and
out
put
of
0,000
to
0,000
gallons
of
whiskey
a
day
.

Muncy
Creek
Township
also
was
home
to
a
thriving
commercial
fishing
industry
.

The
dam
was
an
ideal
point
to
catch
fish
.

The
bottleneck
in
the
river
caused
by
the
dam
and
canal
locks
caused
the
fish
to
be
forced
into
one
easy
to
reach
location
.

Baskets
were
placed
along
the
dam
and
locks
and
tremendous
amounts
of
fish
and
eels
were
easily
caught
.

The
dams
and
locks
at
Port
Penn
were
destroyed
by
numerous
floods
in
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
during
the
late
0000s
.

This
caused
the
canal
to
be
abandoned
as
it
was
replaced
by
the
railroads
.

Port
Penn
was
since
faded
away
.

There
are
several
homes
in
the
area
,
but
as
a
hamlet
it
no
longer
exists
.

Parts
of
Port
Penn
have
been
annexed
by
the
borough
of
Muncy
and
others
are
in
Muncy
Creek
Township
.

Lycoming
College
and
the
Muncy
Historical
Society
have
spearheaded
an
effort
to
uncover
the
history
of
Port
Penn.

Nippenose
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Nippenose
Township
was
formed
as
part
of
Northumberland
County
in
0000
by
a
session
of
the
Northumberland
County
court
that
was
held
in
Sunbury
.

It
did
not
become
part
of
Lycoming
County
until
Lycoming
County
was
also
formed
from
Northumberland
County
in
0000
.

Nippenose
Township
was
originally
much
larger
than
it
is
today
.

It
spread
over
parts
of
what
are
now
,
Clinton
,
Centre
and
Lycoming
Counties
.

The
population
of
Nippenose
Township
was
000
,
in
0000
,
compared
to
the
slightly
higher
population
of
000
as
of
the
0000
census
.

Etymology
The
story
behind
the
name
of
Nippenose
Township
is
unclear
.

There
are
two
competing
stories
.

One
states
that
it
is
named
for
the
Indian
phrase
,
"
Nippeno-wi
"
,
meaning
a
warm
and
genial
summer
like
place
.

The
other
story
behind
the
name
is
traces
back
an
old
Indian
named
Nippenose
.

The
early
settlers
told
the
story
of
the
old
man
who
lingered
in
the
valley
after
it
was
settled
by
whites
.

Apparently
this
man
's
nose
had
been
"
nipped
"
by
exposure
to
the
frost
,
hence
the
name
"
Nippenose
.
"

An
additional
source
of
the
name
is
that
there
is
only
one
way
into
and
out
of
the
valley
without
going
over
a
mountain
.

This
gap
is
bordered
on
the
west
by
a
mountain
with
nip
in
the
end
of
it
,
like
a
nipped
nose
.

Colonel
John
Henry
Antes
The
first
colonial
settlers
arrived
in
the
Nippenose
area
in
0000
.

Henry
Clark
was
the
first
to
arrive
with
a
"
warrant
"
to
the
land
from
the
colonial
Pennsylvania
government
.

One
of
the
most
prominent
eary
settlers
was
Colonel
John
Henry
Antes
.

He
is
thought
to
have
arrived
as
early
as
0000
.

His
last
name
is
featured
prominently
in
place
names
in
Nippenose
Township
.

Antes
Creek
the
main
creek
in
the
valley
and
Antes
Fort
a
small
village
both
bear
his
name
.

Antes
built
stockade
around
his
home
,
his
neighbors
came
to
call
it
"
Antes
Fort
"
and
the
name
has
lived
on
to
today
.

Colonel
Antes
also
built
a
grist
mill
at
the
mouth
of
Antes
Creek
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
in
0000
.

This
mill
was
burned
during
the
Revolutionary
war
.

During
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

When
things
finally
calmed
down
in
0000
,
Colonel
Antes
returned
to
Nippenose
Township
and
rebuilt
his
mill
this
second
mill
was
a
vital
link
the
economy
of
Nippenose
Township
until
0000
when
a
new
mill
was
built
in
its
place
.

Antes
furthered
his
enterprises
by
building
a
carding
and
fulling
mill
on
the
banks
of
Antes
Creek
in
0000
.

Antes
died
in
0000
.

Ownership
of
the
mills
was
passed
onto
his
son-in-law
Elias
P.
Youngman
.

Youngman
and
his
sons
expanded
the
business
yet
again
in
0000
by
adding
machinery
that
was
able
to
clean
clover
seed
.

Clover
seed
was
very
expensive
at
the
time
,
a
bushel
of
the
seed
sold
for
as
much
as
$
00.00
.

Clover
was
very
important
to
farmers
for
providing
ground
cover
and
as
a
food
supply
for
their
grazing
dairy
cows
.

Antes
Fort
The
village
of
Antes
Fort
rose
up
around
the
train
station
that
was
built
in
Nippenose
Township
to
service
the
borough
of
Jersey
Shore
which
is
the
north
and
across
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
from
Nippenose
Township
.

Antes
Fort
went
through
several
name
changes
.

The
surveyor
who
drew
up
the
towns
plans
called
it
"
Granville
"
.

This
name
was
seldom
uses
as
the
locals
preferred
to
call
it
"
Jersey
Shore
Station
"
.

The
name
Antes
Fort
was
not
bestowed
on
the
village
until
0000
when
the
United
States
Post
Office
established
a
branch
there
and
named
it
in
honor
of
Colonel
Antes
'
stockade
.

Nippenose
Valley
The
region
includes
anticlinal
karst
Nippenose
Valley
part
of
the
northernmost
fold
sequence
of
the
Ridge
and
Valley
Physiographic
Province
.

Nippenose
Valley
is
uniquely
bowl-shaped
and
consists
of
a
doubly
plunging
anticline
.

According
to
a
research
paper
from
the
University
of
Akron
,
The
center
has
been
eroded
,
exposing
carbonate
rocks
in
the
valley
.

There
is
an
average
total
of
about
000
meters
of
Lower
to
Middle
Ordovician
limestone
and
dolomite
underlying
the
valley
.

The
Reedsville
Shale
is
stratigraphically
above
them
,
and
overlain
by
the
ridge
forming
Bald
Eagle
Sandstone
.

The
valley
has
been
intensely
karstified
,
as
evidenced
by
the
numerous
sinkholes
,
springs
,
caves
,
and
disappearing
streams
.

Within
a
number
of
caves
in
this
valley
a
new
species
of
fish

Old
Lycoming
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Old
Lycoming
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
that
is
actually
older
than
the
county
.

It
was
formed
as
part
of
Northumberland
County
on
August
00
,
0000
,
ten
years
before
the
formation
of
Lycoming
County
.

The
original
boundaries
of
the
township
ecompassed
much
of
the
territory
that
was
previously
governed
by
the
Fair
Play
Men
.

The
land
between
Lycoming
and
Pine
Creeks
was
outside
of
the
legal
boundaries
of
Pennsylvania
until
0000
and
the
second
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
.

The
Fair
Play
Men
operated
a
system
of
self
government
from
0000
to
0000
.

Their
claims
to
the
land
had
no
legal
bearing
in
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
when
it
was
finally
legally
part
of
the
state
.

These
men
had
some
troubles
gaining
the
title
to
the
land
that
they
had
cleared
and
defended
for
so
long
.

Some
of
them
were
able
to
keep
their
lands
and
others
chose
to
move
further
west
.

In
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
Valley
,
including
what
is
now
Old
Lycoming
Township
,
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

In
the
early
summer
of
0000
news
came
of
a
group
of
Native
American
warriors
,
perhaps
accompanied
by
Loyalist
and
British
soldiers
,
heading
for
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
to
destroy
settlements
.

There
were
many
smaller
incidents
of
violence
against
settlers
,
but
on
June
00
,
0000
a
party
of
sixteen
settlers
were
attacked
in
what
is
now
Williamsport
.

In
what
became
known
as
the
"
Plum
Tree
Massacre
"
,
twelve
of
the
sixteen
were
killed
and
scalped
,
including
two
women
and
six
children
.

The
Wyoming
Valley
Massacre
occurred
on
July
0
,
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
.

This
news
caused
the
local
authorities
to
order
the
evacuation
of
the
whole
West
Branch
valley
.

Most
of
the
settlers
did
not
return
to
their
farms
until
after
Sullivan
's
Expedition
had
driven
off
the
Indian
and
Loyalist
threat
.

John
McMeens
a
native
of
South
Carolina
was
one
of
the
first
to
return
to
the
area
.

He
had
settled
along
the
river
in
0000
.

He
fled
during
the
Big
Runaway
and
returned
in
0000
.

McMeens
rose
to
a
position
of
prominence
in
Lycoming
County
.

He
was
a
county
commissioner
,
state
commissioner
and
served
on
the
initial
committee
that
explored
to
possibility
of
building
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
that
improved
navigation
on
the
Susquehanna
River
.

McMeens
also
represented
the
area
in
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
from
0000
to
0000
.

Derick
Updegraff
arrived
in
Old
Lycoming
Township
from
York
County
in
0000
.

He
settled
on
land
that
had
previously
been
improved
during
the
Fair
Play
Men
era
.

He
was
not
able
to
claim
legal
control
of
his
until
0000
as
the
resulty
of
a
law
suit
over
the
land
filed
by
the
man
who
had
previously
claimed
it
.

Updegraff
and
his
sons
improved
the
land
by
clearing
many
more
acres
and
building
what
was
one
of
the
largest
barn
s
in
Lycoming
County
.

Today
Old
Lycoming
Township
includes
the
census
designated
area
of
Garden
View
.

Garden

serves
as
a
suburb

census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Piatt
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Mifflin
Township
by
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
on
April
00
,
0000
.

The
new
township
encompassed
what
was
the
southernmost
part
of
Mifflin
Township
.

Piatt
Township
is
named
for
William
Piatt
who
was
an
associate
judge
in
Lycoming
County
when
the
township
was
created
.

When
colonial
settlers
first
arrived
in
what
is
now
Piatt
Township
they
were
outside
the
western
boundary
of
what
was
then
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

These
settlers
were
not
under
the
jurisiction
or
protection
of
any
type
from
any
of
the
Thirteen
Colonies
.

They
became
known
as
the
Fair
Play
Men
.

These
men
established
their
own
form
of
government
,
known
as
the
"
Fair
Play
System
"
,
with
three
elected
commissioners
who
ruled
on
land
claims
and
other
issues
for
the
group
.

In
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
Fair
Play
Men
made
their
own
Declaration
of
Independence
from
Britain
on
July
0
,
0000
beneath
the
"
Tiadaghton
Elm
"
on
the
banks
of
Pine
Creek
.

In
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
,
including
Piatt
Township
,
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

Larrys
Creek
,

near
the
mouth
of
the
creek
near
what
is
now
the
hamlet
of
Larrys
Creek
.

He
traded
with
the
indigenous
peoples
and
according
to
tradition
had
a
Native
American
wife
.

Larry
Burt
was
already
there
when
surveyors
came
through
in
0000
(
after
the
land
was
purchased
in
the
first
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
)
,
but
disappeared
sometime
soon
after
,
perhaps
moving
west
with
the
Native
Americans
who
left
the
area
.

Other
settlers
soon
followed
Larry
Burt
to
the
what
it
now
Piatt
Township
.

They
settled
along
the
banks
of
Larrys
Creek
near
where
the
creek
flows
into
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

Peter
Duffy
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
early
settlers
.

He
settled
with
his
family
at
the
mouth
of
Larrys
Creek
in
August
0000
.

Duffy
's
journey
from
County
Kildare
,
Ireland
was
a
long
and
difficult
struggle
.

He
left
from
Dublin
in
July
0000
during
the
early
years
of
the
American
Revolution
.

Duffy
was
an
acquaintance
of
Major
John
Pitcairn
.

Pitcairn
was
with
the
Royal
Marines
and
was
part
of
the
British
force
that
was
occupying
Boston
,
Massachusetts
at
the
outset
of
the
Revolution
.

Pitcairn
was
killed
at
the
Battle
of
Bunker
Hill
.

This
left
Peter
Duffy
with
a
bit
of
a
problem
.

He
no
longer
had
a
point
of
contact
in
the
Thirteen
Colonies
.

Duffy
and
his
family
landed
in
Philadelphia
in
August
0000
.

After
a
short
stay
in
the
Philadelphia
area
,
he
and
his
family
moved
further
inland
to
Lancaster
County
.

The
family
spent
seven
years
in
the
Lancaster
area
before
moving
to
Coxestown
,
know
known
as
Susquehanna
Township
,
just
north
of
Harrisburg
in
Dauphin
County
.

The
Duffy
's
owned
a
home
along
the
banks
of
the
Susquehanna
River
for
about
a
year
before
it
was
flooded
and
accidentally
burned
in
the
winter
of
0000
.

Peter
Duffy
did
not
lot
this
stop
him
.

He
gathered
is
family
and
migrated
further
still
into
the
Pennsylvania
frontier
.

The
Duffy
Family
was
joined
by
the
Stewart
Family
on
their
trip
from
Dauphin
County
to
Lycoming
County
.

Both
families
settled
down
to
the
east
of
what
is
now
Jersey
Shore
.

The
Stewarts
settled
on
the
southern
side
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
in
Nippenose
Township
and
the
Duffys
settled
on
the
opposite
shore
in
Piatt
Township
.

Peter
Duffy
built
his
home
near
where
the
Great
Shamokin
Path
crossed
Larrys
Creek
.

This
path
became
and
important
road
in
the
settlement
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
Valley
.

Early
pioneers
trekked
up
the
road
as
they
continued
to
move
ever
westward
.

Peter
Duffy
opened
an
inn
that
soon
became
an
important
stopping
point
for
the
pioneers
.

Sadly
,
Duffy
was
unable
to
enjoy
his
prominence
for
very
long
.

Late
one
evening
,
while
returning
from
a
hunt
,
a
pack
of
wolves
attacked
Peter
Duffy
along
the
Great
Shamokin
Path
.

Duffy
was
able
to
fend
off
the
wolves
and
returned
safely
home
,
but
the
cold
and
the
extreme
effort
he
put
into
defending
himself
left
him
weakened
.

He
came
down
with
a
severe
and
fatal
cold
.

Duffy
's
widow
Martha
was
left
to
manage
the
inn
with
the
help
of
her
children
.

Tragically
soon
after
Peter
's
death
,
their
first-born
son
,
James
also
died
.

James
Duffy
was
attending
a
wedding
party
at
Culbertson
's
Mill
in
Duboistown
in
February
0000
when
he
was
accidentally
killed
.

Marha
Duffy
was
left
with
her
four
remaining
children
.

Her
second
daughter
,
Catharine
,
had
married
and
moved
with
her
husband
to
Meadville
in
Crawford
County
.

The
oldest
daughter
,
Mary
Ann
,
took
over
management
of
the
inn
.

Bernard
operated
the
family
owned
sawmill
on
Pine
Creek
,
Margaret
managed
the
Duffy
family
home
,
and
Peter
,
the
son
,
managed
the
family
farm
.

These
four
Duffy
children
never
married
and
spent
the
rest
of
their
lives
living
together
in
the
family
home
in
Piatt
Township
.

The
area
of
land
along
the
West
Branch
and
Larrys
Creek
was
previously
known
as
"
Level
Corner
"
.

Many
of
the
early
settlers
were
attracted
to
this
area
of
fertile
farmland
.

Isaac
Smith
migrated
to
Piatt
Township
,
from
Chester
County
.

Smith
was
a
millwright
and
farmer
.

Robert
Covenhoven
was
another
prominent
early
settler
.

He
was
a
veteran
of
the
American
Revolution
having
fought
at
the
Battles
of
Trenton
and
Princeton
.

Covenhoven
had
returned
to
the
West
Branch
Valley
just
before
the
Big
Runaway
.

Upon
hearing
of
the
approaching
raiding
Indians
and
Loyalist
,
Covenhoven
rode
west
along
the
ridge
of
Bald
Eagle
Mountain
to
warn
settlers
at
Fort
Antes
(
opposite
what
is
now
Jersey
Shore
)
and
the
western
part
of
the
valley
.

Covenhoven
is
listed
as
a
Fair
Play
Man
and
one
of
the
signers
of
the
Tiadaghton
Declaration
of
Independence
.

Following
the
Great
Runaway
Covenhoven
continued
to
serve
as
a
scout
for
the
Patriot
forces
on
the
Pennsylvania
Frontier
.

At
the
conclusion
of
the
war
he
settled
with
his
wife
at
Level
Corner
.

They
raised
a
family
of
three
sons
and
five
daughters
.

Covenhoven
live
a
long
life
before
dying
at
the
age
of
00
.

He
is
buried
in
Northumberland
where
he
went
to
live
with
his
daughter
Nancy
after
his
wife
Mercy
's
death
.

Picture
Rocks
is
a
borough
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Picture
Rocks
is
the
birthplace
of
Warren
Sprout
,
who
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
Olympics
.

History
Picture
Rocks
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
September
00
,
0000
from
Wolf
Township
.

But
the
history
of
Picture
Rocks
began
long
before
European
settlers
first
arrived
in
0000
.

The
name
of
the
borough
is
derived
from
the
pictograph
s
that
were
left
by
some
of
the
Native
Americans
that
a
previously
inhabited
the
Muncy
Creek
valley
.

The
paintings
on
the
cliffs
above
Muncy
Creek
have
long
since
disappeared
.

The
town
is
built
upon
land
that
was
once
a
Munsee
Indian
village
.

Evidence
of
this
is
found
in
the
arrowheads
and
other
relics
that
have
been
found
in
the
vicinity
of
the
creek
.

The
first
warrant
for
property
in
the
Picture
Rocks
area
was
issued
by
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
to
Henry
Rody
on
June
0
,
0000
.

The
land
was
used
very
little
and
passed
through
several
hands
until
0000
when
it
was
sold
to
A.
R.
Sprout
and
Amos
Burrows
who
went
on
to
become
the
founding
fathers
of
Picture
Rocks
.

Sprout
and
Burrows
worked
to
clear
the
land
that
was
thought
to
be
worthless
of
the
rocks
,
logs
and
brush
that
covered
it
.

They
also
rebuilt
an
abandoned
sawmill
and
established
a
factory
that
manufactured
sashes
,
doors
,
and
window
blinds
.

This
factory
,
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
area
,
caused
a
stir
among
the
local
carpenter
s
who
believed
that
the
ready
made
building
materials
would
curtail
their
profit
making
ability
.

The
town
grew
up
around
the
factory
and
soon
other
manufacturers
arrived
to
harness
the
water
power
provided
by
Muncy
Creek
.

People
interested
in
by
a
lot
in
Picture
Rocks
were
required
to
sign
an
agreement
stating
that
they
would
not
open
a
saloon
or
engage
in
the
trafficking
of
liquor
.

This
law
was
made
by
the
residents
and
founders
of
the
town
,
a
majority
of
them
being
Baptists
.

The
Baptists
of
Picture
Rocks
organized
as
a
congregation
in
0000
and
met
for
a
while
in
a
school
house
.

A
traveling
preacher
arrived
in
Picture
Rocks
one
Saturday
evening
and
found
the
school
to
be
unfit
for
Sunday
gatherings
.

After
delivering
his
Sunday
morning
sermon
he
rallied
the
members
of
the
congregation
around
the
cause
of
building
a
proper
house
of
worship
.

Under
the
guidance
of
their
new
pastor
the
members
of
the
Baptist
Church
built
a
log
building
that
served
has
their
church
for
00
years
that
was
replaced
by
a
larger
facility
.

Pine
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Pine
Township
was
formed
from
parts
of
Brown
,
Cummings
and
Cogan
House
Townships
on
January
00
,
0000
.

It
was
originally
going
to
be
called
Kingston
Township
,
for
the
Kingston
House
what
was
in
English
Center
,
but
the
name
was
changed
to
Pine
in
recognition
of
the
vast
stands
of
pine
trees
that
covered
much
of
the
township
.

The
geography
and
geology
of
Pine
Township
have
played
an
important
role
in
its
history
.

Pine
Township
lies
within
the
southern
limits
of
the
most
recent
ice
age
.

This
land
was
once
covered
with
glacier
s.
As
the
glaciers
receded
they
scoured
the
land
creating
a
moraine
,
knob
like
hills
,
and
kettle
holes
.

Some
of
these
kettles
are
at
the
top
of
the
hill
.

This
has
caused
the
unusual
formation
of
a
swamp
at
the
top
of
a
hill
.

The
effects
of
glaciation
created
soil
characteristics
that
limited
successful
farming
and
steep
hillsides
that
also
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
farmable
land
.

Therefore
trees
have
thrived
in
Pine
Township
.

The
old-growth
forest
s
were
harvested
in
the
mid-to-late
00th
century
during
the
lumber
era
that
swept
throughout
the
hills
and
valleys
of
Pennsylvania
.

Massive
stands
of
hemlock
and
pine
were
chopped
down
and
floated
down
Little
Pine
and
Pine
Creeks
to
the
sawmill
s
of
Williamsport
.

Since
the
end
of
the
lumbering
era
and
thriving
second
growth
forest
has
grown
throughout
Pine
Township
.

John
Norris
and
his
wife
were
among
the
first
to
settle
in
Pine
Township
.

They
opened
a
"
seminary
"
or
school
for
girls
in
the
wilderness
.

During
the
years
it
was
opened
in
was
one
of
very
few
schools
in
such
a
remote
part
of
the
country
to
focus
on
educating
teen
aged
girls
.

A
failed
colony
known
as
"
English
Settlement
"
plays
a
role
in
the
history
of
northern
Lycoming
County
.

The
Reverend
John
Hey
,
who
claimed
to
be
part
of
the
"
Independent
Church
of
England
"
dreamt
of
acquiring
a
vast
amount
of
land
in
the
wilderness
and
establishing
a
utopia
.

Hey
and
some
investing
partners
acquired
of
land
for
$
00,000
in
0000
.

Hey
next
travelled
to
England
to
convince
his
countrymen
,
mostly
from
Chard
,
Somerset
,
England
,
to
settle
his
new
colony
.

Fifteen
families
agreed
to
move
to
Pine
Township
.

When
they
arrived
they
did
not
find
the
paradise
that
was
described
to
them
by
John
Hey
.

What
they
found
was
a
wilderness
of
massive
trees
,
rocks
and
rocky
soil
.

The
Englishmen
were
not
prepared
for
this
.

They
had
no
experience
with
clearing
any
land
for
farming
and
the
land
that
they
managed
to
clear
was
too
rocky
for
farming
.

The
English
Settlement
was
abandoned
ten
years
after
its
founding
.

Those
who
managed
to
survive
moved
to
more
fertile
land
in
the
nearby
area
.

The
villages
of
Oregon
Hill
and
English
Center
were
founded
by
survivors
of
the
failed
English
Settlement
.

Oregon
Hill
was
the
location
of
two
churches
,
a
blacksmith
shop
,
and
two
stores
along
with
several
homes
.

The
settlers
of
Oregon
Hill
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
land
in
the
area
was
fertile
unlike
much
of
the
surrounding
land
.

English
Center
on
Little
Pine
Creek
was
a
milling
town
.

The
English
Center
Suspension
Bridge
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Plunketts
Creek
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

It
includes
the
villages
of
Barbours
and
Proctor
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Colonial
and
Revolutionary
era
Plunketts
Creek
Township
was
formed
from
parts
of
Franklin
Township
,
Lycoming
County
and
what
is
now
Davidson
Township
,
Sullivan
County
by
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
during
its
December
sessions
of
0000
.

The
township
was
once
much
larger
in
size
,
more
than
a
few
townships
in
both
Lycoming
and
Sullivan
Counties
have
been
carved
from
what
was
once
Plunketts
Creek
Township
.

The
township
is
named
for
Plunketts
Creek
which
is
a
tributary
of
Loyalsock
Creek
.

The
creek
is
in
turn
named
for
Colonel
William
Plunkett
who
was
a
frontier
doctor
and
militia
officer
during
the
pre-Revolution
years
in
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

He
was
noted
for
his
skill
in
dressing
the
wounds
of
pioneers
who
had
been
scalped
by
both
the
French
and
Indians
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

Plunkett
was
also
a
veteran
of
the
Pennamite-Yankee
War
which
pitted
settlers
from
Connecticut
to
the
Wyoming
Valley
of
Pennsylvania
against
those
who
had
been
established
in
Pennsylvania
prior
to
the
Connecticut
settlers
arrival
.

He
received
title
to
land
at
what
is
now
the
mouth
of
Plunketts
Creek
.

Therefore
the
land
surrounding
the
creek
was
generally
known
as
"
Plunketts
Creek
"
.

The
township
was
to
originally
be
called
Plunkett
Township
.

Some
residents
of
the
township
did
not
approve
of
this
name
.

They
questioned
William
Plunkett
's
loyalty
for
he
had
remained
largely
"
passive
"
regarding
the
American
Revolution
.

Some
believed
that
he
sympathized
with
the
cause
of
the
Tories
during
the
Revolution
.

A
compromise
was
reached
by
naming
it
Plunketts
Creek
Township
.

While
others
wanted
to
honor
one
of
the
first
and
most
important
settlers
to
the
area
.

The
first
white
man
to
live
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
was
a
man
with
the
surname
of
Paulhamus
.

Tradition
states
that
he
was
deserter
during
the
Revolutionary
War
.

He
fled
from
the
Red
coats
and
cleared
a
small
piece
of
land
in
the
wilderness
along
Loyalsock
Creek
near
the
mouth
of
Bear
Creek
.

Paulhamus
was
a
squatter
on
the
land
from
0000
until
0000
when
it
is
thought
that
he
was
forced
to
rejoin
the
British
Army
.

Permanent
settlers
did
not
arrive
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
until
0000
.

Three
men
Donelly
,
Smith
and
Payne
found
the
cabin
that
had
been
abandoned
by
Paulhamus
.

They
expanded
Paulhamus
'
improvements
and
began
farming
,
fishing
and
hunting
in
the
area
.

Logging
and
tanning
era
Logging
was
the
principal
industry
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
during
the
mid-to-late
00th
century
.

Thousands
of
acres
of
old-growth
forest
were
harvested
and
floated
down
Loyalsock
Creek
and
its
tributaries
to
one
of
the
many
sawmill
s
that
had
sprung
up
throughout
Lycoming
County
.

There
were
several
sawmills
in
Barbours
,
a
village
along
Loyalsock
Creek
,
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
.

In
0000
John
Barbour
built
a
sawmill
on
Loyalsock
Creek
near
the
mouth
of
Plunketts
Creek
.

This
developed
into
the
village
of
Barbours
Mills
,
today
known
as
Barbours
.

In
the
00th
century
,
Barbours
had
several
blacksmith
s
,
a
temperance
hotel
,
post
office
,
many
sawmills
,
a
school
,
store
and
wagon
maker
.

In
0000
,
a
road
was
built
north
from
Barbours
along
Plunketts
Creek
,
crossing
it
several
times
.

This
is
the
earliest
possible
date
for
construction
of
the
bridge
,
but
the
surviving
county
road
docket
on
the
construction
does
not
mention
either
bridges
or
fords
for
crossing
the
creek
.

The
bridge
is
at
the
mouth
of
Coal
Mine
Hollow
,
and
the
road
it
was
on
was
used
by
the
lumber
and
coal
industries
,
which
were
active
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
during
the
00th
century
and
early
00th
century
.

Creeks
in
the
township
supplied
water
power
to
00
mills
in
0000
,
and
in
0000
there
were
00
sawmills
,
a
shingle
mill
,
a
wool
en
factory
,
and
a
tannery
there
.

These
industries
supported
the
inhabitants
of
two
villages
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
by
the
latter
half
of
the
00th
century
.

In
0000
the
village
of
Proctorville
was
built
as
a
company
town
for
Thomas
E.
Proctor
's
tannery
.

Proctor
,
as
it
is
now
known
,
is
north
of
Barbours
along
Plunketts
Creek
.

The
bark
from
Eastern
hemlock
trees
was
used
in
the
tanning
process
,
and
the
village
originally
sat
in
the
midst
of
vast
forests
of
hemlock
.

The
tannery
employed
"
several
hundred
"
at
wages
between
00
cents
and
US$
0.00
a
day
.

These
employees
lived
in
one
hundred
twenty
company
houses
,
which
each
rented
for
$
0
a
month
.

In
0000
,
Proctor
had
a
barber
shop
,
two
blacksmiths
,
cigar
stand
,
I.O.O.F
hall
,
leather
shop
,
news
stand
,
a
post
office
(
established
in
0000
)
,
a
two-room
school
,
two
stores
,
and
a
wagon
shop
.

Hemlock
bark
,
used
in
the
tanning
process
,
was
hauled
to
the
tannery
from
up
to
away
in
both
summer
and
winter
,
using
wagons
and
sleds
.

The
hides
which
were
tanned
to
make
leather
came
from
the
United
States
,
and
as
far
away
as
Mexico
,
Argentina
,
and
China
.

Finished
sole
leather
was
hauled
by
horse-drawn
wagon
south
about
to
Little
Bear
Creek
,
where
it
was
exchanged
for
"
green
"
hides
and
other
supplies
brought
north
from
Montoursville
.

The
lumber
boom
on
Plunketts
Creek
ended
when
the
virgin
timber
ran
out
.

By
0000
,
the
old
growth
hemlock
was
exhausted
and
the
Proctor
tannery
,
then
owned
by
the
Elk
Tanning
Company
,
was
closed
and
dismantled
.

00th
century
Without
timber
and
the
tannery
,
the
populations
of
Proctor
and
Barbours
declined
.

The
Barbours
post
office
closed
in
the
0000s
and
the
Proctor
post
office
closed
on
July
0
,
0000
.

Both
villages
also
lost
their
schools
and
almost
all
of
their
businesses
.

Proctor
celebrated
its
centennial
in
0000
,
and
a
0000
newspaper
article
on
its
thirty-ninth
annual
"
Proctor
Homecoming
"
reunion
called
it
a
"
near-deserted
old
tannery
town
"
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
last
store
in
Barbours
closed
,
and
the
former
hotel
(
which
had
become
a
hunting
club
)
was
torn
down
to
make
way
for
a
new
bridge
across
Loyalsock
Creek
.

Plunketts
Creek
Township
has
been
a
place
for
both
lumber
and
tourism
since
its
villages
were
founded
,
and
as
industry
declined
,
nature
recovered
.

Second
growth
forest
s
have
since
covered
most
of
the
clear-cut
land
.

Pennsylvania
's
state
legislature
authorized
the
acquisition
of
abandoned
and
clear-cut
land
for
Pennsylvania
State
Game
Lands
in
0000
,
and
the
Pennsylvania
Game
Commission
(
PGC
)
acquired
property
along
Plunketts
Creek
for
State
Game
Lands
Number
000
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
main
entrance
to
State
Game
Lands
000
is
just
north
of
the
bridge
site
,
on
the
east
side
of
the
creek
.

The
PGC
established
the
Northcentral
State
Game
Farm
in
0000
on
part
of
State
Game
Lands
000
to
raise
wild
turkey
.

The
farm
was
converted
to
ringneck
pheasant
production
in
0000
,
and
,
,
it
was
one
of
four
Pennsylvania
state
game
farms
producing
about
000,000
pheasants
each
year
for
release
on
land
open
to
public
hunting
.

The
Northcentral
State
Game
Farm
is
chiefly
in
the
Plunketts
Creek
valley
,
just
south
of
Proctor
and
north
of
the
bridge
.

The
opening
weekend
of
the
trout
season
brings
more
people
into
the
village
of
Barbours
at
the
mouth
of
Plunketts
Creek
than
any
other
time
of
the
year
.

The
Bridge
in
Plunketts
Creek
Township
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic

in

,
but
delisted
in

,
after
washed
out
by
a

Porter
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Porter
Township
,
named
for
David
R.
Porter
,
governor
of
Pennsylvania
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
was
formed
from
part
of
Mifflin
Township
on
May
0
,
0000
.

When
colonial
settlers
first
arrived
in
what
is
now
Porter
Township
they
were
outside
the
western
boundary
of
what
was
then
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

These
settlers
were
not
under
the
jurisiction
or
protection
of
any
type
from
any
of
the
Thirteen
Colonies
.

They
became
known
as
the
Fair
Play
Men
.

These
men
established
their
own
form
of
government
,
known
as
the
"
Fair
Play
System
"
,
with
three
elected
commissioners
who
ruled
on
land
claims
and
other
issues
for
the
group
.

In
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
Fair
Play
Men
made
their
own
Declaration
of
Independence
from
Britain
on
July
0
,
0000
beneath
the
"
Tiadaghton
Elm
"
on
the
banks
of
Pine
Creek
.

During
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

Dr.
James
Davidson
,
a
veteran
of
the
American
Revolution
,
served
as
a
doctor
for
General
Anthony
Wayne
's
army
,
was
one
of
the
first
and
most
successful
settlers
in
the
Porter
Township
area
.

He
settled
in
the
Sunbury
just
after
the
Revolution
.

After
several
years
in
that
vicinity
he
bought
a
farm
along
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
in
what
is
now
western
Lycoming
County
.

Here
he
farmed
and
also
served
as
the
only
doctor
in
the
area
for
many
years
.

Dr.
Davidson
built
one
of
the
first
brick
houses
in
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
Valley
.

He
also
served
as
a
judge
for
Lycoming
County
after
it
was
formed
in

South
Williamsport
is
a
borough
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

It
is
famous
for
hosting
the
Little
League
World
Series
.

The
population
was
0,000
at

0000
census

It
is
part

the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area

History
South
Williamsport
celebrated
the
centennial
of
its
incorporation
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
the
Lycoming
County
court
incorporated
the
villages
of
Rocktown
,
Billman
,
and
vicinities
as
the
borough
of
South
Williamsport
.

The
land
had
previously
been
part
of
Armstrong
Township
.

The
first
recorded
inhabitants
of
the
Susquehanna
River
valley
were
the
Iroquoian
speaking
Susquehannock
s.
Their
name
meant
"
people
of
the
muddy
river
"
in
Algonquian
.

Decimated
by
disease
s
and
war
fare
,
they
had
died
out
,
moved
away
,
or
been
assimilated
into
other
tribes
by
the
early
00th
century
.

The
lands
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
valley
were
then
chiefly
occupied
by
the
Munsee
clan
or
phratry
of
the
Lenape
,
and
were
under
the
nominal
control
of
the
Five
(
later
Six
)
Nations
of
the
Iroquois
.

The
British
purchased
land
from
the
Iroquois
in
the
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
of
0000
,
opening
what
is
now
Lycoming
County
to
settlement
.

After
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
Lycoming
County
was
formed
from
Northumberland
County
,
on
April
00
,
0000
.

The
county
's
area
was
originally
over
and
several
other
counties
were
subsequently
formed
from
it
.

Williamsport
,
across
the
river
from
South
Williamsport
,
was
also
founded
in
0000
and
chosen
as
the
county
seat
.

The
first
settler
in
what
is
now
South
Williamsport
is
believed
to
have
been
Aaron
Hagerman
,
a
transplanted
Holland
er
,
who
is
thought
to
have
arrived
shortly
after
the
end
of
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.

Hagermans
Run
,
which
flows
through
the
borough
,
bears
his
name
.

One
of
the
predecessor
communities
was
"
Rocktown
"
.

And
another
was
Bootstown
.

One
of
the
first
businesses
was
a
tavern
established
near
the
mouth
of
Hagermans
Run
by
Michael
McDonough
.

Another
early
entrepreneur
,
Jacob
Weiss
,
gave
the
village
a
push
toward
borough
status
by
purchasing
a
tract
of
00
acre
s
and
laying
out
town
lots
.

Weiss
also
established
a
brickyard
near
McDonough
’s
tavern
and
for
many
years
operated
an
oil
mill
and
a
gristmill
.

From
those
early
times
to
the
present
,
South
Williamsport
’s
fortunes
have
been
linked
to
those
of
Williamsport
.

Sawmill
s
and
furniture
factories
were
among
the
most
prosperous
industries
in
both
communities
.

Planing
mills
and
woodworking
factories
of
all
types
reached
a
peak
of
activity
during
the
logging
boom
of
the
post
-
Civil
War
years
of
the
last
century
.

The
industry
gradually
declined
in
the
0000s
when
the
surrounding
hills
were
finally
stripped
of
saleable
lumber
and
the
logging
crews
moved
west
.

Today
Today
,
manufacturing
diversity
is
the
rule
.

The
area
is
reforested
with
second-growth
timber
,
providing
scenic
beauty
as
well
as
woodland
recreational
opportunities
.

Susquehanna
Township
was
first
surveyed
in
0000
.

The

named
it
"
Upper
Bottom
"
to
distinguish
from
a
piece
of
land
further
to
the
east
that
was
named
"
Lower
Bottom
"
,
present
day
Duboistown
and

where
against

they
were
less

Pollock
was
a

Washington
Township
is
a
township
in
Lycoming
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Washington
Township
was
formed
as
part
of
Northumberland
County
in
0000
.

It
originally
extended
from
White
Deer
Hole
Creek
north
to
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
with
its
eastern
boundary
also
formed
by
the
west
branch
.

The
western
limit
was
ambiguous
,
but
most
historians
assumed
that
the
western
boundary
followed
a
line
that
extended
to
the
south
opposite
the
mouth
of
Pine
Creek
in
what
is
now
eastern
Clinton
County
.

Washington
Township
is
older
than
Lycoming
County
.

Therefore
it
was
one
of
the
original
townships
in
Lycoming
County
.

Seven
additional
townships
were
created
from
land
that
was
originally
part
of
Washington
Township
.

They
are
Armstrong
,
Bastress
,
Brady
,
Clinton
,
Limestone
,
Nippenose
,
and
Susquehanna
Townships
.

The
township
is
named
for
the
hero
of
the
American
Revolution
and
the
0st
President
of
the
United
States
,
George
Washington
.

Historically
,
two
trails
of
the
native
indigenous
peoples
ran
along
parts
of
White
Deer
Hole
Creek
in
Washington
Township
.

Settlers
arrived
by
0000
,
but
fled
in
0000
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
during
The
Big
Runaway
.

They
returned
and
the
creek
served
as
the
southern
boundary
of
Lycoming
County
and
Washington
Township
when
it
was
formed
in
0000
.

A
logging
railroad
ran
along
the
creek
from
0000
to
0000
for
timber
clearcutting
and
small-scale
lumbering
continues
.

The
Great
Island
Path
was
a
major
trail
that
ran
north
along
the
Susquehanna
River
from
the
Saponi
village
of
Shamokin
at
modern
Sunbury
,
fording
the
river
there
and
following
the
west
bank
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
north
until
White
Deer
Hole
valley
.

The
path
turned
west
at
Allenwood
and
followed
White
Deer
Hole
Creek
until
about
the
present
location
of
Elimsport
in
Washington
Township
.

There
it
headed
northwest
,
crossed
North
White
Deer
Ridge
and
passed
west
through
the
Nippenose
valley
,
then
turned
north
and
crossed
Bald
Eagle
Mountain
via
McElhattan
Creek
and
ran
along
the
south
bank
of
the
river
to
the
Great
Island
(
near
the
present
day
city
of
Lock
Haven
)
.

In
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
Big
Runaway
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Settlers
abandoned
their
homes
and
fields
,
drove
their
livestock
south
,
and
towed
their
possessions
on
rafts
on
the
river
to
Sunbury
.

Their
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Beginning
with
the
first
settlers
,
much
of
the
land
along
White
Deer
Hole
Creek
in
Washington
Township
was
slowly
cleared
of
timber
.

Small
sawmills
were
built
in
the
00th
century
,
and
a
much
larger
lumber
operation
was
run
by
the
Vincent
Lumber
Company
from
0000
to
0000
.

They
built
a
narrow
gauge
railroad
from
Elimsport
west
into
timber
,
and
a
line
east
to
Allenwood
in
Union
County
and
the
Reading
Railroad
there
.

The
lumber
railroad
ran
parallel
to
the
creek
,
with
the
end
of
the
track
near
the
Fourth
Gap
.

It
was
incorporated
on
June
00
,
0000
(
around
the
time
of
construction
)
as
the
"
Allenwood
and
Western
Railroad
"
.

The
lumbering
operation
ceased
in
0000
when
the
forests
were
gone
.

The
railroad
was
torn
up
,
and
its
one
second-hand
Shay
locomotive
was
moved
to
the
Vincent
Lumber
Company
operation
at
Denholm
(
in
Juniata
County
)
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
much
of
what
is
now
Tiadaghton
State
Forest
was
purchased
by
Pennsylvania
from
lumber
companies
that
had
no
further
use
for
the
clear-cut
land
.

In
the
0000s
there
were
seven
Civilian
Conservation
Corps
camps
to
construct
roads
and
trails
in
the
forest
.

On
May
00
,
0000
around
00:00
pm
a
tornado
tore
through
the
eastern
part
of
the
township
and
went
through
the
State
Gamelands
(
Old
Alvira
)
and
continued
into
Union
County
with
no
warning
.

Twelve
people
were
injured
and
one
was
killed
.

Small-scale
lumbering
continues
in
the
Washington
Township
,
but
the
forest
is
certified
as
well-managed
"
in
an
environmentally
sensitive
manner
"
and
lumber
from
it
qualifies
for
a
"
green
label
"
.

An
Amish-owned
and
operated
sawmill
is
on
Pennsylvania
Route
00
in
Elimsport
.

It
burned
down
on
May
00
,
0000
(
causing
$
000,000
in
damages
)
but
was
expected
to
be
back
in
operation
in
a
month
.

Despite
this
small-scale
lumbering
,
as
of
0000
the
forests
have
grown
back
and
are
mixed
oak
,
with
blueberry
and
mountain
laurel
bushes
.

White
Deer
Hole
Creek
and
its
tributaries
also
have
stands
of
hemlock
and
thickets
of
rhododendron
along
them
.

mountainous
and
covered
with
a

forest
.

During

late
0000s
much

the
land
was
stripped

its
old-growth
forest
s.
At

time
central
Pennsylvania
,
and
the
city
of
Williamsport
was
the
center
of
the

Trees
were
cut
down
and
floated
down
Pine
Creek
,
which
flows
through
Watson

.

There
were
several
sawmills
along
Pine
Creek
in
the

at
industry
included
an
iron
forge
along
Furnace

There
were
several
deposits

iron
ore
in

The
ore
proved
to
be
of

and
sound

Alec
John
Such

Bed

Roses
"
as
the
most
successful
single
of
the
album
,
peaking
at
number
ten
on
the
US
Billboard
Hot
000
.

Background
Following
the
completion
of
the
New
Jersey
tour
,
the
band
went
on
hiatus
.

During
their
time
off
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
wrote
the
soundtrack
for
Young
Guns
II
,
which
was
released
in
0000
as
the
Blaze
of
Glory
album
and
Richie
Sambora
released
his
first
solo
album
called
Stranger
in
This
Town
.

By
this
time
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
fired
his
longtime
manager
,
Doc
McGhee
and
created
Bon
Jovi
Management
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
decided
to
take
on
a
larger
role
,
and
more
responsibilities
within
the
band
.

In
October
0000
the
band
went
to
a
Caribbean
island
of
St.
Thomas
to
discuss
plans
for
the
future
;
the
band
's
internal
problems
were
solved
and
they
were
ready
to
have
a
go
at
a
comeback
.

Recording
and
production
In
January
0000
the
band
headed
to
Little
Mountain
Studios
in
Vancouver
.

They
spent
seven
months
making
the
album
with
Bob
Rock
producing
.

Originally
the
band
had
approached
Bruce
Fairbairn
to
produce
the
album
who
produced
Slippery
When
Wet
and
New
Jersey
,
but
he
was
working
on
Aerosmith
's
album
.

Most
of
the
recording
was
done
in
Vancouver
,
although
a
couple
of
tracks
were
laid
down
in
Los
Angeles
along
with
some
over-dubs
.

According
to
an
interview
with
Jon
Bon
Jovi
,
the
album
's
original
title
was
to
be
"
Revenge
"
.

Of
the
thirty
songs
written
for
the
album
,
two
were
written
with
Desmond
Child
,
a
couple
were
by
David
Bryan
and
the
rest
being
made
up
of
Jon
Bon
Jovi/Richie
Sambora
compositions
and
those
written
solely
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
.

00
songs
are
make
it
to
the
final
cut
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
alone
wrote
most
of
the
album
because
,
as
he
says
,
"
This
was
my
way
of
trying
to
keep
things
together
.
"

According
to
Richie
Sambora
,
his
own
input
had
to
be
limited
,
because
he
'd
been
supporting
his
solo
album
.

Before
the
band
reunited
in
the
studio
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
spent
the
summer
of
0000
in
anonymity
,
riding
his
bike
in
places
like
Arizona
,
gaining
experiences
that
inspired
him
to
write
"
Dry
County
"
and
"
Bed
Of
Roses
"
.

He
later
commented
"
It
would
never
have
been
possible
[
for
me
]
to
write
songs
like
"
Bed
of
Roses
"
or
"
Dry
County
"
five
years
ago
.
"

Jon
Bon
Jovi
started
to
writing
of
"
Bed
Of
Roses
"
in
a
hotel
room
in
Los
Angeles
.

He
brought
a
piano
to
his
room
that
the
hotel
used
for
weddings
.

The
first
verse
reflects
what
he
was
feeling
when
he
was
trying
to
write
this
.

He
was
badly
hung
over
from
the
night
before
,
but
had
a
piano
in
his
hotel
room
and
was
determined
to
write
something
.

This
is
a
personal
song
that
he
feels
exposes
a
lot
of
the
problems
he
was
experiencing
at
the
time
.

According
to
Jon
Bon
Jovi
,
"
Dry
County
"
was
probably
the
first
and
last
song
written
for
this
album
.

But
it
was
n’t
until
near
the
end
of
recording
everything
that
it
was
finally
pieced
together
to
end
up
.

That
song
is
the
story
of
his
motorcycle
trip
with
images
that
he
saw
in
small
towns
where
he
’d
see
guys
sitting
outside
bars
way
too
early
in
the
day
,
drinking
their
lives
away
because
they
have
no
chance
of
getting
a
job
.

It
really
hit
him
what
the
effect
of
"
Reaganomics
"
has
been
.

Richie
Sambora
said
that
"
Keep
The
Faith
recognises
how
tough
the
nineties
are
and
tries
to
encourage
a
positive
message
in
these
difficult
times
.
"

I
Believe
"
is
kind
of
serious
too
.

It
destroys
the
myth
of
idolatry
.

The
message
is
that
people
should
believe
in
themselves
,
not
images
they
see
on
TV
"
.
"

If
I
Was
Your
Mother
"
is
about
a
guy
who
is
obsessive
about
his
relationship
with
his
girlfriend
.

So
obsessive
in
fact
that
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
he
could
get
closer
to
her
would
be
by
being
the
girl
’s
mother
.

It
’s
the
heaviest
song
on
the
record
.

In
These
Arms
was
the
last
song
they
wrote
for
the
album
.

Bob
Rock
pushed
them
to
write
one
more
song
and
it
was
the
only
song
on
the
album
which
was
written
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
,
David
Bryan
and
Richie
Sambora
.

Release
and
reception
In
the
US
,
Keep
The
Faith
debuted
at
number
five
on
the
Billboard
000
Top
Albums
on
November
0000
.

It
fell
to
number
seven
the
following
week
.

In
January
0000
,
the
Recording
Industry
Association
of
America
(
RIAA
)
certified
it
platinum
.

The
album
was
viewed
as
a
commercial
disappointment
,
despite
surpassing
the
0
million
sales
mark
in
two
months
.

As
Jon
Bon
Jovi
said
:
"
When
the
record
came
out
in
America
and
it
did
n’t
come
in
at
number
one
,
people
were
very
quick
to
say
it
was
over
.

But
it
was
like
,
if
it
’s
done
,
it
’s
been
a
pretty
good
ten
years
.

It
took
two
or
three
singles
to
get
it
up
over
two
million
in
America
-
which
is
n’t
too
bad
for
a
failure
.

So
there
were
new
rhythms
,
especially
in
the
album
's
title
track
,
along
with
a
new
kind
of
social
concern
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
the
band
's
career
,
the
fans
did
n't
immediately
respond
.

I
hoped
it
was
going
to
be
wow
,
look
at
the
chances
the
band
took
.

But
you
knew
when
you
played
St.
Louis
and
broke
into
the
new
songs
and
nobody
moved
,
that
was
n't
what
you
'd
been
used
to
.

I
had
to
go
out
there
and
prove
"
Keep
The
Faith
"
was
a
good
song
.
"

The
album
was
even
more
successful
on
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
peaking
at
number
one
in
the
UK
and
reaching
gold
status
in
Germany
in
its
first
week
.
"

Keep
The
Faith
"
had
sold
twice
as
good
as
"
Slippery
When
Wet
"
and
"
New
Jersey
"
,
selling
over
a
million
copies
in
Germany
.

It
was
the
second
best
selling
album
of
0000
in
Germany
.

In
Canada
,
the
album
certified
five
times
platinum
by
CRIA
and
nominated
for
best
selling
album
of
the
year
at
the
Juno
Awards
.

By
the
end
of
0000
,
Keep
The
Faith
had
sold
0
million
copies
worldwide
.

In
October
0000
,
the
Recording
Industry
Association
of
America
(
RIAA
)
certified
the
album
double
platinum
.

The
singles
success
of
Keep
The
Faith
was
more
successful
overseas
than
in
Bon
Jovi
's
native
United
States
:
in

six

the
singles
from
the
album
all

the

the
most

there
.

"

History
Wolf
Township
was
formed
from
part
of
Muncy
Township
by
the
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
in
September
0000
.

The
township
is
named
for
George
Wolf
who
was
the
governor
of
Pennsylvania
from
0000
to
0000
.

The
boroughs
of
Hughesville
and
Picture
Rocks
are
on
land
that
was
taken
from
Wolf
Township
.

Wolf
Township
today
has
grown
to
a
population
of
0,000
residents
as
of
the
0000
census
.

This
is
up
from
000
residents
at
the
census
of
0000
.

Quarries
The
geology
of
Wolf
Township
played
a
role
in
its
history
.

Limestone
was
quarried
west
of
Hughesville
for
use
as
lime
.

Lime
is
used
in
large
quantities
as
building
and
engineering
materials
(
including
limestone
products
,
concrete
and
mortar
)
and
as
chemical
feedstocks
,
among
other
uses
.

Lime
industries
and
the
use
of
many
of
the
resulting
products
date
from
prehistoric
periods
in
both
the
Old
World
and
the
New
World
.

Wolf
Township
was
also
the
home
to
several
Pennsylvania
Bluestone
quarries
.

Pennsylvania
Bluestone
has
many
uses
,
from
cut
dimensional
stone
used
in
patios
,
walkways
and
stair
treads
to
architectural
stone
used
in
buildings
.

It
is
also
used
for
wallstone
,
decorative
boulders
,
natural
steps
and
other
landscape
features
.

The
name
"
Pennsylvania
Bluestone
"
is
due
to
its
predominantly
blue
color
and
because
the
majority
of
stone
is
quarried
in
Pennsylvania
.

Early
settlers
and
industry
David
Aspen
was
the
first
white
settler
to
live
within
the
borders
of
what
is
now
Wolf
Township
.

He
was
scalped
during
American
Revolutionary
War
,
when
his
and
other
settlements
throughout
the
Susquehanna
valley
were
attacked
by
Loyalists
and
Native
Americans
allied
with
the
British
.

After
the
Wyoming
Valley
battle
and
massacre
in
the
summer
of
0000
(
near
what
is
now
Wilkes-Barre
)
and
smaller
local
attacks
,
the
"
Big
Runaway
"
occurred
throughout
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
Valley
.

Settlers
fled
feared
and
actual
attacks
by
the
British
and
their
allies
.

Homes
and
fields
were
abandoned
,
with
livestock
driven
along
and
a
few
possessions
floated
on
rafts
on
the
river
east
to
Muncy
,
then
further
south
to
Sunbury
.

The
abandoned
property
was
burnt
by
the
attackers
.

Some
settlers
soon
returned
,
only
to
flee
again
in
the
summer
of
0000
in
the
"
Little
Runaway
"
.

Sullivan
's
Expedition
helped
stabilize
the
area
and
encouraged
resettlement
,
which
continued
after
the
war
.

Abraham
Webster
was
another
of
the
early
settlers
to
be
attacked
,
only
he
survived
and
returned
to
Wolf
Township
twelve
years
after
the
Big
Runaway
.

His
entire
family
had
been
killed
but
he
returned
with
a
new
wife
and
re-established
his
home
.

The
earliest
industrial
venture
in
Wolf
Township
was
a
gristmill
constructed
in
0000
.

A
wool
carding
mill
was
built
in
0000
.

There
were
also
several
sawmills
in
the
township
that
were
part
of
the
lumber
industry
that
covered
much
of
Pennsylvania
during
the
late
0000s
.

by
dividing
Anthony
Township
.

It
is
named
for
Apollos
Woodward
who
was
an

When
Woodward
township
was

settled
by
migrants
from
Europe
it
was
outside

of
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

These
settlers
were
not

Surfactants
are
compounds
that
lower
the
surface
tension
of
a
liquid
,
the
interfacial
tension
between
two
liquids
,
or
that
between
a
liquid
and
a
solid
.

Surfactants
may
act
as
detergents
,
wetting
agent
s
,
emulsifiers
,
foaming
agent
s
,
and
dispersant
s.
Etymology
and
definition
The
term
surfactant/surfactants
is
a
blend
of
surface
active
agents
.

In
Index
Medicus
and
the
United
States
National
Library
of
Medicine
,
surfactant/surfactants
is
reserved
for
the
meaning
pulmonary
surfactant
.

For
the
more
general
meaning
,
surface
active
agent/s
is
the
heading
.

Composition
and
structure
Surfactants
are
usually
organic
compound
s
that
are
amphiphilic
,
meaning
they
contain
both
hydrophobic
groups
(
their
tails
)
and
hydrophilic
groups
(
their
heads
)
.

Therefore
,
a
surfactant
contains
both
a
water
insoluble
(
or
oil
soluble
)
component
and
a
water
soluble
component
.

Surfactants
will
diffuse
in
water
and
adsorb
at
interfaces
between
air
and
water
or
at
the
interface
between
oil
and
water
,
in
the
case
where
water
is
mixed
with
oil
.

The
insoluble
hydrophobic
group
may
extend
out
of
the
bulk
water
phase
,
into
the
air
or
into
the
oil
phase
,
while
the
water
soluble
head
group
remains
in
the
water
phase
.

This
alignment
of
surfactants
at
the
surface
modifies
the
surface
properties
of
water
at
the
water/air
or
water/oil
interface
.

World
production
of
surfactants
is
estimated
at
00
Mton/y
,
of
which
about
half
are
soaps
.

Other
surfactants
produced
on
a
particularly
large
scale
are
linear
alkylbenzenesulfonate
s
(
0000
kton/y
)
,
lignin
sulfonate
s
(
000
kton/y
)
,
fatty
alcohol
ethoxylate
s
(
000
ktons/y
)
,
and
alkylphenol
ethoxylate
s
(

kton/y
)

Structure
of
surfactant
phases
in
water
In
the
bulk
aqueous
phase
,
surfactants
form
aggregates
,
such
as
micelles
,
where
the
hydrophobic
tails
form
the
core
of
the
aggregate
and
the
hydrophilic
heads
are
in
contact
with
the
surrounding
liquid
.

Other
types
of
aggregates
such
as
spherical
or
cylindrical
micelles
or
bilayers
can
be
formed
.

The
shape
of
the
aggregates
depends
on
the
chemical
structure
of
the
surfactants
,
depending
on
the
balance
of
the
sizes
of
the
hydrophobic
tail
and
hydrophilic
head
.

This
is
known
as
the
HLB
,
Hydrophilic-lipophilic
balance
.

Surfactants
reduce
the
surface
tension
of
water
by
adsorbing
at
the
liquid-gas
interface
.

The
relation
that
links
the
surface
tension
and
the
surface
excess
is
known
as
the
Gibbs
isotherm
.

Dynamics
of
surfactants
at
interfaces
The
dynamics
of
adsorption
of
surfactants
is
of
great
importance
for
practical
applications
such
as
foaming
,
emulsifying
or
coating
processes
,
where
bubbles
or
drops
are
rapidly
generated
and
need
to
be
stabilized
.

The
dynamics
of
adsorption
depends
on
the
diffusion
coefficient
of
the
surfactants
.

Indeed
,
as
the
interface
is
created
,
the
adsorption
is
limited
by
the
diffusion
of
the
surfactants
to
the
interface
.

In
some
cases
,
there
exists
a
barrier
of
energy
for
the
adsorption
or
the
desorption
of
the
surfactants
,
then
the
adsorption
dynamics
is
known
as
‘
kinetically
limited
'
.

Such
energy
barrier
can
be
due
to
steric
or
electrostatic
repulsions
.

The
surface
rheology
of
surfactant
layers
,
including
the
elasticity
and
viscosity
of
the
surfactant
layers
plays
a
very
important
role
in
foam
or
emulsion
stability
.

Characterization
of
interfaces
and
surfactant
layers
Interfacial
and
surface
tension
can
be
characterized
by
classical
methods
such
as
the
-
pendant
or
spinning
drop
method
Dynamic
surface
tensions
,
i.e.
surface
tension
as
a
function
of
time
,
can
be
obtained
by
the
Maximum
Bubble
Pressure
apparatus
The
structure
of
surfactant
layers
can
be
studied
by
ellipsometry
or
X-Ray
reflectivity
.

Surface
rheology
can
be
characterized
by
the
oscillating
drop
method
or
shear
surface
rheometers
such
as
double-cone
,
double-ring
or
magnetic
rod
shear
surface
rheometer
.

Detergents
in
biochemistry
and
biotechnology
In
solution
,
detergents
help
solubilize
a
variety
of
chemical
species
by
dissociating
aggregates
and
unfolding
proteins
.

Popular
surfactants
in
the
biochemistry
laboratory
are
SDS
and
CTAB
.

Detergents
are
key
reagents
to
extract
protein
by
lysis
of
the
cells
and
tissues
:
They
disorganize
the
membrane
's
lipidic
bilayer
(
SDS
,
Triton
X-000
,
X-000
,
CHAPS
,
DOC
,
and
NP-00
)
,
and
solubilize
proteins
.

Milder
detergents
such
as
(
OctylThioGlucosides
)
are
used
to
solubilize
sensible
proteins
(
enzymes
,
receptors
)
.

Non-solubilized
material
is
harvested
by
centrifugation
or
other
means
.

For
electrophoresis
,
for
example
,
proteins
are
classically
treated
with
SDS
to
denature
the
native
tertiary
and
quaternary
structures
,
allowing
the
separation
of
proteins
according
to
their
molecular
weight
.

Detergents
have
also
been
used
to
decellularise
organs
.

This
process
maintains
a
matrix
of
proteins
that
preserves
the
structure
of
the
organ
and
often
the
microvascular
network
.

The
process
has
been
successfully
used
to
prepare
organs
such
as
the
liver
and
heart
for
transplant
in
rats
.

Pulmonary
surfactant
s
are
also
naturally
secreted
by
type
II
cells
of
the
lung
alveoli
in
mammals
.

Classification
of
surfactants
The
"
tail
"
of
most
surfactants
are
fairly
similar
,
consisting
of
a
hydrocarbon
chain
,
which
can
be
branch
,
linear
,
or
aromatic
.

Fluorosurfactant
s
have
fluorocarbon
chains
.

Siloxane
surfactant
s
have
siloxane
chains
.

Many
important
surfactants
include
a
polyether
chain
terminating
in
a
highly
polar
anionic
group
.

The
polyether
groups
often
comprise
ethoxylated
(
polyethylene
oxide
-
like
)
sequences
inserted
to
increase
the
hydrophilic
character
of
a
surfactant
.

Polypropylene
oxide
s
conversely
,
may
be
inserted
to
increase
the
lipophilic
character
of
a
surfactant
.

Surfactant
molecules
have
either
one
tail
or
two
;
those
with
two
tails
are
said
to
be
double-chained
.

Most
commonly
,
surfactants
are
classified
according
to
polar
head
group
.

A
non-ionic
surfactant
has
no
charge
groups
in
its
head
.

The
head
of
an
ionic
surfactant
carries
a
net
charge
.

If
the
charge
is
negative
,
the
surfactant
is
more
specifically
called
anionic
;
if
the
charge
is
positive
,
it
is
called
cationic
.

If
a
surfactant
contains
a
head
with
two
oppositely
charged
groups
,
it
is
termed
zwitterionic
.

Commonly
encountered
surfactants
of
each
type
include
:
Anionic
Sulfate
,
sulfonate
,
and
phosphate
esters
Anion
ic
surfactants
contain
anionic
functional
groups
at
their
head
,
such
as
sulfate
,
sulfonate
,
phosphate
,
and
carboxylate
s.
Prominent
alkyl
sulfates
include
ammonium
lauryl
sulfate
,
sodium
lauryl
sulfate
(
SDS
,
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
,
another
name
for
the
compound
)
and
the
related
alkyl-ether
sulfates
sodium
laureth
sulfate
,
also
known
as
sodium
lauryl
ether
sulfate
(
SLES
)
,
and
sodium
myreth
sulfate
.

Docusate
s
:
dioctyl
sodium
sulfosuccinate
,
perfluorooctanesulfonate
(
PFOS
)
,
perfluorobutanesulfonate
,
linear
alkylbenzene
sulfonate
s
(
LABs
)
.

These
include
alkyl-aryl
ether
phosphates
and
the
alkyl
ether
phosphate
CarboxylatesThese
are
the
most
common
surfactants
and
comprise
the
alkyl
carboxylates
(
soaps
)
,
such
as
sodium
stearate
.

More
specialized
species
include
sodium
lauroyl
sarcosinate
and
carboxylate-based
fluorosurfactants
such
as
perfluorononanoate
,
perfluorooctanoate
(
PFOA
or
PFO
)
.

Cationic
head
groups
Zwitterionic
surfactants
Zwitterion
ic
(
amphoteric
)
surfactants
have
both
cationic
and
anionic
centers
attached
to
the
same
molecule
.

The
cationic
part
is
based
on
primary
,
secondary
,
or
tertiary
amine
s
or
quaternary
ammonium
cations
.

The
anionic
part
can
be
more
variable
and
include
sulfonates
,
as
in
CHAPS
(
0
-
[
(
0-Cholamidopropyl
)
dimethylammonio
]
-0
-
propanesulfonate
)
.

Other
anionic
groups
are
sultaines
illustrated
by
cocamidopropyl
hydroxysultaine
.

Betaine
s
,
e.g.
,
cocamidopropyl
betaine
.

Phosphates

lecithin
Nonionic

Many
long
chain
alcohols
exhibit
some
surfactant
properties
.

Prominent
among
these
are
the
fatty
alcohol
s
cetyl
alcohol
,
stearyl
alcohol
,
and
cetostearyl
alcohol
(
consisting
predominantly
of
cetyl

Health
and
environmental
controversy
Surfactants
are
routinely
deposited
in
numerous
ways
on
land
and
into
water
systems
,
whether
as
part
of
an
intended
process
or
as
industrial
and
household
waste
.

Some
of
them
are
known
to
be
toxic
to
animals
,
ecosystems
,
and
humans
,
and
can
increase
the
diffusion
of
other
environmental
contaminants
.

As
a
result
,
there
are
proposed
or
voluntary
restrictions
on
the
use
of
some
surfactants
.

For
example
,
PFOS
is
a
persistent
organic
pollutant
as
judged
by
the
Stockholm
Convention
.

Additionally
,
PFOA
has
been
subject
to
a
voluntary
agreement
by
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
eight
chemical
companies
to
reduce
and
eliminate
emissions
of
the
chemical
and
its
precursors
.

The
two
major
surfactants
used
in
the
year
0000
were
linear
alkylbenzene
sulfonate
s
(
LAS
)
and
the
alkyl
phenol
ethoxylate
s
(
APE
)
.

They
break
down
in
the
conditions
found
in
sewage
treatment
plants
and
in
soil
.

Ordinary
dishwashing
detergent
,
for
example
,
will
promote
water
penetration
in
soil
,
but
the
effect
would
last
only
a
few
days
(
many
standard
laundry
detergent
powders
contain
levels
of
chemicals
such
as
alkali
and
chelating
agents
that
can
be
damaging
to
plants
and
should
not
be
applied
to
soils
)
.

Commercial
soil
wetting
agents
will
continue
to
work
for
a
considerable
period
,
but
they
will
eventually
be
degraded
by
soil
micro-organisms
.

Some
can
,
however
,
interfere
with
the
life-cycles
of
some
aquatic
organisms
,
so
care
should
be
taken
to
prevent
run-off
of
these
products
into
streams
,
and
excess
product
should
not
be
washed
down
.

Anionic
surfactants
can
be
found
in
soils
as
the
result
of
sludge
application
,
wastewater
irrigation
,
and
remediation
processes
.

Relatively
high
concentrations
of
surfactants
together
with
multimetals
can
represent
an
environmental
risk
.

At
low
concentrations
,
surfactant
application
is
unlikely
to
have
a
significant
effect
on
trace
metal
mobility
.

Biosurfactants
Biosurfactants
are
surface-active
substances
synthesised
by
living
cells
.

Interest
in
microbial
surfactants
has
been
steadily
increasing
in
recent
years
due
to
their
diversity
,
environmentally
friendly
nature
,
possibility
of
large-scale
production
,
selectivity
,
performance
under
extreme
conditions
,
and
potential
applications
in
environmental
protection
.

Biosurfactants
enhance
the
emulsification
of
hydrocarbons
,
have
the
potential
to
solubilise
hydrocarbon
contaminants
and
increase
their
availability
for
microbial
degradation
.

The
use
of
chemicals
for
the
treatment
of
a
hydrocarbon
polluted
site
may
contaminate
the
environment
with
their
by-products
,
whereas
biological
treatment
may
efficiently
destroy
pollutants
,
while
being
biodegradable
themselves
.

Hence
,
biosurfactant-producing
microorganisms
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
accelerated
bioremediation
of
hydrocarbon-contaminated
sites
.

These
compounds
can
also
be
used
in
enhanced
oil
recovery
and
may
be
considered
for
other
potential
applications
in
environmental
protection
.

Other
applications
include
herbicides
and
pesticides
formulations
,
detergents
,
healthcare
and
cosmetics
,
pulp
and
paper
,
coal
,
textiles
,
ceramic
processing
and
food
industries
,
uranium
ore-processing
,
and
mechanical
dewatering
of
peat
.

Several
microorganisms
are
known
to
synthesise
surface-active
agents
;
most
of
them
are
bacteria
and
yeasts
.

When
grown
on
hydrocarbon
substrate
as
the
carbon
source
,
these
microorganisms
synthesise
a
wide
range
of
chemicals
with
surface
activity
,
such
as
glycolipid
,
phospholipid
,
and
others
.

These
chemicals
are
synthesised
to
emulsify
the
hydrocarbon
substrate
and
facilitate
its
transport
into
the
cells
.

In
some
bacterial
species
such
as
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
,
biosurfactants
are
also
involved
in
a
group
motility
behavior
called
swarming
motility
.

Safety
and
environmental
risks
Most
anionic
and
nonionic
surfactants
are
nontoxic
,
having
LD00
comparable
to
sodium
chloride
.

The
situation
for
cationic
surfactants
is
more
diverse
.

Dialkyldimethylammonium
chlorides
have
very
low
LD00
's
(
0
g/kg
)
but
alkylbenzyldimethylammonium
chloride
has
an
LD00
of
0.00
g/kg
.

Prolonged
exposure
of
skin
to
surfactants
can
cause
chaffing
because
surfactants
(
e.g.
,
soap
)
disrupts
the
lipid
coating
that
protects
skin
(
and
other
)
cells
.

Biosurfactants
and
Deepwater
Horizon
The
use
of
biosurfactants
as
a
way
to
remove
petroleum
from
contaminated
sites
has
been
questioned
,
and
criticized
as
environmentally
unsafe
.

Biosurfactants
were
not
used
by
BP
after
the
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
.

However
,
unprecedented
amounts
of
Corexit
(
active
ingredient
:
Tween-00
)
,
were
sprayed
directly
into
the
ocean
at
the
leak
and
on
the
sea-water
's
surface
,
the
theory
being
that
the
surfactants
isolate
droplets
of
oil
,
making
it
easier
for
petroleum-consuming
microbes
to
digest
the
oil
.

Applications
Surfactants
play
an
important
role
as
cleaning
,
wetting
,
dispersing
,
emulsifying
,
foaming
and
anti-foaming
agents
in
many
practical
applications
and
products

History
Clark
,
Pennsylvania
used
to
be
called
Clarksville
back
in
the
late
0000s
.

Because
of
flooding
of
the
Shenango
River
a
dam
was
built
in
Sharpsville
,
Pennsylvania
and
the
borough
of
Clarksville
was
moved
to
higher
ground
that
was
farmland
and
forest
.

Houses
were
moved
as
well
as
a
cemetery
.

Other
houses
that
were
not
moved
were
used
by
the
workers
of
the
reservoir
.

They
were
then
demolished
.

The
Erie
Canal
extension
went
along
this
Shenango
River
route
and
is
now
under
water
.

Clarksville
had
quite
a
history
at
one
time
with
the
Erie
Canal
coming
through
it
.

The
old
town
is
now
covered
by
water
,
grass
,
trees
and
weeds
.

The
only
remains
of
it
are
some
old
asphalt
streets
that
can
be
found
amongst
the
trees
,
along
with
the
main
road
,
which
is
visible
when
the
water
is
lowered
.

There
is
now
a
marina
there
that
sits
where
businesses
and
residents
used
to
be
.

Farrell
is
a
city
in
Mercer
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Youngstown
–
Warren
–
Boardman
,
OH
-
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Once
dubbed
"
The
Magic
City
,
"
Farrell
sprung
up
practically
overnight
when
a
steel
mill
was
constructed
in
0000
on
a
plain
bordering
the
Shenango
River
in
what
was
then
part
of
Hickory
Township
(
now
Hermitage
)
.

The
community
was
incorporated
as
the
Borough
of
South
Sharon
in
0000
;
its
population
peaked
at
over
00,000
in
0000
and
its
status
was
elevated
to
a
third-class
city
in
0000
.

At
that
time
the
residents
of
the
new
city
elected
to
take
the
name
of
Farrell
,
after
industrialist
James
A.
Farrell
.

The
mill
,
which
eventually
became
known
as
the
Roemer
Works
of
Sharon
Steel
Corporation
,
would
serve
as
the
community
's
lifeblood
until
0000
,
when
it
was
liquidated
after
filing
bankruptcy
.

Many
of
the
assets
were
sold
at
auction
to
Britain-based
Caparo
Corp.
and
later
to
Swiss
steelmaker
Duferco
,
which
operates
the
plant
today
.

Farrell
was
designated
a
financially
distressed
municipality
in
0000
by
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
.

Despite
years
of
population
and
industrial
decline
,
Farrell
has
made
progress
in
rebuilding
itself
due
to
new
industrial
investments
on
tax
abated
land
and
several
new
housing
starts
.

These
Days
is
Bon
Jovi
's
sixth
studio
album
,
released
on
June
00
,
0000
.

This
was
the
first
album
Bon
Jovi
released
after
the
dismissal
of
bassist
Alec
John
Such
.

Hugh
McDonald
unofficially
replaced
Such
as
bassist
.

The
album
,
produced
by
Peter
Collins
,
Richie
Sambora
and
Jon
Bon
Jovi
,
was
an
overall
darker
album
in
contrast
to
the
band
's
usual
brand
of
feel-good
,
inspiring
rock
songs
and
love
ballads
.

At
the
time
of
release
,
the
album
was
a
huge
commercial
hit
,
particularly
in
Europe
and
Japan
.

In
Japan
,
the
album
debuted
at
number
one
on
the
Oricon
chart
with
sales
of
000,000
,
becoming
the
fastest
selling
album
by
a
non-Japanese
act
in
history
of
the
country
's
chart
.

In
the
UK
,
These
Days
replaced
Michael
Jackson
's
album
HIStory
at
number
one
on
the
UK
Albums
Chart
and
spent
four
consecutive
weeks
at
#
0
.

The
album
spawned
four
Top
00
singles
on
the
UK
Singles
Chart
,
the
band
's
highest
number
of
Top
00
singles
from
one
album
in
UK
.

The
album
also
topped
Billboard
European
Albums
Chart
for
seven
weeks
and
certified
triple
platinum
by
the
International
Federation
of
the
Phonographic
Industry
for
selling
0
million
copies
across
Europe
.

The
album
was
ranked
number
two
on
Q
magazine
's
list
of
the
"
Top
00
albums
of
0000
"
.

In
0000
,
the
album
featured
in
the
Classic
Rock
&
Metal
Hammer
's
The
"
000
Greatest
Albums
Of
The
00
's
"
.

In
the
U.S.
,
despite
selling
0
million
copies
and
certified
platinum
by
the
Recording
Industry
Association
of
America
(
RIAA
)
,
the
album
was
n't
as
successful
as
it
was
overseas
.

The
album
peaked
at
number
nine
on
the
Billboard
000
.

The
high
sales
of
the
album
in
Europe
warranted
a
re-issue
of
the
album
under
the
name
of
These
Days
Special
Edition
a
year
after
its
original
release
.

Background
When
the
Keep
the
Faith
Tour
ended
in
December
0000
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
went
on
a
vacation
in
January
0000
where
he
wrote
"
Something
To
Believe
In
"
,
really
the
first
song
written
for
the
album
.

Over
the
next
nine
months
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
wrote
and
demoed
forty
songs
.

The
album
was
originally
slated
to
be
released
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
0000
,
but
they
asked
for
more
time
because
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
felt
that
they
were
really
creative
on
writing
.

Because
of
that
,
they
released
Cross
Road
,
their
first
greatest
hits
album
with
two
new
songs
in
October
0000
.

Recording
and
production
Jon
Bon
Jovi
hired
Peter
Collins
to
produce
the
album
,
based
on
his
prior
work
with
several
acts
such
as
Rush
,
Queensrÿche
and
Alice
Cooper
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
were
also
co-producers
of
the
album
.

They
planned
to
record
the
album
in
Nashville
in
the
fall
of
0000
.

After
a
one
week
to
ten
days
of
recording
during
October
0000
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
erased
it
all
.

Next
four
months
recording
shifted
between
Jon
Bon
Jovi
’s
home
studio
Sanctuary
I
,
Woodstock
,
NY
and
three
separate
studios
in
Los
Angeles
,
One
On
One
Studios
,
Ocean
Way
Recording
and
A&M
Studios
.

The
reason
for
the
numerous
studios
was
for
a
variety
of
reasons
;
the
band
embarked
on
a
mini
Christmas
tour
of
clubs
in
December
0000
,
they
were
continuing
to
promote
Cross
Road
and
Richie
Sambora
’s
marriage
to
Heather
Locklear
.

All
the
basic
tracks
except
for
"
Diamond
Ring
"
and
"
(
It
's
Hard
)
Letting
You
Go
"
were
recorded
in
Woodstock
,
NY
.

All
the
rhythm
guitar
parts
were
recorded
in
Los
Angeles
and
all
the
keyboards
were
recorded
in
New
Jersey
.

Most
vocals
were
done
in
New
Jersey
.

Very
little
was
done
in
Nashville
finally
made
it
,
one
vocal
and
one
or
two
keyboard
parts
.
"

Diamond
Ring
"
and
"
(
It
's
Hard
)
Letting
You
Go
"
recut
in
Los
Angeles
.

The
album
mixed
by
Bob
Clearmountain
in
Los
Angeles
.

Composition
Music
Jon
Bon
Jovi
is
credited
with
composing
the
music
for
all
of
the
album
's
tracks
.

Richie
Sambora
is
also
credited
with
composing
the
music
for
all
of
the
album
's
tracks
,
except
"
(
It
's
Hard
)
Letting
You
Go
"
,
"
Something
To
Believe
In
"
,
both
was
written
and
composed
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
.

And
he
is
not
credited
on
"
Hearts
Breaking
Even
"
,
which
was
written
and
composed
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Desmond
Child
.

Desmond
Child
is
also
credited
with
composing
"
Something
For
The
Pain
"
,
"
This
Ai
n't
A
Love
Song
"
and
"
Diamond
Ring
"
.

All
of
the
other
tracks
were
written
and
composed
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
.

Despite
the
influences
the
band
infused
on
this
record
,
soul
,
R&B
,
blues
0000s
and
0000s
rock
,
the
band
and
producer
Peter
Collins
find
a
balance
which
sound
definitively
Bon
Jovi
.

The
inspiration
for
"
Something
For
The
Pain
"
was
T.
Rex
and
old
early
0000s
stuff
.

As
for
musical
inspiration
for
"
This
Ai
n't
A
Love
Song
"
and
"
Hearts
Breaking
Even
"
are
more
of
old
soul
music
and
R&B
.
"

Damned
"
is
the
one
of
Jon
Bon
Jovi
's
favorite
track
on
the
album
.

As
he
said
"
it
has
the
Asbury
Jukes
horns
,
which
is
a
big
thrill
for
me
.

I
only
ever
wanted
to
be
a
juke
"
.

Lyrics
Jon
Bon
Jovi
stated
that
even
though
the
album
was
their
darkest
,
the
band
was
in
a
very
happy
place
at
the
time
.
"

Hey
God
"
is
written
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
in
Jon
Bon
Jovi
's
basement
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
was
inspired
by
the
view
out
of
the
window
from
00th
St.
and
Broadway
in
New
York
,
a
guy
with
an
Armani
suit
on
next
to
a
guys
that
's
sleeping
on
the
street
.
"

Something
For
The
Pain
"
was
the
most
difficult
to
write
,
says
Jon
Bon
Jovi
.

They
kept
rewriting
until
the
chorus
to
make
it
make
sense
.
"

My
Guitar
Lies
Bleeding
In
My
Arms
"
was
written
from
a
writing
session
where
they
were
hit
with
writer
’s
block
.

Taking
a
cue
from
the
opening
line
of
"
Bed
of
Roses
"
(
"
Sitting
here
wasted
and
wounded
at
this
old
piano
,
Trying
hard
to
capture
the
moment
"
)
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
instead
of
putting
the
pen
down
,
wrote
about
his
experience
and
out
of
it
is
one
of
the
band
’s
most
ingenious
compositions
.
"

Damned
"
is
about
a
guy
who
involved
with
a
married
woman
.
"

(
It
's
Hard
)
Letting
You
Go
"
was
written
by
Jon
Bon
Jovi
for
the
movie
called
Moonlight
and
Valentino
in
which
he
appeared
.
"

Something
To
Believe
In
"
is
an
introspective
song
about
a
guy
questioning
everything
around
him
.

Richie
Sambora
’s
"
Hey
,
hey
,
hey
"
chant
on
the
song
is
lifted
from
the
demo
.

It
was
spot-on
they
kept
it
and
used
it
on
the
record
.
"

Diamond
Ring
"
was
originally
written
for
the
album
New
Jersey
in
0000
,
but
never
made
it
on
the
any
previous
Bon
Jovi
records
.

Release
and
reception
Two
titles
that
were
considered
were
"
Open
All
Night
"
and
"
Strip
"
but
ultimately
,
the
band
wanted
to
make
a
statement
about
the
themes
of
the
record
.

Mark
Selliger
shot
the
album
cover
in
Mexico
.

Jon
Bon
Jovi
said
that
"
we
tried
to
get
crazy
exotic
but
it
did
n't
come
out
great
.

We
also
shooting
in
LA
and
Bombay
we
finally
settled
on
a
picture
"
.

The
two
extra
songs
"
All
I
Want
Is
Everything
"
and
"
Bitter
Wine
"
appear
as
bonus
tracks
on
the
international
versions
.

Released
June
00
in
Japan
,
June
00
in
Europe
and
June
00
in
the
rest
of
the
world
,
the
album
was
an
immediate
success
.

It
even
replaced
Michael
Jackson
’s
HIStory
in
the
UK
,
debuting
at
number
one
,
spending
four
weeks
at
number
one
.

These
Days
also
topped
the
charts
in
several
other
European
countries
,
including
Germany
,
Austria
,
Switzerland
,
the
Netherlands
,
Ireland
,
Finland
,
and
Portugal
and
spending
seven
weeks
on
Billboard
European
Albums
Chart
.

It
was
certified
triple
platinum
by
the
International
Federation
of
the
Phonographic
Industry
for
selling
0
million
copies
across
Europe
.

In
Australia
,
it
debuted
at
number
one
and
spent
two
weeks
at
number
one
on
the
ARIA
Charts
.

The
album
became
Bon
Jovi
's
second
number
one
album
in
Japan
,
where
it
debuted
at
number
one
on
the
Oricon
chart
,
selling
over
000,000
copies
in
its
first
week
and
becoming
the
fastest
selling
album
by
a
non-Japanese
act
in
history
of
the
country
's
chart
.

The
album
has
sold
more
than
0
million
copies
and
certified
five
times
platinum
and
became
the
band
's
best
selling
studio
album
in
Japan
.

These
Days
received
favorable
reviews
from
critics
.

Q
magazine
,
in
a
four
star
review
,
said
that
"
Cross
Road
"
and
"
Always
"
confirmed
that
Bon
Jovi
would
survive
grunge
and
These
Days
consolidated
their
status
by
cowboy
booting
Michael
Jackson
's
HIStory
album
off
the
UK
number
0
album
slot
.

The
review
said
that
"
Hey
God
"
,
"
Lie
to
Me
"
and
"
Something
to
Believe
In
"
were
singled
out
as
the
albums
highlights
and
the
album
was
arguably
the
band
's
finest
musical
hour
to
date
.

Stephen
Thomas
Erlewine
of
Allmusic
concluded
that
"
as
the
years
go
by
,
Bon
Jovi
gets
musically
stronger
.

Not
only
are
their
best
songs
stronger
now
,
their
playing
is
more
accomplished
.

Keeping
these
improvements
in
mind
,
it
's
no
surprise
that
the
group
was
one
of
the
few
pop-metal
bands
to
sustain
a
career
in
the
mid
-
'00s
"
.

In
the
UK
,
the
album
was
particularly
notable
for
producing
four
Top
00
hit
singles
but
failed
to
impress
the
audience
and
the
critics
in
the
United
States
.

The
album
peaked
at
number
nine
on
the
Billboard
000
.

Entertainment
Weekly
said
"
the
group
happily
forsakes
conventional
corporate
rock
for
a
loud
kind
of
adult
pop
.

Think
Whitney
Houston
with
guitars
"

The
album
was

platinum
in

fans
.

"
released
a
year
later
with
the
live
album

Wild

Live
0000
–
0000
.
"

It
's
My
Life
"

band
's
most
well-known
songs
,
and
one
of
their
most
successful
singles
,
reaching
number
one
in
several
countries
and
becoming
the
third
best
selling
single
of
0000
.

Background
After
a
five
year
hiatus
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
and
Richie
Sambora
both
released
solo
albums
.

In
0000
,
Jon
Bon
Jovi
was
planning
to
release
his
third
solo
album
but
the
band
started
to
work
on
their
new
album
in
summer
of
0000
.

The
working
title
of
the
album
was
"
Sex
Sells
"
.

Posters
of
this
album
are
seen
advertised
in
and
around
New
York
in
the
"
Real
Life
"
music
video
.

Another
working
title
was
"
One
Wild
Night
"
.

The
name
was
dropped
but
later
used
for
the
live
compilation
album
the
following
year
.

After
the
initial
plan
to
team
up
hard-rock
producers
Bob
Rock
and
Bruce
Fairbairn
fell
through
because
of
the
latter
's
death
,
an
audition
process
was
set
up
,
but
the
band
was
uninterested
by
the
top
producers
interviewed
.

Eventually
Bon
Jovi
asked
A&R
executive
John
Kalodner
if
he
knew
up-and-coming
producers
,
and
he
recommended
Luke
Ebbin
.

Ebbin
was
brought
to
Bon
Jovi
's
home
studio
in
New
Jersey
,
and
took
a
demo
with
only
vocals
and
acoustic
guitar
to
add
programming
,
string
and
background
vocal
arrangements
"
so
I
could
show
him
some
of
my
abilities
.
"

Upon
his
return
,
Ebbin
was
hired
.

The
choice
was
a
fortuitous
one
as
it
allowed
Bon
Jovi
to
update
their
sound
with
a
smattering
of
loops
and
impressive
arrangements
.

well
received
by

,
it
was
the
first
Bon
Jovi
album
ever
to
be
nominated
for
a
Grammy
.

In
a
review
for
Allmusic
,
Steve
Huey
expressed
the
opinion
that
Crush
was
a
"
solidly
crafted
mainstream
rock
record
that
's
much
better
than
most
might
expect
.
"

Rolling
Stone
gave
the
album
0
stars
out
of
0
and
described
"
It
's
My
Life
"
as
"
a
Britney
track
shot
through
the
heart
with
Richie
Sambora
's
voice-box
guitar
.
"

Entertainment
Weekly
gave
it
a
B
and
said
that
"
if
the
Jersey
rockers
have
n't
matured
much
,
it
hardly
matters
.

Crush
—
for
all
its
sappy
ballads
and
suburban
pop
fairy
tales
—
is
classic
Bon
Jovi
.

And
that
's
not
an
oxymoron

Mandamus
is
a
judicial
remedy
—
in
the
form
of
an
order
from
a
superior
court
,
to
any
government
subordinate
court
,
corporation
,
or
public
authority
—
to
do
(
or
forbear
from
doing
)
some
specific
act
which
that
body
is
obliged
under
law
to
do
(
or
refrain
from
doing
)
—
and
which
is
in
the
nature
of
public
duty
,
and
in
certain
cases
one
of
a
statutory
duty
.

It
can
not
be
issued
to
compel
an
authority
to
do
something
against
statutory
provision
.

For
example
,
it
can
not
be
used
to
force
a
lower
court
to
reject
or
authorize
applications
that
have
been
made
,
but
if
the
court
refuses
to
rule
one
way
or
the
other
then
a
mandamus
can
be
used
to
order
the
court
to
rule
on
the
applications
.

Mandamus
may
be
a
command
to
do
an
administrative
action
or
not
to
take
a
particular
action
,
and
it
is
supplemented
by
legal
right
s.
In
the
American
legal
system
it
must
be
a
judicially
enforceable
and
legally
protected
right
before
one
suffering
a
grievance
can
ask
for
a
mandamus
.

A
person
can
be
said
to
be
aggrieved
only
when
he
is
denied
a
legal
right
by
someone
who
has
a
legal
duty
to
do
something
and
abstains
from
doing
it
.

Legal
requirements
The
applicant
pleading
for
the
writ
of
mandamus
to
be
enforced
should
be
able
to
show
that
he
or
she
has
a
legal
right
to
compel
the
respondent
to
do
or
refrain
from
doing
the
specific
act
.

The
duty
sought
to
be
enforced
must
have
two
qualities
:
It
must
be
a
duty
of
public
nature
and
the
duty
must
be
imperative
and
should
not
be
.

Furthermore
,
mandamus
will
typically
not
be
granted
if
adequate
relief
can
be
obtained
by
some
other
means
,
such
as
appeal
.

Purpose
The
purpose
of
mandamus
is
to
remedy
defects
of
justice
.

It
lies
in
the
cases
where
there
is
a
specific
right
but
no
specific
legal
remedy
for
enforcing
that
right
.

Generally
,
it
is
not
available
in
anticipation
of
any
injury
except
when
the
petitioner
is
likely
to
be
affected
by
an
official
act
in
contravention
of
a
statutory
duty
or
where
an
illegal
or
unconstitutional
order
is
made
.

The
grant
of
mandamus
is
therefore
an
equitable
remedy
;
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
court
,
the
exercise
of
which
is
governed
by
well-settled
principles
.

Mandamus
,
being
a
discretionary
remedy
,
the
application
for
that
must
be
made
in
good
faith
and
not
for
indirect
purposes
.

Acquiescence
can
not
,
however
,
bar
the
issue
of
mandamus
.

The
petitioner
must
,
of
course
,
satisfy
the
Court
that
he
has
the
legal
right
to
the
performance
of
the
legal
duty
as
distinct
from
mere
discretion
of
authority
.

A
mandamus
is
normally
issued
when
an
officer
or
an
authority
by
compulsion
of
statute
is
required
to
perform
a
duty
and
which
despite
demand
in
writing
has
not
been
performed
.

In
no
other
case
will
a
writ
of
mandamus
issue
unless
it
be
to
quash
an
illegal
order
.

Types
There
are
three
kinds
of
mandamus
:
In
various
countries
Parliamentary
democracies
Under
the
Australian
legal
system
,
mandamus
is
available
through
section
00
(
v
)
of
the
Australian
Constitution
.

In
England
and
Wales
,
mandamus
was
originally
known
as
a
writ
of
mandamus
and
more
recently
as
an
order
of
mandamus
.

This
procedure
was
renamed
by
the
Civil
Procedure
(
Modification
of
Supreme
Court
Act
0000
)
Order
0000
to
become
a
mandatory
order
.

In
India
,
the
sine
qua
non
for
mandamus
is
the
existence
of
a
statutory
public
duty
incumbent
upon
the
person
or
body
against
whom
the
mandamus
is
sought
.

There
must
equally
co-exist
a
corresponding
right
in
the
petitioner
entitling
him
to
claim
the
enforcement
of
such
public
duty
.

These
two
preconditions
form
the
foundation
for
the
issue
of
mandamus
.

The
primary
scope
and
function
of
mandamus
is
to
"
command
"
and
"
execute
"
rather
than
to
"
enquire
"
and
"
adjudicate
"
.

It
can
not
be
issued
to
change
the
decision
of
a

United
States
In
the
administrative
law
context
in
the
United
States
,
the
requirement
that
mandamus
can
be
used
only
to
compel
a
ministerial
act
has
largely
been
abandoned
.

By
statute
or
by
judicial
expansion
of
the
writ
of
mandamus
in
most
of
the
U.S.
state
s
,
acts
of
administrative
agencies
are
now
subject
to
judicial
review
for
abuse
of
discretion
.

Judicial
review
of
agencies
of
the
United
States
federal
government
,
for
abuse
of
discretion
,
is
authorized
by
the
U.S.
Administrative
Procedures
Act
.

Federal
courtsIn
modern
practice
,
the
Court
has
effectively
abolished
the
issuance
of
writs
of
mandamus
,
although
it
theoretically
retains
the
power
to
issue
them
.

In
the
context
of
mandamus
from
a
United
States
Court
of
Appeals
to
a
United
States
District
Court
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
ruled
that
the
appellate
courts
have
discretion
to
issue
mandamus
to
control
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
lower
court
in
unusual
circumstances
,
where
there
is
a
compelling
reason
not
to
wait
for
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
.

This
discretion
is
exercised
very
sparingly
.

It
is
exercised
with
somewhat
greater
frequency
,
although
still
sparingly
,
in
the
context
of
discovery
disputes
involving
privileged
materials
,
since
a
district
court
order
erroneously
forcing
the
disclosure
of
privileged
material
may
never
be
remediable
through
a
later
appeal
.

The
authority
of
the
United
States
district
court
s
to
issue
mandamus
has
been
expressly
abrogated
by
Rule
00
(
b
)
of
the
Federal
Rules
of
Civil
Procedure
,
but
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
can
be
had
by
other
remedies
provided
for
in
the
Rules
,
where
provided
by
statute
,
or
by
use
of
the
District
Court
's
equitable
powers
.

State
courtsIn
some
state
court
systems
,
mandamus
has
evolved
into
a
general
procedure
for
discretionary
appeals
from
non-final
trial
court
decisions
.

In
some
U.S.
state
s
,
such
as
California
,
the
writ
is
now
called
mandate
instead
of
mandamus
,
and
may
be
issued
by
any
level
of
the
state
court
system
to
any
lower
court
or
to
any
government
official
.

It
is
still
common
for
Californians
to
bring
"
taxpayer
actions
"
against
public
officials
for
wasting
public
funds
through
mismanagement
of
a
government
agency
,
where
the
relief
sought
is
a
writ
of
mandate
compelling
the
official
to
stop
wasting
money
and
fulfill
his
duty
to
protect
the
public
fisc
.

The
writ
of
mandate
is
also
used
in
California
for
interlocutory
appeal
s.
In
this
context
,
the
party
seeking
the
writ
is
treated
on
appeal
like
a
plaintiff
,
the
trial
court
becomes
the
defendant
,
and
the
opponent
is
designated
as
the
"
real
party
in
interest
.
"

In
Virginia
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
"
original
jurisdiction
"
under
the
state
constitution
for
mandamus
involving
the
Virginia
courts
.

Other
states
,
including
New
York
,
have
replaced
mandamus
(
as
well
as
the
other
prerogative
writs
)
with
statutory
procedures
.

In
New
York
,
this
is
known
as
an
Article
00
review
after
the
civil
procedure
law
provision
that
created
the
relevant
procedure
.

In
still
other
states
,
such
as
Illinois
,
the
state
court
of
last
resort
has
original
jurisdiction
in
mandamus
actions
.

The
Spanish
conquest
of
Yucatán
was
the
campaign
undertaken
by
the
Spanish
conquistador
es
against
the
Late
Postclassic
Maya
states
and
polities
,
particularly
in
the
northern
and
central
Yucatán
Peninsula
but
also
involving
the
Maya
polities
of
the
Guatemala
n
highlands
region
.

This
episode
in
the
conquest
and
colonization
of
the
Americas
began
in
the
early
00th
century
,
but
was
a
more
difficult
and
lengthier
exercise
in
subjugation
than
the
equivalent
campaigns
against
the
Aztec
Triple
Alliance
and
the
Inca
Empire
.

It
would
take
some
000
years
and
the
help
of
the
Xiu
Maya
before
the
last
recognized
Maya
stronghold
fell
,
that
of
the
Itza
capital
of
Tayasal
on
Lake
Petén
Itzá
,
in
0000
.

Following
the
great
revolt
of
the
seven
Mayan
provinces
to
the
east
,
the
authorisation
of
the
Indian
auxiliaries
to
enslave
any
Mayan
rebels
they
managed
to
catch
helped
quell
the
resistance
.

Except
for
the
Petén
region
and
the
Guatemalan
highlands
,
Spanish
control
over
Yucatán
itself
was
effectively
in
place
by
0000
even
though
as
late
as
0000
,
there
were
only
some
0,000
Spanish
in
all
of
the
colonial
provinces
.

Unlike
the
campaigns
against
the
Aztec
and
Inca
states
,
the
Maya
had
no
single
political
center
whose
overthrow
would
hasten
the
end
of
collective
resistance
by
the
indigenous
peoples
.

Instead
,
the
Maya
were
organized
into
a
number
of
independent
states
,
which
the
conquistador
forces
needed
to
subdue
almost
one
by
one
,
and
many
of
these
fiercely
resisted
the
Spanish
incursions
.

Particularly
in
the
early
stages
,
a
prime
motivating
factor
for
the
conquistadores
was
their
interest
in
seizing
great
quantities
of
precious
metals
,
such
as
gold
and
silver
.

Since
the
Maya
lands
were
poor
in
these
resources
,
they
held
comparatively
little
initial
interest
for
the
Spanish
,
who
were
attracted
instead
to
central
Mexico
and
Peru
by
promising
reports
of
the
greater
rewards
on
offer
there
.

However
,
with
the
prospects
of
new
land
grants
and
the
acquisition
of
labour
forces
,
it
was
not
long
until
Spanish
intentions
turned
to
the
Maya
region
,
with
the
first
concerted
efforts
to
establish
a
presence
commencing
from
the
0000s
.

After
Spanish
dominion
over
the
region
was
finally
established
,
the
Maya
peoples
themselves
remained
restive
against
Spanish
rule
,
both
under
the
colonial
phase
of
New
Spain
and
then
under
the
newly-independent
Mexican
state
.

Maya
discontent
in
Yucatán
would
later
erupt
into
open
revolt
in
the
mid
00th
century
,
in
the
Caste
War
of
Yucatán
.

The
major
portion
of
this
conflict
lasted
over
fifty
years
,
during
which
much
of
the
southeastern
portion
of
the
Peninsula
was
an
effectively
independent
Maya
state
,
Chan
Santa
Cruz
.

Complete
suppression
of
the
revolt
was
difficult
to
obtain
,
and
skirmishes
continued
up
into
the
0000s
(
Rugeley
0000
)
.

First
encounters
(
0000
)
The
first
known
Spanish
landing
on
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
was
a
product
of
misfortune
,
when
in
0000
a
small
vessel
bound
for
the
island
of
Santo
Domingo
from
Darién
,
Panama
ran
aground
on
some
shoals
in
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
south
of
the
island
of
Jamaica
.

The
ship
's
complement
of
fifteen
men
and
two
women
set
off
in
the
ship
's
boat
in
an
attempt
to
reach
Cuba
or
one
of
the
other
colonies
.

However
,
the
prevailing
currents
forced
them
westwards
until
,
after
approximately
two
weeks
of
drifting
,
they
reached
the
eastern
shoreline
of
the
Peninsula
,
possibly
in
present-day
Belize
.

Captured
by
the
local
Maya
,
they
were
divided
up
among
several
of
the
chieftains
as
slaves
and
a
number
were
sacrificed
and
killed
according
to
offeratory
practices
.

Over
the
succeeding
years
their
numbers
dwindled
further
as
others
were
lost
to
disease
or
exhaustion
,
until
only
two
were
left
–
Gerónimo
de
Aguilar
who
had
escaped
his
former
captor
and
found
refuge
with
another
Maya
ruler
,
and
Gonzalo
Guerrero
who
had
won
some
prestige
among
the
Maya
for
his
bravery
and
had
now
the
standing
of
a
ranking
warrior
and
noble
.

These
two
would
later
have
notable
,
but
very
different
,
roles
to
play
in
future
conflicts
between
the
Spanish
and
the
Mesoamerican
peoples
–
Aguilar
would
become
Cortés
's
translator
and
advisor
,
with
Guerrero
instead
electing
to
remain
with
the
Maya
and
served
as
a
tactician
and
warrior
fighting
with
them
against
the
Spanish
.

Early
expeditions
(
0000
–
00
)
The
next
contact
was
in
0000
when
Francisco
Hernández
de
Córdoba
sailed
from
Cuba
in
search
of
slaves
to
replace
the
native
Cubans
who
had
been
dying
off
in
great
numbers
.

The
Spaniards
were
surprised
to
see
stone
cities
along
the
coast
of
Yucatán
.

Córdoba
landed
at
several
towns
;
some
greeted
the
Spanish
with
friendship
and
offered
to
trade
goods
with
them
(
the
Spaniards
acquired
a
few
pieces
of
gold
ornaments
this
way
)
.

The
mauling
at
Cape
Cotoche
climaxed
when
the
explorers
landed
at
'
the
Coast
of
the
Disastrous
Battle
.
'

To
Córboda
and
his
men
,
it
was
an
ambush
with
some
00
Spaniards
being
wounded
by
the
first
volley
of
stones
,
arrows
,
and
darts
.

The
Spanish
soon
learned
that
the
Mayan
arrows
,
while
not
attaining
any
distinct
force
behind
them
,
tended
to
shatter
on
impact
leading
to
a
slow
and
painful
death
.

Despite
these
shortcomings
,
the
failed
attempts
to
gather
water
and
repair
the
casks
that
were
issued
ultimately
caused
Córdoba
to
distribute
his
remaining
sailors
and
abandon
his
smallest
ship
,
a
brigantine
paid
for
on
credit
.

The
expedition
returned
to
Cuba
to
report
on
the
discovery
of
this
new
land
.

Diego
Velázquez
,
the
governor
of
Cuba
,
ordered
an
expedition
sent
out
with
four
ships
supplied
with
crossbows
,
muskets
,
salt
pork
,
and
cassava
bread
for
some
000
men
led
by
his
nephew
,
Juan
de
Grijalva
.

The
Grijalva
expedition
had
similar
,
mixed
experiences
with
the
native
Maya
and
seemed
genuinely
anxious
to
fulfil
Velázquez
'
order
to
explore
rather
than
settle
.

He
repeatedly
refused
the
gratification
of
vengeance
as
they
sailed
along
the
coasts
of
Yucatán
for
months
.

Except
for
a
few
cannon
shots
,
the
desire
to
exchange
beads
and
Spanish
wine
for
food
and
other
necessities
were
left
in
readiness
.

He
was
disappointed
at
gathering
very
little
gold
,
but
came
back
to
Cuba
with
a
tale
that
a
rich
empire
was
further
to
the
west
.

This
prompted
the
Hernán
Cortés
expedition
in
0000
.

Cortés
spent
some
time
at
the
island
of
Cozumel
,
tried
with
mixed
results
to
convert
the
locals
to
Christianity
,
and
heard
stories
of
other
bearded
white
men
living
in
the
area
.

He
sent
messengers
to
these
reported
castilianos
,
who
turned
out
to
be
the
survivors
of
the
0000
shipwreck
,
Aguilar
and
Guerrero
.

Aguilar
petitioned
his
Maya
chieftain
to
be
allowed
leave
to
join
with
his
former
countrymen
,
and
he
was
released
and
made
his
way
to
Cortés
'
ships
.

According
to
Bernal
Díaz
,
Aguilar
said
that
before
coming
he
had
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
convince
Guerrero
to
leave
as
well
.

Guerrero
declined
on
the
basis
that
he
was
by
now
well-assimilated
with
the
Maya
culture
,
had
a
Maya
wife
and
three
children
,
and
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
figure
of
rank
within
the
Maya
settlement
of
Chetumal
where
he
lived
.

Aguilar
,
now
quite
fluent
in
Yucatec
Maya
as
well
as
some
other
indigenous
languages
,
would
prove
to
be
a
valuable
asset
for
Cortés
as
a
translator
,
a
skill
of
particular
significance
to
the
later
conquest
of
the
Aztec
Triple
Alliance
which
would
be
the
end
result
of
Cortés
'
expedition
.

Although
Guerrero
's
later
fate
is
uncertain
,
it
appears
that
for
some
years
he
continued
to
fight
alongside
the
Maya
forces
against
Spanish
incursions
,
providing
military
counsel
and
encouraging
resistance
;
he
quite
possibly
was
killed
in
a
later
battle
.

First
attempted
conquest
(
0000
–
00
)
The
richer
lands
of
Mexico
engaged
the
main
attention
of
the
Conquistadors
for
some
years
,
then
in
0000
Francisco
de
Montejo
(
a
veteran
of
the
Grijalva
and
Cortés
expeditions
)
successfully
petitioned
the
King
of
Spain
for
the
right
to
conquer
Yucatán
.

He
arrived
in
eastern
Yucatán
in
0000
and
at
first
was
greeted
peaceably
,
and
most
local
chiefs
agreed
with
his
demand
that
they
swear
loyalty
to
the
King
of
Spain
,
for
they
had
heard
news
of
the
Spanish
conquest
of
the
Aztecs
.

However
,
as
the
Spanish
advanced
they
found
towns
already
deserted
when
they
reached
them
,
and
the
Spanish
were
first
harried
as
they
traveled
and
then
openly
attacked
.

The
Spanish
set
up
a
small
fort
on
the
coast
at
Xamanha
in
0000
,
but
had
no
further
success
in
subduing
the
country
.

Montejo
went
to
Mexico
to
gather
a
larger
army
.

Second
attempted
conquest
(
0000
–
00
)
Montejo
returned
in
0000
with
a
force
that
allied
with
the
Maya
port
city
of
Campeche
.

While
he
set
up
a
fortress
at
Campeche
,
he
sent
his
son
Francisco
Montejo
the
Younger
inland
with
an
army
.

The
leaders
of
some
Maya
states
pledged
that
they
would
be
his
allies
.

He
continued
on
to
Chichen
Itza
,
which
he
declared
his
Royal
capital
of
Spanish
Yucatán
,
but
after
a
few
months
the
locals
rose
up
against
him
,
the
Spaniards
were
constantly
attacked
,
and
the
Spanish
force
fled
to
Honduras
.

It
was
rumored
that
Gonzalo
Guerrero
,
a
Spaniard
shipwrecked
in
0000
who
chose
to
stay
in
Yucatán
,
was
among
those
directing
Maya
resistance
to
the
Spanish
crown
.

Meanwhile
the
elder
Montejo
was
frequently
besieged
in
his
fort
in
Campeche
,
and
many
of
his
soldiers
were
tired
of
a
long
fight
with
little
to
show
for
it
,
and
stated
that
they
wished
to
find
easier
conquests
elsewhere
.

In
0000
,
Montejo
withdrew
his
forces
to
Veracruz
,
leaving
the
Yucatán
once
again
completely
in
the
control
of
the
Maya
.

Final
conquests
(
0000
–
00
)
Montejo
the
Elder
,
who
was
now
in
his
late
00s
,
turned
his
royal
rights
in
Yucatán
over
to
his
son
,
Francisco
Montejo
the
Younger
.

The
younger
Montejo
invaded
Yucatán
with
a
large
force
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
he
set
up
his
capital
in
the
Maya
city
of
T'ho
,
which
he
renamed
Mérida
.

The
lord
of
the
Tutal
Xiu
of
Maní
converted
to
Christianity
.

The
Xiu
dominated
most
of
Western
Yucatán
and
became
valuable
allies
of
the
Spanish
,
greatly
assisting
in
the
conquest
of
the
rest
of
the
peninsula
.

A
number
of
Maya
states
at
first
pledged
loyalty
to
Spain
,
but
revolted
after
feeling
the
heavy
hand
of
Spanish
rule
.

Fighting
and
revolts
continued
for
years
.

When
the
Spanish
and
Xiu
defeated
an
army
of
the
combined
forces
of
the
states
of
Eastern
Yucatán
in
0000
,
the
conquest
was
officially
complete
;
however
,
periodic
revolts
,
which
would
be
violently
put
down
by
Spanish
troops
and
Indian
auxiliaries
,
continued
throughout
the
Spanish
colonial
era
.

The
Itza
of
Petén
The
Postclassic
Itza
Maya
of
the
Petén
Basin
region
should
be
mentioned
;
while
that
area
is
now
part
of
Guatemala
,
in
colonial
times
it
was
part
of
the
land
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Governor
of
Yucatán
.

The
Itza
capital
was
in
Tayasal
,
an
island
city
in
lake
Petén
Itza
.

The
Itza
land
was
separated
from
Spanish
Yucatán
to
the
north
and
Spanish
Guatemala
to
the
south
by
thick
jungles
with
little
population
.

It
had
been
visited
by
Cortés
on
his
march
to
Honduras
in
0000
,
when
the
lords
of
the
Itza
pledged
loyalty
to
Spain
,
but
was
thereafter
neglected
by
Spanish
authorities
.

In
0000
two
Franciscan
friars
were
sent
from
Mérida
to
teach
Christianity
to
the
Itza
.

They
arrived
in
Tayasal
to
find
the
people
uninfluenced
by
European
ways
and
still
worshipping
the
traditional
Mesoamerica
n
gods
.

While
the
Itza
king
received
them
politely
,
they
made
no
progress
in
converting
the
people
to
Christianity
.

In
0000
,
the
Governor
of
Yucatán
sent
a
force
of
00
Spaniards
and
000
Christian
Indian
allies
to
march
on
Tayasal
,
but
the
Itza
quickly
killed
them
.

A
second
force
on
their
way
to
the
Petén
in
0000
was
ambushed
by
the
Itza
and
met
a
similar
fate
.

The
Governor
of
Yucatán
decided
his
energies
were
best
spent
elsewhere
,
and
the
Itza
continued
in
independence
.

In
the
00th
century
,
three
Maya
"
provinces
"
existed
in
the
Lake
Petén
area
.

They
are
Kan
Ek
'
(
Canek
)
,
Yalain
,
and
Kowoj
(
Couoh
)
.

The
Kan
Ek
'
may
have
been
the
dominant
"
province
"
in
the
end
of
the
00th
century
.

The
title
of
the
rulers
of
Kan
Ek
'
was
Aj
Kan
Ek
'
.

Since
the
late
0000s
,
the
last
Aj
Kan
Ek
'
started
a
more
open
attitude
towards
the
Spaniards
,
which
included
receiving
and
protecting
the
emissaries
from
the
Spaniards
at
Noj
Peten
(
also
known
as
Noh
Peten
or
Tayasal
)
.

In
0000
,
three
Franciscan
s
headed
to
Tayasal
accompanied
by
four
Christian
Maya
singers
.

They
were
well
received
,
and
a
number
of
the
Itza
consented
to
be
baptized
.

The
Itza
King
,
however
,
refused
to
convert
to
Christianity
or
pledge
loyalty
to
Spain
;
he
said
a
time
would
come
when
this
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
but
that
time
had
not
arrived
.

A
force
of
00
Spanish
soldiers
and
Maya
allies
were
sent
to
the
Petén
the
following
year
,
but
were
beaten
back
by
fierce
Itza
attacks
.

The
command
in
Mérida
decided
that
a
major
force
was
needed
,
and
in
0000
sent
out
a
force
of
000
Spanish
soldiers
and
tens
of
thousands
of
Xiu
Maya
under
the
command
of
Martín
de
Urzúa
y
Arizmendi
,
along
with
artillery
and
a
large
supply
train
of
mules
and
men
to
cut
a
path
through
the
jungle
.

They
set
up
a
fort
on
the
shore
of
Lake
Petén
Itza
across
from
Tayasal
,
and
reconstructed
a
small
warship
on
the
lake
which
had
been
brought
with
them
in
pieces
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
this
force
succeeded
in
conquering
the
Itza
capital
of
Tayasal
.

The
Spanish
burned
the
Itza
library
of
books
"
containing
lies
of
the
devil
"
,
and
reported
later
that
the
city
had
so
many
idols
that
with
almost
the
entire
army
set
at
work
,
it
took
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
half
past
five
in
the
evening
to
break
them
all
.

Mesoamerica
was
not
to
see
another
independent
native
state
for
over
a
hundred
years
.

The
Sinclair
Scientific
calculator
was
a
00-function
,
pocket-sized
calculator
sold
by
Sinclair
Radionics
for
about
$
000
in
the
USA
and
around
£
00
in
the
UK
.

The
Sinclair
Scientific
first
appeared
in
a
case
derived
from
that
of
the
Sinclair
Cambridge
,
but
it
was
not
part
of
the
same
range
.

At
the
time
it
was
launched
,
in
April
,
0000
,
it
was
a
highly
unusual
calculator
.

It
displays
only
in
scientific
notation
-
0
digit
mantissa
,
0
digit
exponent
.

Because
of
the
way
its
processor
(
a
custom
chip
from
Texas
Instruments
)
is
designed
,
it
relies
on
reverse
Polish
notation
(
RPN
)
.

This
unusual
method
of
mathematical
problem
solving
meant
that
,
for
instance
,
to
add
0
and
0
,
one
had
to
enter
0
,
then
0
,
then
the
+
symbol
.

There
was
no
=
key
.

The
Scientific
Programmable
was
an
advanced
version
launched
in
0000
,
again
using
reverse
Polish
notation
.

It
could
handle
programs
of
up
to
00
steps
and
cost
£
00.00
.

It
used
four
AAA
batteries
.

The
Scientific
Programmable
Mark
0
was
powered
either
by
a
0V
battery
or
a
mains
adaptor
and
cost
£
00.00
.

It
came
with
twelve
sample
programs
,
with
another
000
contained
in
an
additional
four-volume
library
which
could
be
bought
for
£
0.00
.

Each
volume
was
dedicated
to
a
different
application
:
finance
and
statistics
,
mathematics
,
physics
and
engineering
,
and
electronics
.

It
also
used
RPN
.

An
ingenious
aspect
of
the
design
which
showed
Sinclair
's
inventiveness
was
that
the
machine
made
use
of
what
was
originally
a
0-function
calculator
chip
.

Sinclair
realised
that
by
using
RPN
and
allowing
a
reduced
precision
of
0
or
0
significant
figures
displayed
in
scientific
notation
,
the
algorithms
for
scientific
functions
could
be
redesigned
and
compacted
to
fit
in
the
same
programmable
space
on
the
chip
.

This
allowed
Sinclair
to
adapt
the
relatively
low-cost
processor
and
produce
an
'
electronic
slide
rule
'
that
fitted
easily
in
a
shirt
pocket
,
at
a
price
that
even
impecunious
students
could
afford
.

As
a
consequence
of
the
compacted
logical
design
and
in
common
with
many
ground-breaking
inventions
,
operation
was
a
little
idiosyncratic
,
but
amazingly
flexible
with
familiarity
.

Keys
trebled
up
on
functionality
,
important
constants
were
printed
on
the
case
below
the
display
,
and
the
instruction
book
contained
many
useful
keystroke
sequences
for
common
functions
that
were
otherwise
absent
from
the
device
-
thus
making
the
calculator
much
more
versatile
than
the
keyboard
at
first
suggests
.

The
log/antilog
functions
used
natural
logs
and
the
trigonometric
functions
used
radian
s.
The
constants
printed
on
the
case
were
useful
when
converting
between
radians
and
degrees
,
and
between
log
base
00
and
log
base
e
.

Madeleine
Korbelová
Albright
(
born
May
00
,
0000
)
was
the
first
woman
to
become
the
United
States
Secretary
of
State
.

She
was
nominated
by
US
President
Bill
Clinton
on
December
0
,
0000
,
and
was
unanimously
confirmed
by
a
U.S.
Senate
vote
of
00
–
0
.

She
was
sworn
in
on
January
00
,
0000
.

Albright
currently
serves
as
a
Professor
of
International
Relations
at
Georgetown
University
's
Walsh
School
of
Foreign
Service
.

She
holds
a
PhD
from
Columbia
University
and
numerous
honorary
degrees
.

In
May
0000
,
she
was
awarded
the
Presidential
Medal
of
Freedom
by
US
President
Barack
Obama
.

Secretary
Albright
also
serves
as
a
Director
on
the
Board
of
the
Council
on
Foreign
Relations
.

Albright
is
fluent
in
English
,
French
,
Russian
,
and
Czech
;
she
speaks
and
reads
Polish
and
Serbo-Croatian
as
well
.

Personal
Early
life
Albright
was
born
Marie
Jana
Korbelová
(
)
in
the
Smíchov
district
of
Prague
,
Czechoslovakia
.

At
the
time
of
her
birth
,
Czechoslovakia
had
been
independent
for
less
than
twenty
years
,
having
gained
independence
from
Austria-Hungary
after
World
War
I
.

Her
father
,
Josef
Korbel
,
was
a
Czech
Jewish
diplomat
and
supporter
of
the
early
Czech
democrats
,
Tomáš
Garrigue
Masaryk
and
Edvard
Beneš
.

She
was
his
first
child
with
his
Jewish
wife
,
Anna
(
née
Spieglová
)
,
who
later
also
had
another
daughter
Katherine
(
a
schoolteacher
)
and
son
John
(
an
economist
)
.

At
the
time
of
Albright
’s
birth
,
her
father
was
serving
as
press-attaché
at
the
Czechoslovak
Embassy
in
Belgrade
.

However
,
the
signing
of
the
Munich
Agreement
in
March
0000
and
the
disintegration
of
Czechoslovakia
at
the
hands
of
Adolf
Hitler
forced
the
family
into
exile
because
of
their
links
with
Beneš
.

Prior
to
their
flight
,
Albright
's
parents
had
converted
from
Judaism
to
Roman
Catholicism
.

Albright
spent
the
war
years
in
England
,
while
her
father
worked
for
Beneš
’s
Czechoslovak
government-in-exile
.

They
first
lived
on
Kensington
Park
Road
in
Notting
Hill
,
London
,
where
they
endured
the
worst
of
The
Blitz
,
but
later
moved
to
Beaconsfield
,
then
Walton-on-Thames
,
on
the
outskirts
of
London
.

While
in
England
,
a
young
Albright
appeared
as
a
refugee
child
in
a
film
designed
to
promote
sympathy
for
all
war
refugees
in
London
.

Albright
was
raised
Catholic
,
but
converted
to
Episcopalianism
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
in
0000
.

Albright
did
not
learn
until
late
in
life
that
her
parents
were
Jewish
and
that
many
of
her
Jewish
relatives
in
Czechoslovakia
had
perished
in
The
Holocaust
,
including
three
of
her
grandparents
.

After
the
defeat
of
the
Nazis
in
the
European
Theatre
of
World
War
II
and
the
collapse
of
Nazi
Germany
and
the
Protectorate
of
Bohemia
and
Moravia
,
Albright
and
family
moved
back
to
Prague
,
where
they
were
given
a
luxurious
apartment
in
the
Hradčany
district
(
which
later
caused
controversy
,
as
it
had
belonged
to
an
ethnic
German
Bohemian
industrialist
family
forced
out
by
the
Beneš
decrees
–
see
"
Controversies
"
)
.

Korbel
was
named
Czechoslovak
Ambassador
to
communist
Yugoslavia
,
and
the
family
moved
to
Belgrade
.

Communists
governed
Yugoslavia
,
and
Korbel
was
concerned
his
daughter
would
be
indoctrinated
with
Marxist
ideology
in
a
Yugoslav
school
,
so
she
was
taught
by
a
governess
and
later
sent
to
the
Prealpina
Institut
pour
Jeunes
Filles
in
Chexbres
,
on
Lake
Geneva
in
Switzerland
.

Here
,
she
learned
French
and
went
by
Madeleine
,
the
French
version
of
Madlenka
,
her
Czech
nickname
.

However
,
the
Communist
Party
of
Czechoslovakia
took
over
the
government
in
0000
,
with
support
from
the
Soviet
Union
,
and
as
an
opponent
of
Communism
,
Korbel
was
forced
to
resign
from
his
position
.

He
later
obtained
a
position
on
a
United
Nations
delegation
to
Kashmir
,
and
sent
his
family
to
the
United
States
,
by
way
of
London
,
to
wait
for
him
when
he
arrived
to
deliver
his
report
to
the
U.N.
Headquarters
,
then
in
Lake
Success
,
New
York
.

The
family
arrived
in
New
York
City
,
New
York
,
in
November
0000
,
and
initially
settled
in
Great
Neck
,
on
Long
Island
,
New
York
.

Korbel
applied
for
political
asylum
,
arguing
that
as
an
opponent
of
Communism
,
he
was
now
under
threat
in
Prague
.

With
the
help
of
Philip
Mosely
,
a
professor
of
Russian
at
Columbia
University
in
New
York
City
,
Korbel
obtained
a
position
on
the
staff
of
the
political
science
department
at
the
University
of
Denver
in
Denver
,
Colorado
.

He
became
dean
of
the
university
’s
Josef
Korbel
School
of
International
Studies
,
and
later
taught
future
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
Condoleezza
Rice
.

Life
in
the
United
States
Albright
spent
her
teen
years
in
Denver
,
and
graduated
from
the
Kent
Denver
School
in
Cherry
Hills
Village
,
a
suburb
of
Denver
,
in
0000
,
where
she
founded
the
school
’s
international
relations
club
and
was
its
first
president
.

She
attended
Wellesley
College
,
in
Wellesley
,
Massachusetts
,
on
a
full
scholarship
,
majoring
in
political
science
and
graduated
in
0000
.

Her
senior
thesis
was
written
on
Czech
Communist
Zdeněk
Fierlinger
.

She
became
a
U.S.
citizen
in
0000
,
and
joined
the
College
Democrats
of
America
.

While
home
in
Denver
from
Wellesley
,
Albright
worked
as
an
intern
for
The
Denver
Post
,
where
she
met
Joseph
Medill
Patterson
Albright
,
the
nephew
of
Alicia
Patterson
,
owner
of
Newsday
and
wife
of
philanthropist
Harry
Frank
Guggenheim
.

The
couple
were
married
in
Wellesley
in
0000
,
shortly
after
her
graduation
.

They
lived
first
in
Rolla
,
Missouri
,
while
he
served
his
military
service
at
nearby
Fort
Leonard
Wood
.

During
this
time
,
she
worked
at
the
Rolla
Daily
News
.

In
January
0000
,
the
couple
moved
to
his
hometown
of
Chicago
,
Illinois
,
where
he
worked
at
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
as
a
journalist
,
and
Albright
worked
as
a
picture
editor
for
Encyclopædia
Britannica
.

The
following
year
,
Joseph
Albright
began
work
at
Newsday
in
New
York
City
,
and
the
couple
moved
to
Garden
City
on
Long
Island
.

That
year
,
she
gave
birth
to
twin
daughters
,
Alice
Patterson
Albright
and
Anne
Korbel
Albright
.

The
twins
were
born
six
weeks
premature
,
and
required
a
long
hospital
stay
,
so
as
a
distraction
,
Albright
began
Russian
classes
at
Hofstra
University
in
Village
of
Hempstead
,
New
York
.

In
0000
,
the
family
moved
to
Georgetown
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
and
Albright
began
studying
international
relations
and
continued
studying
Russian
at
the
Paul
H.
Nitze
School
of
Advanced
International
Studies
at
Johns
Hopkins
University
in
Washington
DC
.

However

Alicia
Patterson
died
,
and
the
family
returned
to
Long
Island
with
the
notion
of
Joseph
taking
over
the
family
business
.

Albright
gave
birth
to
another
daughter
,
Katherine
Medill
Albright
,
in
0000
,
and
continued
her
studies
at
Columbia
University
's
Department
of
Public
Law
and
Government
(
later
renamed
as
the
political
science
department
,
which
is
located
within
the
School
of
International
and
Public
Affairs
)
.

She
earned
a
certificate
in
Russian
,
a
Masters
of
Arts
and
Doctor
of
Philosophy
,
writing
her
Master
's
thesis
on
the
Soviet
diplomatic
corps
,
and
her
doctoral
dissertation
on
the
role
of
journalists
in
the
Prague
Spring
of
0000
.

She
also
took
a
graduate
course
given
by
Zbigniew
Brzezinski
,
who
would
later
be
her
boss
at
the
U.S.
National
Security
Council
.

Career
Early
career
Albright
returned
to
Washington
in
0000
,
and
commuted
to
Columbia
for
her
PhD
,
which
she
received
in
0000
.

She
began
fund-raising
for
her
daughters
'
school
,
involvement
which
led
to
several
positions
on
education
boards
.

She
was
eventually
invited
to
organize
a
fund-raising
dinner
for
the
0000
presidential
campaign
of
U.S.
Senator
Ed
Muskie
of
Maine
.

This
association
with
Muskie
led
to
a
position
as
his
chief
legislative
assistant
in
0000
.

However
,
after
the
0000
U.S.
presidential
election
of
Jimmy
Carter
,
Albright
's
former
professor
Brzezinski
was
named
National
Security
Advisor
,
and
recruited
Albright
from
Muskie
in
0000
to
work
in
the
West
Wing
as
the
National
Security
Council
’s
congressional
liaison
.

Following
Carter
's
loss
in
0000
to
Ronald
Reagan
,
Albright
moved
on
to
the
Woodrow
Wilson
International
Center
for
Scholars
at
the
Smithsonian
Institution
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
where
she
was
given
a
grant
for
a
research
project
.

She
chose
to
write
on
the
dissident
journalists
involved
in
Poland
's
Solidarity
movement
,
then
in
its
infancy
but
gaining
international
attention
.

She
traveled
to
Poland
for
her
research
,
interviewing
dissidents
in
Gdansk
,
Warsaw
and
Krakow
.

Upon
her
return
to
Washington
,
her
husband
announced
his
intention
to
divorce
her
for
another
woman
.

Albright
joined
the
academic
staff
at
Georgetown
University
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
in
0000
,
specializing
in
Eastern
European
studies
.

She
has
also
directed
the
University
's
program
on
women
in
global
politics
.

She
has
also
served
as
a
major
Democratic
Party
foreign
policy
advisor
,
and
briefed
Vice-Presidential
candidate
Geraldine
Ferraro
in
0000
and
Presidential
candidate
Michael
Dukakis
in
0000
(
both
campaigns
ended
in
defeat
)
.

In
0000
,
Bill
Clinton
returned
the
White
House
to
the
Democratic
Party
,
and
Albright
was
employed
to
handle
the
transition
to
a
new
administration
at
the
National
Security
Council
.

In
January
0000
,
Clinton
nominated
her
to
be
U.S.
Ambassador
to
the
United
Nations
,
her
first
diplomatic
posting
.

U.S.
Ambassador
to
the
United
Nations
Albright
was
appointed
Ambassador
to
the
United
Nations
,
her
first
diplomatic
post
,
shortly
after
Clinton
was
inaugurated
,
presenting
her
credentials
on
February
0
,
0000
.

During
her
tenure
at
the
U.N.
,
she
had
a
rocky
relationship
with
the
U.N.
Secretary-General
,
Boutros
Boutros-Ghali
,
who
she
criticized
as
"
disengaged
"
and
"
neglect
[
ful
]
"
of
genocide
in
Rwanda
.

Albright
wrote
:
My
deepest
regret
from
my
years
in
public
service
is
the
failure
of
the
United
States
and
the
international
community
to
act
sooner
to
halt
these
crimes
.

In
Shake
Hands
with
the
Devil
,
Roméo
Dallaire
claims
that
in
0000
,
in
Albright
's
role
as
the
U.S.
Permanent
Representative
to
the
U.N.
,
she
avoided
describing
the
killings
in
Rwanda
as
"
genocide
"
until
overwhelmed
by
the
evidence
for
it
;
this
is
now
how
she
describes
these
massacres
in
her
memoirs
.

She
was
instructed
to
support
a
reduction
or
withdrawal
(
something
which
never
happened
)
of
the
U.N.
Assistance
Mission
for
Rwanda
but
was
later
given
more
flexibility
.

Albright
later
remarked
in
PBS
documentary
Ghosts
of
Rwanda
that
it
was
a
very
,
very
difficult
time
,
and
the
situation
was
unclear
.

You
know
,
in
retrospect
,
it
all
looks
very
clear
.

But
when
you
were
[
there
]
at
the
time
,
it
was
unclear
about
what
was
happening
in
Rwanda
.
"

Also
in
0000
,
after
Cuban
military
pilots
shot
down
two
small
civilian
aircraft
flown
by
the
Cuban-American
exile
group
Brothers
to
the
Rescue
over
international
waters
,
she
announced
,
"
This
is
not
cojones
.

This
is
cowardice
.
"

The
line
endeared
her
to
President
Clinton
,
who
said
it
was
"
probably
the
most
effective
one-liner
in
the
whole
administration
's
foreign
policy
.
"

On
May
00
,
0000
,
Albright
defended
UN
sanctions
against
Iraq
on
a
00
Minutes
segment
in
which
Lesley
Stahl
asked
her
"
We
have
heard
that
half
a
million
children
have
died
.

I
mean
,
that
's
more
children
than
died
in
Hiroshima
.

And
,
you
know
,
is
the
price
worth
it
?
"

and
Albright
replied
"
we
think
the
price
is
worth
it
.
"

Albright
later
criticized
Stahl
's
segment
as
"
amount
[
ing
]
to
Iraqi
propaganda
"
;
said
that
her
question
was
a
loaded
question
;
wrote
"
I
had
fallen
into
a
trap
and
said
something
I
did
not
mean
"
;
and
regretted
coming
"
across
as
cold-blooded
and
cruel
"
.

Sanctions
critics
took
Albright
's
failure
to
reframe
the
question
as
confirmation
of
the
statistic
.

The
segment
won
an
Emmy
Award
.

Secretary
of
State
When
Albright
took
office
as
the
00th
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
on
January
00
,
0000
,
she
became
the
first
female
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
and
the
highest-ranking
woman
in
the
history
of
the
U.S.
government
.

Not
being
a
natural-born
citizen
of
the
U.S.
,
she
was
not
eligible
as
a
U.S.
Presidential
successor
and
was
excluded
from
nuclear
contingency
plans
.

In
her
position
as
Secretary
of
State
,
Albright
reinforced
the
U.S.
's
alliances
;
advocated
democracy
and
human
rights
;
and
promoted
American
trade
and
business
,
labor
and
environmental
standards
abroad
.

During
her
tenure
,
Albright
considerably
influenced
American
policy
in
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
and
the
Middle
East
.

She
incurred
the
wrath
of
a
number
of
Serbs
in
the
former
Yugoslavia
for
her
role
in
participating
in
the
formulation
of
US
policy
during
the
Kosovo
War
and
Bosnian
war
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
Balkans
.

But
,
together
with
President
Bill
Clinton
,
she
remains
a
largely
popular
figure
in
the
rest
of
the
region
,
especially
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
,
Kosovo
,
and
Croatia
.

According
to
Albright
's
memoirs
,
she
once
argued
with
Colin
Powell
for
the
use
of
military
force
by
asking
,
"
What
’s
the
point
of
you
saving
this
superb
military
for
,
Colin
,
if
we
ca
n't
use
it
?
"

As
Secretary
of
State
she
represented
the
U.S.
at
the
Transfer
of
sovereignty
over
Hong
Kong
on
July
0
,
0000
.

She
boycotted
the
swearing-in
ceremony
of
the
China-appointed
Hong
Kong
Legislative
Council
,
which
replaced
the
elected
one
,
along
with
the
British
contingents
.

According
to
several
accounts
,
U.S.
Ambassador
to
Kenya
Prudence
Bushnell
repeatedly
asked
Washington
for
additional
security
at
the
embassy
in
Nairobi
,
including
in
an
April
0000
letter
directly
to
Albright
.

In
"
Against
All
Enemies
,
"
Richard
Clarke
writes
about
an
exchange
with
Albright
several
months
after
the
US
embassies
in
Kenya
and
Tanzania
were
bombed
in
August
0000
.
"

What
do
you
think
will
happen
if
you
lose
another
embassy
?
"

The
Republicans
in
Congress
will
go
after
you
.
"
"

First
of
all
,
I
did
n't
lose
these
two
embassies
,
"
Albright
shot
back
.
"

I
inherited
them
in
the
shape
they
were
.
"

Albright
was
booed
in
0000
when
the
brief
war
threat
with
Iraq
revealed
that
citizens
were
opposed
to
such
an
invasion
,
although
this
is
often
overlooked
.

In
0000
,
at
the
NATO
summit
,
Albright
articulated
what
would
become
known
as
the
"
three
Ds
"
of
NATO
,
"
which
is
no
diminution
of
NATO
,
no
discrimination
and
no
duplication
–
because
I
think
that
we
do
n't
need
any
of
those
three
"
Ds
"
to
happen
.
"

Both
Bill
Clinton
and
Albright
insisted
that
an
attack
on
Hussein
could
be
stopped
only
if
Hussein
reversed
his
decision
to
halt
arms
inspections
.
"

Iraq
has
a
simple
choice
.

Reverse
course
or
face
the
consequences
,
"
Albright
said
.

In
0000
,
Albright
became
one
of
the
highest
level
Western
diplomats
ever
to
meet
Kim
Jong-il
,
the
communist
leader
of
North
Korea
,
during
an
official
state
visit
to
that
country
.

In
one
of
her
last
acts
as
Secretary
of
State
,
Albright
on
January
0
,
0000
,
paid
a
farewell
call
on
Kofi
Annan
and
said
that
the
U.S.
would
continue
to
press
Iraq
to
destroy
all
its
weapons
of
mass
destruction
as
a
condition
of
lifting
economic
sanctions
,
even
after
the
end
of
the
Clinton
administration
on
January
00
,
0000
.

Post-0000
career
Following
Albright
's
term
as
Secretary
of
State
,
many
speculated
that
she
might
pursue
a
career
in
Czech
politics
.

Czech
President
Václav
Havel
talked
openly
about
the
possibility
of
Albright
succeeding
him
after
he
retired
in
0000
.

Albright
was
reportedly
flattered
by
suggestions
that
she
should
run
for
office
,
but
denied
ever
seriously
considering
it
.

She
was
the
second
recipient
of
the
Hanno
R.
Ellenbogen
Citizenship
Award
presented
by
the
Prague
Society
for
International
Cooperation
.

In
0000
,
Albright
was
elected
a
Fellow
of
the
American
Academy
of
Arts
and
Sciences
.

The
same
year
,
she
founded
the
Albright
Group
,
an
international
strategy
consulting
firm
based
in
Washington
,
D.C.
.

It
has
Coca-Cola
,
Merck
,
Dubai
Ports
World
,
and
Marsh
&
McLennan
Companies
among
its
clients
,
who
benefit
from
the
access
that
Albright
has
through
her
global
contacts
.

Affiliated
with
the
firm
is
Albright
Capital
Management
,
which
was
founded

,
she
accepted
a
position
on
the
Board

Directors
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

In
0000
,
Albright
declined
to
run
for
re-election
to
the
board
in
the
aftermath
of
the
Richard
Grasso
compensation
scandal
,
in
which
Grasso
,
the
chairman
of
the
NYSE
Board
of
Directors
,
had
been
granted
$
000.0
million
in
compensation
,
with
little
governance
by
the
board
on
which
Albright
sat
.

During
the
tenure
of
the
interim
chairman
,
John
S.
Reed
,
Albright
served
as
chairwoman
of
the
NYSE
board
's
nominating
and
governance
committee
.

Shortly
after
the
appointment
of
the
NYSE
board
's
permanent
chairman
in
0000
,
Albright
submitted
her
resignation
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
Albright
guest
starred
on
the
television
drama
Gilmore
Girls
as

.

On

,
she
participated
in
a

at
the
White
House
of
former
Secretaries
of
Defense
and
State
to
discuss
U.S.
foreign
policy
with
George
W.
Bush
administration
officials
.

On
May
0
,
0000
,
she
was
again
invited
to
the
White
House
to
meet
with
former
Secretaries
and
Bush
administration
officials
to
discuss
Iraq
.

Albright
currently

In
an
interview
given
to
Newsweek
International
published
July

,
0000
,
Albright
gave
her
opinion
on
current
U.S.
foreign
policy
.

Albright
said
:
"
I
hope
I
'm
wrong
,
but
I
'm
afraid
that
Iraq
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
the
greatest
disaster
in
American
foreign
policy
–
worse
than
Vietnam
.
"

In
September
0000
,
she
received
the
Menschen
in
Europa
Award
,
with
Václav
Havel
,
for
furthering
the
cause
of
international
understanding
.

Albright

fitness
and
exercise
regimen
in
several
interviews
.

She
has
said
she
is
capable
of
leg
press
ing

Albright
was
listed
as
one
of
the
fifty
best-dressed
over

and
the
Armenian
National

of
America
.

Albright
endorsed
and
supported
Hillary

in
her

.

Albright
has
been
a

Philipp
Harmer
,
launched
legal
action
against
Albright
,
claiming
Josef
Korbel
had
illegally
taken
possession
of
artwork
which
belonged
to
his
great-grandfather
,
Karl
Nebrich
.

Nebrich
,
a
German-speaking
Prague
industrialist
,
was
forced
to
abandon
some
of
his
possessions
when
ethnic
Germans
were
expelled
from
the
country
after
World
War
II
under
the
Beneš
decrees
.

His
apartment
,
at
00
Hradčanská
Street
in
Prague
,
was
subsequently
given
to
Korbel
and
his
family
,
which
they
occupied
before
also
being
forced
to
flee
to
America
.

Harmer
felt
Korbel
stole
his
great-grandfather
's
artwork
,
which
was
left
in
the
apartment
.

The
matter
was
handled
by
Albright
's
brother
,
John
Korbel
.

Radovan
KaradžićDuring
his
first
hearing
in
front
of
the
International
Criminal
Tribunal
for
the
former
Yugoslavia
,
Radovan
Karadžić
stated
that
Albright
along
with
Richard
Holbrooke
offered
him
a
deal
which
would
allow
him
avoid
prosecution
for
asserted
war
crimes
if
he
left
public
life
and
politics
.

According
to
Karadžić
,
Albright
offered
him
a
chance
to
relocate
to
Russia
,
Greece
,
or
Serbia
and
open
a
private
clinic
,
or
to
go
to
Bijeljina
.

Karadžić
was
quoted
as
saying
that
Holbrooke
or
Albright
would
like
to
see
him
disappear
and
expressed
the
fear
for
his
life
by
saying
"
I
do
not
know
how
long
the
arm
of
Mr
Holbrooke
or
Mrs
Albright
is
...
or
whether
that
arm
can
reach
me
here
"
.

Allegations
of
hate
speech
in
PragueIn
late
October
0000
,
during
a
book
signing
in
the
Prague
bookstore
Palác
Knih
Luxor
,
Albright
was
visited
by
a
group
of
activists
from
the
Czech
organization
"
Přátelé
Srbů
na
Kosovu
"
.

She
was
filmed
saying
"
Disgusting
Serbs
,
get
out
!
"

to
the
Czech
group
,
which
had
brought
war
photos
to
the
signing
,
some
of
which
showed
Serbian
victims
of
the
Kosovo
War
in
0000
.

The
protesters
were
expelled
from
the
event
when
police
arrived
.

Two
videos
of
the
incident
were
later
posted
by
the
group
on
their
Youtube
channel
.

Filmmaker
Emir
Kusturica
expressed
thanks
to
Czech
director
Václav
Dvořák
for
organizing
and
participating
in
the
demonstration
.

Together
with
other
protesters
,
Dvořák
also
reported
Albright
to
the
police
,
stating
that
she
was
spreading
ethnic
hatred
and
disrespect
to
the
victims
of
the
war
.

Albright
's
involvement
in
the
NATO
bombing
of
Serbia
was
the
main
cause
of
the
demonstration
–
a
sensitive
topic
which
became
even
more
controversial
when
it
was
revealed
that
her
investment
firm
,
Albright
Capital
Management
,
was
preparing
to
bid
in
the
proposed
privatization
of
Kosovo
's
state-owned
telecom
and
postal
company
,
Post
and
Telecom
of
Kosovo
.

In
an
article
published
by
the
New
York-based
magazine
Bloomberg
Businessweek
,
it
was
estimated
that
the
deal
could
be
as
large
as
€
000
million
.

Serbia
opposed
the
sale
,
and
intended
to
file
a
lawsuit
to
block
it
,
alleging
that
the
rights
of
former
Serbian
employees
were
not
respected
.

Jesse
Alexander
Helms
,
Jr.
.

(
October
00
,
0000
–
July
0
,
0000
)
was
a
five-term
Republican
United
States
Senator
from
North
Carolina
who
served
as
chairman
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
from
0000
to
0000
.

A
leading
conservative
,
he
helped
organize
and
fund
the
conservative
resurgence
in
the
0000s
,
aiding
Ronald
Reagan
's
quest
for
the
White
House
and
helping
many
local
and
regional
candidates
.

A
journalist
by
training
,
Helms
was
the
longest-serving
popularly
elected
Senator
in
North
Carolina
's
history
,
and
was
widely
credited
with
shifting
the
one-party
state
dominated
by
the
Democrats
into
a
competitive
two-party
state
.

The
Helms-controlled
National
Congressional
Club
's
state-of-the-art
direct
mail
operation
raised
millions
for
Helms
and
other
conservative
candidates
allowing
Helms
to
outspend
his
opponents
in
most
of
his
campaigns
.

An
unreconstructed
Southern
conservative
,
he
began
his
political
career
in
the
Democratic
Party
in
the
days
when
many
white
Southern
politicians
championed
racial
segregation
.

He
moved
to
the
Republican
party
in
the
0000s
.

Helms
was
the
most
stridently
conservative
politician
of
the
post-0000s
era
,
especially
in
opposition
to
federal
intervention
into
what
he
considered
state
affairs
(
integration
,
the
Civil
Rights
Act
and
the
Voting
Rights
Act
)
.

Helms
tried
,
with
a
00-day
filibuster
,
to
stop
the
Senate
from
approving
a
federal
holiday
to
honor
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr.
Helms
was
credited
even
by
his
most
vociferous
opponents
with
providing
excellent
constituent
services
through
his
Senate
office
.

As
long-time
chairman
of
the
powerful
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
he
demanded
a
staunchly
anti-communist
foreign
policy
that
would
reward
America
's
friends
abroad
,
and
punish
its
enemies
.

His
relations
with
the
State
Department
were
often
acrimonious
,
and
he
blocked
numerous
presidential
appointees
.

However
,
he
worked
smoothly
with
Secretary
of
State
Madeleine
Albright
.

In
domestic
affairs
,
Helms
promoted
industrial
development
in
the
South
,
seeking
low
taxes
and
few
labor
unions
so
as
to
attract
northern
and
international
corporations
to
relocate
to
North
Carolina
.

On
social
issues
,
Helms
was
a
traditionalist
.

He
was
a
"
master
obstructionist
"
who
relished
his
nickname
,
"
Senator
No
"
.

He
opposed
,
at
various
times
,
civil
rights
,
disability
rights
,
feminism
,
gay
rights
,
affirmative
action
,
abortion
,
and
government
support
for
contemporary
art
with
graphic
sexuality
.

Helms
brought
an
"
aggressiveness
"
to
his
conservatism
,
as
in
his
rhetoric
against
homosexuality
,
and
employed
racially
charged
language
in
his
campaigns
and
editorials
.

He
combined
cultural
,
social
and
economic
conservatism
which
often
helped
his
legislation
win
overwhelming
support
.

The
Almanac
of
American
Politics
once
wrote
that
"
no
American
politician
is
more
controversial
,
beloved
in
some
quarters
and
hated
in
others
,
than
Jesse
Helms
"
.

Childhood
and
education
(
0000
—
0000
)
Helms
was
born
in
Monroe
,
North
Carolina
,
where
his
father
,
nicknamed
"
Big
Jesse
"
,
served
as
both
fire
chief
and
chief
of
police
;
his
mother
,
Ethel
Mae
Helms
,
was
a
homemaker
.

Helms
was
of
English
ancestry
on
both
sides
.

Helms
briefly
attended
Wingate
Junior
College
,
now
Wingate
University
,
near
Monroe
,
before
leaving
for
Wake
Forest
College
.

He
left
Wingate
after
a
year
to
begin
a
career
as
a
journalist
,
having
worked
for
the
next
eleven
years
as
a
newspaper
and
radio
reporter
,
first
as
a
sportswriter
and
news
reporter
for
the
Raleigh
News
and
Observer
,
and
also
as
assistant
city
editor
for
The
Raleigh
Times
.

Helms
met
Dorothy
"
Dot
"
Coble
,
editor
of
the
society
page
at
The
News
&
Observer
,
and
they
married
in
0000
.

Helms
'
first
interest
in
politics
came
from
conversations
with
his
conservative
father-in-law
.

Early
career
(
0000
—
0000
)
Helms
's
first
full-time
job
after
college
was
as
a
sports
reporter
with
The
Raleigh
Times
.

During
World
War
II
,
Helms
served
stateside
as
a
recruiter
in
the
United
States
Navy
.

In
0000
,
his
first
child
,
Jane
,
was
born
.

After
the
war
,
he
pursued
his
twin
interests
of
journalism
and
Democratic
party
politics
.

Helms
became
the
city
news
editor
of
The
Raleigh
Times
,
and
later
became
a
radio
and
television
newscaster
and
commentator
with
a
large
statewide
audience
.

Entry
into
politics
In
0000
,
Helms
played
a
critical
role
as
campaign
publicity
director
for
Willis
Smith
in
the
U.S.
Senate
campaign
against
a
prominent
liberal
Frank
Porter
Graham
.

Graham
,
who
supported
school
desegregation
,
was
labelled
by
Smith
(
a
conservative
Democratic
lawyer
and
former
president
of
the
American
Bar
Association
)
as
a
"
dupe
of
communists
"
and
a
proponent
of
the
"
mingling
of
the
races
"
,
as
played
out
on
fliers
including
the
phrase
"
Wake
Up
,
White
People
"
in
the
virtually
all-white
Democratic
primaries
.

Smith
won
and
hired
Helms
to
be
his
administrative
assistant
in
Washington
.

In
0000
,
Helms
worked
on
the
presidential
campaign
of
Georgia
Senator
Richard
B.
Russell
.

After
Russell
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
race
,
Helms
returned
to
working
for
Smith
.

When
Smith
died
in
0000
,
Helms
returned
to
Raleigh
and
,
from
0000
to
0000
,
was
executive
director
of
the
North
Carolina
Bankers
Association
.

He
set
up
a
home
on
Caswell
Street
in
the
Hayes
Barton
Historic
District
,
where
he
lived
until
he
died
.

In
0000
,
Helms
won
his
first
election
for
a
Raleigh
City
Council
seat
,
and
served
two
terms
and
earned
a
reputation
as
a
conservative
gadfly
who
"
fought
against
everything
from
putting
a
median
strip
on
Downtown
Boulevard
to
an
urban
renewal
project
"
.

In
0000
,
Helms
worked
on
the
unsuccessful
primary
gubernatorial
campaign
of
I.
Beverly
Lake
,
Sr.
,
who
ran
on
a
platform
of
racial
segregation
.

The
U.S
Supreme
Court
had
recently
handed
down
the
Cooper
v.
Aaron
decision
insisting
on
the
dismantling
of
segregated
school
systems
,
and
that
,
combined
with
the
lunch-counter
demonstrations
in
Greensboro
,
compelled
him
to
run
.

Lake
lost
to
Terry
Sanford
,
who
ran
as
a
racial
moderate
willing
to
implement
the
federal
policy
of
school
integration
.

Helms
felt
forced
busing
and
forced
racial
integration
caused
animosity
on
both
sides
and
"
proved
to
be
unwise
"
.

Capitol
Broadcasting
Company
In
0000
,
Helms
joined
the
Raleigh-based
Capitol
Broadcasting
Company
(
CBC
)
as
the
executive
vice-president
,
vice
chairman
of
the
board
,
and
assistant
chief
executive
officer
.

His
daily
CBC
editorials
on
WRAL-TV
,
given
at
the
end
of
each
night
's
local
news
broadcast
in
Raleigh
,
made
Helms
famous
as
a
conservative
commentator
throughout
eastern
North
Carolina
.

Helms
's
editorials
featured
folksy
anecdotes
interwoven
with
conservative
views
against
,
amongst
others
,
"
the
civil
rights
movement
,
the
liberal
news
media
,
and
anti-war
churches
"
.

He
referred
to
The
News
and
Observer
,
his
former
employer
,
as
the
"
Nuisance
and
Disturber
"
for
its
promotion
of
liberal
views
and
support
for
civil
rights
activity
.

The
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Chapel
Hill
,
which
had
a
reputation
for
liberalism
,
was
also
a
frequent
target
of
Helms
's
criticism
.

He
referred
to
the
university
as
"
The
University
of
Negroes
and
Communists
"
,
and
suggested
a
wall
be
erected
around
the
campus
to
prevent
the
university
's
liberal
views
from
"
infecting
"
the
rest
of
the
state
.

Helms
said
the
civil
rights
movement
was
infested
by
communists
and
"
moral
degenerates
"
,
and
described
Medicaid
as
a
"
step
over
into
the
swampy
field
of
socialized
medicine
"
.

On
the
0000
civil
rights
protests
,
Helms
stated
,
"
The
negro
can
not
count
forever
on
the
kind
of
restraint
that
's
thus
far
left
him
free
to
clog
the
streets
,
disrupt
traffic
,
and
interfere
with
other
men
's
rights
.
"

He
later
wrote
,
"
Crime
rates
and
irresponsibility
among
negroes
are
a
fact
of
life
which
must
be
faced
"
.

Although
his
editorials
created
controversy
,
they
also
made
him
popular
with
conservative
voters
,
helping
him
to
win
re-election
to
the
Raleigh
City
Council
.

He
served
for
four
years
.

He
was
at
Capitol
Broadcasting
Company
until
he
filed
for
the
Senate
race
in
0000
.

Senate
campaign
of
0000
Helms
announced
his
candidacy
for
a
seat
in
the
United
States
Senate
in
0000
.

His
Republican
primary
campaign
was
managed
by
Thomas
F.
Ellis
,
who
would
later
be
instrumental
in
Ronald
Reagan
's
0000
campaign
and
also
become
the
chair
of
the
National
Congressional
Club
.

Helms
took
the
Republican
primary
,
winning
00,000
votes
,
or
00.0
%
,
in
a
three-candidate
field
.

Meanwhile
,
Democrats
retired
the
ailing
Senator
B.
Everett
Jordan
,
who
lost
his
primary
to
Congressman
Nick
Galifianakis
,
who
represented
the
"
new
politics
"
of
the
young
,
the
African-Americans
,
and
the
anti-establishment
,
based
around
the
urban
Research
Triangle
and
Piedmont
Triad
.

Although
Galifianakis
was
a
"
liberal
"
by
North
Carolina
standards
,
he
opposed
busing
.

Polls
put
Galifianakis
well
ahead
until
late
in
the
campaign
,
but
Helms
,
facing
all
but
certain
defeat
,
hired
a
professional
campaign
manager
,
F.
Clifton
White
,
giving
him
dictatorial
control
over
campaign
strategy
.

While
Galifianakis
avoided
mention
of
his
party
's
presidential
candidate
,
the
liberal
George
McGovern
,
Helms
employed
the
slogans
"
McGovernGalifianakis
–
one
and
the
same
"
,
"
Vote
for
Jesse
.

Nixon
Needs
Him
"
and
"
Jesse
:
He
's
One
of
Us
"
,
an
implicit
play
on
his
opponent
's
Greek
heritage
.

Helms
won
the
support
of
a
large
number
of
Democrats
,
especially
in
the
conservative
eastern
part
of
the
state
.

Galifianakis
,
for
his
part
,
attempted
to
woo
Republicans
by
pointing
to
Helms
's
earlier
criticism
of
Nixon
as
being
too
left-wing
.

In
a
taste
of
things
to
come
,
money
poured
into
the
race
.

Helms
spent
a
record
$
000,000
,
much
of
it
going
toward
carefully
crafted
television
commercials
portraying
the
candidate
as
a
soft-spoken
mainstream
conservative
.

In
the
final
six
weeks
of
the
campaign
Helms
outspent
Galifianakis
three-to-one
.

Though
the
year
was
marked
by
Democratic
gains
in
the
Senate
,
Helms
won
00
percent
of
the
vote
to
Galifianakis
's
00
percent
and
became
the
first
Republican
senator
from
the
state
since
0000
:
before
senators
were
directly
elected
.

Helms
was
helped
by
Richard
Nixon
's
gigantic
landslide
victory
in
that
year
's
presidential
election
;
Nixon
carried
North
Carolina
by
00
points
.

First
Senate
term
(
0000
—
00
)
Entering
the
Senate
Helms
quickly
became
a
"
star
"
of
the
conservative
movement
,
and
was
particularly
vociferous
on
the
issue
of
abortion
.

In
0000
,
in
the
wake
of
Roe
v.
Wade
,
Helms
introduced
a
constitutional
amendment
that
would
have
prohibited
abortion
in
all
circumstances
,
by
conferring
due
process
rights
upon
every
fetus
.

However
,
the
Senate
hearing
into
the
proposed
amendments
heard
that
neither
Helms
's
,
nor
James
L.
Buckley
's
similar
amendment
,
would
achieve
their
stated
goal
,
shelving
them
for
the
session
.

However
,
both
Helms
and
Buckley
proposed
amendments
again
in
0000
,
with
Helms
's
allowing
states
leeway
in
their
implementation
of
an
enshrined
constitutional
"
right
to
life
"
from
the
"
moment
of
fertilization
"
.

Helms
was
also
prominent
as
a
champion
of
free
enterprise
,
and
favored
cutting
the
budget
.

He
was
a
strong
advocate
of
a
global
return
to
the
gold
standard
,
which
he
would
push
at
numerous
points
throughout
his
Senate
career
;
in
October
0000
,
Helms
proposed
a
successful
amendment
that
allowed
United
States
citizens
to
sign
contracts
linked
to
gold
,
overturning
a
00-year
ban
on
gold-indexed
contracts
,
reflecting
fears
of
inflation
.

Helms
was
a
supporter
of
the
tobacco
industry
,
which
contributed
over
0
%
of
the
state
's
GSP
until
the
0000s
(
the
highest
in
the
country
)
,
arguing
that
price
support
programs
should
be
maintained
,
as
they
did
not
constitute
a
subsidy
but
insurance
.

Hubert
Humphrey
once
said
,
"
I
'll
trade
Jesse
Helms
his
tobacco
vote
for
my
wheat
support
any
day
.
"

Tobacco
companies
such
as
R.
J.
Reynolds
and
Philip
Morris
had
supported
him
,
both
directly
and
through
donations
to
the
Jesse
Helms
Center
.

Foreign
policy
From
the
start
,
he
marked
himself
out
as
a
prominent
anti-communist
.

He
proposed
an
act
in
0000
that
authorized
the
President
to
grant
honorary
citizenship
to
Soviet
dissident
Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn
.

He
remained
close
to
Solzhenitsyn
's
cause
,
and
linked
his
fight
to
that
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
.

In
0000
,
as
North
Vietnam
ese
forces
approached
Saigon
,
he
was
foremost
amongst
those
urging
an
evacuation
of
all
Vietnamese
demanding
evacuation
,
which
he
believed
could
be
"
two
million
or
more
within
seven
days
"
.

When
the
Senate
Armed
Services
Committee
voted
to
suppress
a
report
critical
of
the
U.S.
's
strategic
position
in
the
arms
race
,
Helms
read
the
entire
report
out
,
requiring
it
to
be
published
in
the
Congressional
Record
.

Helms
was
not
originally
a
supporter
of
Israel
,
proposing
in
0000
a
resolution
demanding
Israel
return
the
West
Bank
to
Jordan
,
and
,
in
0000
,
demanding
that
the
Palestinian
Arabs
receive
a
"
just
settlement
of
their
grievances
"
.

In
0000
,
Helms
was
the
sole
senator
to
vote
against
prohibiting
American
companies
from
joining
the
Arab
League
boycott
of
Israel
,
although
this
was
primarily
because
the
bill
also
relaxed
discrimination
against
communist
countries
.

In
0000
,
Helms
even
called
for
the
U.S.
to
break
diplomatic
relations
with
Israel
during
the
0000
Lebanon
War
.

He
favored
prohibiting
foreign
aid
to
countries
that
had
recently
detonated
nuclear
weapons
:
aimed
squarely
at
India
,
but
also
affecting
Israel
should
it
conduct
a
nuclear
test
.

He
then
worked
to
support
the
supply
of
arms
to
the
United
States
'
Arab
allies
under
Carter
and
Reagan
,
until
his
views
on
Israel
shifted
significantly
in
0000
.

0000
presidential
election
Helms
supported
Ronald
Reagan
for
the
presidential
nomination
in
0000
,
even
before
Reagan
had
announced
his
candidacy
,
and
his
contribution
was
crucial
in
the
North
Carolina
primary
victory
that
paved
the
way
for
Reagan
's
presidential
election
in
0000
.

The
support
of
Helms
,
alongside
Raleigh-based
campaign
operative
Tom
Ellis
,
was
instrumental
in
Reagan
winning
the
North
Carolina
primary
and
later
presenting
a
major
challenge
to
incumbent
President
Gerald
Ford
at
the
0000
Republican
National
Convention
.

According
to
author
Craig
Shirley
,
the
two
men
deserve
credit
"
for
breathing
life
into
the
dying
Reagan
campaign
"
.

Going
into
the
primary
,
Reagan
had
lost
all
the
primaries
,
including
in
New
Hampshire
,
where
he
had
been
favored
,
and
was
two
million
dollars
in
debt
,
with
a
growing
number
of
Republican
leaders
calling
for
his
exit
.

The
Ford
campaign
was
predicting
a
victory
in
North
Carolina
,
but
assessed
Reagan
's
strength
in
the
state
simply
:
Helms
's
support
.

Whilst
Ford
had
the
backing
of
Governor
James
Holshouser
,
the
grassroots
movement
formed
in
North
Carolina
by
Ellis
and
backed
by
Helms
delivered
an
upset
victory
by
00
%
to
00
%
.

The
momentum
generated
in
North
Carolina
carried
Ronald
Reagan
to
landslide
primary
wins
in
Texas
,
California
,
and
other
critical
states
,
evening
the
contest
between
Reagan
and
Ford
,
and
thus
forcing
undeclared
delegates
to
choose
at
the
0000
convention
.

Later
,
Helms
was
not
pleased
by
the
announcement
that
Reagan
would
ask
the
0000
Republican
National
Convention
to
,
if
nominated
,
make
moderate
Pennsylvania
Senator
Richard
Schweiker
his
running
mate
for
the
general
election
,
but
kept
his
objections
to
himself
at
the
time
.

According
to
Helms
,
after
being
told
by
Ronald
Reagan
of
the
decision
,
he
noted
the
hour
because
,
"
I
wanted
to
record
for
posterity
the
exact
time
I
received
the
shock
of
my
life
.
"

Helms
and
Strom
Thurmond
tried
to
make
Reagan
drop
Schweiker
for
a
conservative
,
perhaps
either
James
Buckley
or
his
brother
William
F.
Buckley
,
and
rumors
surfaced
that
Helms
might
run
for
Vice
President
himself
,
but
Schweiker
remained
.

In
the
end
,
Reagan
lost
narrowly
to
Ford
,
whilst
Helms
received
only
token
support
at
the
Convention
for
the
Vice
Presidential
nomination
,
albeit
enough
to
place
him
second
,
far
behind
Ford
's
choice
of
Bob
Dole
.

Nonetheless
,
the
platform
adopted
was
a
broadly
conservative
one
,
and
the
conservative
faction
came
out
acting
like
the
winners
;
except
Jesse
Helms
.

Helms
vowed
to
campaign
actively
for
Ford
across
the
South
,
regarding
the
conservative
platform
adopted
at
the
Convention
to
be
a
"
mandate
"
on
which
Ford
was
pledging
to
run
.

However
,
he
did
target
Henry
Kissinger
,
demanding
that
he
embrace
the
platform
or
resign
immediately
,
after
Kissinger
issued
a
statement
calling
Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn
a
"
threat
to
world
peace
"
.

Helms
continued
to
back
Reagan
,
and
the
two
remained
close
friends
and
political
allies
,
although
not
uncritical
ones
,
throughout
Reagan
's
political
career
.

Despite
Reagan
's
defeat
at
the
convention
,
the
intervention
of
Helms
and
Ellis
arguably
led
to
the
most
important
conservative
primary
victory
in
the
history
of
the
Republican
Party
.

This
victory
enabled
Reagan
to
contest
the
0000
Republican
Presidential
nomination
,
and
later
to
win
the
next
nomination
at
the
0000
Republican
National
Convention
and
ultimately
the
Presidency
of
the
United
States
.

According
to
Craig
Shirley
,
Had
Reagan
lost
North
Carolina
,
despite
his
public
pronouncements
,
his
revolutionary
challenge
to
Ford
,
along
with
his
political
career
,
would
have
ended
unceremoniously
.

He
would
have
made
a
gracious
exit
speech
,
cut
a
deal
with
the
Ford
forces
to
eliminate
his
campaign
debt
,
made
a
minor
speech
at
the
Kansas
City
Convention
later
that
year
,
and
returned
to
his
ranch
in
Santa
Barbara
.

He
would
probably
have
only
reemerged
to
make
speeches
and
cut
radio
commercials
to
supplement
his
income
.

And
Reagan
would
have
faded
into
political
oblivion
.

Torrijos
–
Carter
Treaties
Helms
was
a
long-time
opponent
of
transferring
possession
of
the
Panama
Canal
to
Panama
,
calling
its
construction
an
"
historic
American
achievement
"
,
and
warned
that
it
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
Omar
Torrijos
's
"
communist
friends
"
.

It
had
appeared
as
an
issue
in
the
0000
presidential
race
,
wherein
then-President
Ford
suspended
negotiations
over
the
transfer
of
sovereignty
to
assuage
conservative
opposition
.

In
0000
,
President
Jimmy
Carter
reopened
negotiations
,
appointing
Sol
Linowitz
as
co-negotiator
without
Senate
confirmation
,
and
Helms
and
Strom
Thurmond
led
the
opposition
to
it
.

Helms
claimed
that
Linowitz
's
involvement
with
Marine
Midland
constituted
a
conflict
of
interests
,
arguing
that
it
constituted
a
bailout
of
American
banking
interests
,
and
brought
two
federal
suits
,
demanding
prior
congressional
approval
of
any
treaty
and
then
consent
by
both
houses
of
Congress
.

Helms
also
rallied
Reagan
,
telling
him
that
negotiation
over
Panama
would
be
a
"
second
Schweiker
"
as
far
as
his
conservative
base
was
concerned
.

When
Carter
announced
,
on
August
00
,
0000
,
the
conclusion
of
the
treaties
,
Helms
declared
it
a
constitutional
crisis
,
cited
the
need
for
the
support
of
America
's
allies
in
Latin
America
,
accused
the
U.S.
of
submitting
to
Panamanian
blackmail
,
and
complained
that
it
threatened
national
security
in
the
event
of
war
in
Europe
.

Helms
threatened
to
obstruct
Senate
business
,
proposing
two
hundred
amendments
to
the
revision
of
the
United
States
criminal
code
,
knowing
that
most
Americans
opposed
the
treaties
and
would
punish
congressmen
that
voted
for
them
if
the
ratification
vote
came
in
the
run-up
to
the
election
.

Helms
announced
the
results
of
an
opinion
poll
showing
00
%
public
opposition
,
but
Helms
and
Thurmond
's
leadership
of
the
cause
made
it
politically
easier
for
Carter
,
causing
them
to
be
replaced
by
the
soft-spoken
Paul
Laxalt
.

0000
re-election
campaign
Helms
began
campaigning
for
re-election
in
February
0000
,
allowing
him
to
campaign
actively
for
fifteen
months
by
the
time
of
the
primaries
.

Whilst
Helms
faced
no
primary
opponent
,
the
Democrats
nominated
Commissioner
of
Insurance
John
Ingram
,
who
came
from
behind
in
the
first
round
of
the
primary
to
win
in
the
run-off
.

Ingram
was
known
as
an
eccentric
populist
and
employed
low-budget
campaigning
,
just
as
he
had
to
win
in
the
primary
,
when
he
campaigned
almost
exclusively
on
the
issue
of
insurance
rates
and
against
"
fat
cats
and
special
interests
"
,
in
which
he
included
his
main
primary
opponent
.

Helms
was
one
of
three
senators
given
a
000
%
rating
by
the
conservative
Americans
for
Constitutional
Action
for
0000
,
and
was
ranked
fourth-most
conservative
by
others
.

The
Democratic
National
Committee
targeted
Helms
,
as
did
President
Carter
,
who
visited
North
Carolina
twice
on
Ingram
's
behalf
.

Over
the
long
campaign
,
Helms
raised
$
0.0
m
,
over
twice
as
much
as
the
second
most-expensive
nation-wide
(
John
Tower
's
in
Texas
)
,
thanks
to
Richard
Viguerie
and
Alex
Castellanos
's
pioneering
direct
mail
strategies
.

However
,
it
was
estimated
that
at
least
$
0m
of
Helms
's
spent
was
on
raising
the
funds
.

Nonetheless
,
Helms
easily
outspent
Ingram
,
who
spent
$
000,000
,
several
times
over
.

Helms
was
forced
to
suspend
campaigning
for
six
weeks
in
September
and
October
,
due
to
a
punctured
lumbar
disc
.

In
a
low-turnout
election
,
Helms
received
000,000
votes
(
00.0
%
)
to
Ingram
's
000,000
(
00.0
%
)
.

Celebrating
his
victory
,
Helms
told
his
supporters
that
it
was
a
"
victory
for
the
conservative
and
the
free
enterprise
cause
throughout
America
"
,
adding
,
"
I
'm
Senator
No
and
I
'm
glad
to
be
here
!
"

Second
Senate
term
(
0000
—
0000
)
New
Senate
term
On
January
0
,
0000
,
the
first
day
of
the
new
Congress
,
Helms
once
again
introduced
a
constitutional
amendment
outlawing
abortion
,
on
which
he
now
led
the
conservative
Senators
.

Senator
Helms
was
one
of
several
Republican
senators
who
in
0000
called
into
the
White
House
to
express
his
discontent
over
the
nomination
of
Sandra
Day
O'Connor
to
the
Supreme
Court
;
the
opposition
hinged
over
the
issue
of
O'Connor
's
presumed
unwillingness
to
overturn
Roe
v.
Wade
.

Helms
was
also
the
Senate
conservatives
'
leader
on
school
prayer
.

An
amendment
proposed
by
Helms
allowing
voluntary
prayer
was
passed
by
the
Senate
,
but
died
in
the
House
committee
.

To
that
act
,
Helms
also
proposed
an
amendment
banning
sex
education
without
written
parental
consent
.

In
0000
,
Helms
supported
,
along
with
Democrat
Patrick
Leahy
,
a
federal
Taxpayer
Bill
of
Rights
.

He
joined
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
being
one
of
four
Carter-critical
voices
new
to
the
committee
.

Leader
of
the
pro-
Taiwan
congressional
lobby
,
Helms
demanded
that
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
reject
the
use
of
force
against
the
Republic
of
China
,
but
,
much
to
his
shock
,
the
Carter
administration
did
not
ask
them
to
rule
it
out
.

Helms
also
criticized
the
government
over
Zimbabwe
Rhodesia
,
leading
support
for
the
Internal
Settlement
government
in
Zimbabwe
Rhodesia
,
under
Abel
Muzorewa
,
and
campaigned
along
with
Samuel
Hayakawa
for
the
immediate
lifting
of
sanctions
on
his
government
and
complaining
of
the
inconsistency
of
lifting
them
on
Uganda
immediately
after
Idi
Amin
's
departure
,
but
not
Zimbabwe
Rhodesia
after
Ian
Smith
's
.

Helms
hosted
Muzorewa
when
he
visited
Washington
and
met
with
Carter
in
July
0000
,
and
sent
two
aides
to
the
Lancaster
House
Conference
because
he
did
not
"
trust
the
State
Department
on
this
issue
"
,
thereby
provoking
British
diplomatic
complaints
.

One
of
the
aides
,
John
Carbaugh
,
was
accused
of
encouraging
Smith
to
"
hang
on
"
and
take
a
harder
line
and
implying
that
there
was
enough
support
in
the
Senate
to
lift
sanctions
without
a
settlement
.

Helms
introduced
legislation
that
demanded
immediate
lifting
of
the
sanctions
;
as
negotiations
progressed
,
Helms
complied
more
with
the
administration
's
line
,
although
Ted
Kennedy
accused
Carter
of
conceding
the
construction
of
a
new
aircraft
carrier
in
return
for
Helms
's
acquiescence
on
Zimbabwe
Rhodesia
,
which
both
parties
denied
.

Helms
's
support
for
lifting
sanctions
on
Zimbabwe
Rhodesia
may
have
been
grounded
in
North
Carolina
's
tobacco
traders
,
who
would
have
been
the
main
group
benefitting
from
unilaterally
lifting
sanctions
on
tobacco-exporting
Zimbabwe
Rhodesia
.

0000
presidential
election
In
0000
,
Helms
was
touted
as
a
potential
contender
for
the
Republican
nomination
for
the
0000
presidential
election
,
but
had
poor
voter
recognition
,
and
he
lagged
far
behind
the
front-runners
.

He
was
the
only
candidate
to
file
for
the
New
Hampshire
Vice-Presidential
primary
.

Going
into
0000
,
he
was
suggested
as
a
potential
running
mate
for
Reagan
,
and
he
said
he
'd
accept
if
he
could
"
be
his
own
man
"
,
and
was
one
of
three
conservative
candidates
running
for
the
nomination
.

However
,
his
ideological
agreement
with
Reagan
risked
losing
moderates
'
votes
,
particularly
due
to
the
independent
candidacy
of
John
B.
Anderson
,
and
the
Reagan
camp
was
split
:
eventually
designating
George
H.
W.
Bush
as
his
preferred
candidate
.

At
the
convention
,
Helms
toyed
with
the
idea
of
running
for
Vice-President
despite
Reagan
's
choice
,
but
let
it
go
in
exchange
for
Bush
endorsing
the
party
platform
and
an
address
to
the
convention
.

As
expected
,
Helms
was
drafted
by
conservatives
anyway
,
and
won
00
votes
,
coming
second
.

Helms
was
the
"
spiritual
leader
of
the
conservative
convention
"
,
and
led
the
movement
that
successfully
reversed
the
Republican
Party
's
00-year
platform
support
for
an
Equal
Rights
Amendment
.

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
Helms
proposed
another
bill
denying
the
Supreme
Court
jurisdiction
over
school
prayer
,
but
this
found
little
support
in
committee
,
under
the
weight
of
opposition
from
mainline
Protestant
churches
,
and
its
counterpart
was
defeated
in
the
House
.

Senators
Helms
and
James
A.
McClure
blocked
Ted
Kennedy
's
comprehensive
criminal
code
that
did
not
relax
federal
firearms
restrictions
,
inserted
capital
punishment
procedures
,
and
reinstated
current
statutory
law
on
pornography
,
prostitution
,
and
drug
possession
.

Following
from
his
success
at
reintroducing
gold-indexed
contracts
in
0000
,
in
October
0000
,
Helms
proposed
a
return
to
the
gold
standard
,
and
successfully
passed
an
amendment
setting
up
a
commission
to
look
into
gold-backed
currency
.

After
the
presidential
election
,
Helms
and
Strom
Thurmond
sponsored
a
Senate
amendment
to
a
Department
of
Justice
appropriations
bill
denying
the
department
the
power
to
participate
in
busing
,
due
to
objections
over
federal
involvement
,
but
,
although
passed
by
Congress
,
was
vetoed
by
a
lame
duck
Carter
.

Helms
pledged
to
introduce
an
even
stronger
anti-busing
bill
as
soon
as
Reagan
took
office
.

Republicans
take
the
Senate
In
the
0000
Senate
election
,
the
Republicans
unexpectedly
won
a
majority
,
their
first
in
twenty-six
years
,
including
John
Porter
East
,
a
social
conservative
and
a
Helms
protégé
soon
dubbed
"
Helms
on
Wheels
"
,
winning
the
other
North
Carolina
seat
.

Howard
Baker
was
set
to
become
Majority
Leader
,
but
conservatives
,
angered
by
Baker
's
support
for
the
Panama
treaty
,
SALT
II
,
and
the
Equal
Rights
Amendment
,
had
sought
to
replace
him
with
Helms
until
Reagan
gave
Baker
his
backing
.

Although
,
it
was
thought
they
'd
put
Helms
in
charge
of
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
instead
of
the
liberal
Charles
H.
Percy
,
he
instead
became
chairman
of
the
Senate
Agriculture
,
Nutrition
and
Forestry
Committee
in
the
new
Congress
.

The
first
six
months
of
0000
were
consumed
by
numerous
Foreign
Relations
Committee
confirmation
hearings
,
which
were
held
up
by
Helms
,
who
believed
many
of
the
appointees
too
liberal
or
too
tainted
by
association
with
Kissinger
,
and
not
dedicated
enough
to
his
definition
of
the
"
Reagan
program
"
:
support
for
South
Africa
,
Taiwan
,
and
Latin
American
right-wing
regimes
(
as
opposed
to
Black
Africa
and
"
Red
"
China
)
,
and
active
defense
of
human
rights
.

These
nominations
included
Alexander
Haig
,
Chester
Crocker
,
John
Louis
,
and
Lawrence
Eagleburger
,
all
of
whom
were
confirmed
regardless
,
whilst
all
of
Helms
's
candidates
,
were
rejected
.

Helms
also
,
unsuccessfully
,
opposed
the
nominations
of
Caspar
Weinberger
,
Donald
Regan
,
and
Frank
Carlucci
.

However
,
he
did
score
a
notable
coup
two
years
later
,
when
he
led
a
small
group
of
conservatives
to
block
the
nomination
of
Robert
T.
Grey
for
nine
months
,
and
thus
causing
the
firing
of
Eugene
Rostow
.

Food
stamp
program
An
opponent
of
the
Food
Stamp
Program
,
Helms
had
already
voted
to
reduce
its
scope
,
and
was
determined
to
follow
this
through
as
Agriculture
Committee
chairman
.

At
one
point
,
he
proposed
a
00
%
cut
in
their
funding
.

Instead
,
Helms
supported
the
replacement
of
food
stamps
with
workfare
.

He
then
proposed
that
food
stamp
benefits
be
dropped
by
$
00.00
per
month
per
child
for
each
youngster
enrolled
in
the
school
lunch
program
.

He
maintained
that
"
free
lunches
"
duplicate
food
stamps
.

The
outcry
against
his
proposal
was
so
strong
that
he
was
compelled
to
back
down
.

Helms
also
challenged
fraud
in
the
food
stamp
program
.

He
said
that
the
public
had
"
grown
legitimately
resentful
about
the
abuses
which
they
themselves
have
observed
"
.

As
a
freshman
lawmaker
in
0000
,
Helms
tried
to
reverse
the
0000
congressional
vote
which
had
permitted
workers
on
strike
to
qualify
for
food
stamps
.

Though
he
failed
to
gain
reversal
,
his
position
drew
the
support
of
future
Minority
and
Majority
Leader
Howard
Baker
of
Tennessee
and
twelve
Senate
Democrats
.

Helms
'
position
was
upheld
in
0000
,
when
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
decreed
0
–
0
that
a
law
denying
food
stamps
to
strikers
was
constitutional
unless
the
worker
otherwise
qualified
for
food
stamps
prior
to
going
on
strike
.

Justice
Byron
White
said
that
the
government
must
maintain
neutrality
in
labor
dispute
and
not
subsidize
strikers
.

As
the
Agriculture
Committee
chairman
,
Helms
proposed
repeal
of
the
0000
amendment
which
had
deleted
the
purchase
requirement
for
food
stamps
.

With
that
position
he
ran
afoul
of
fellow
Republican
Bob
Dole
,
who
claimed
that
the
purchase
requirement
had
contributed
to
fraud
and
administrative
difficulties
in
the
program
.

Helms
cited
a
Congressional
Budget
Office
report
which
showed
that
00
percent
of
the
increase
in
stamp
usage
had
occurred
since
the
purchase
requirement
was
dropped
.

When
Helms
'
ally
,
Steve
Symms
of
Idaho
,
proposed
to
reinstitute
the
purchase
requirement
,
the
motion
was
defeated
,
00
–
00
.

The
Helms
bloc
also
failed
to
secure
other
limits
to
the
program
,
including
a
motion
to
delete
alcohol
and
drug
residential
treatment
patients
from
benefits
.

House
and
Senate
conferees
dropped
a
Helms-backed
provision
requiring
families
disqualified
from
the
program
to
repay
double
the
amount
of
any
benefits
received
improperly
.

House
Democratic
Whip
Thomas
Foley
of
Washington
insisted
that
such
a
penalty
would
violate
the
Fifth
Amendment
rights
to
due
process
.

Instead
families
repay
the
actual
amount
of
improperly
obtained
benefits
.

Economic
policies
Helms
supported
the
gold
standard
through
his
role
as
the
Agriculture
Committee
chairman
,
which
exercises
wide
powers
over
commodity
markets
.

During
the
budget
crisis
of
0000
,
Helms
restored
$
000
million
for
school
lunches
by
instead
cutting
foreign
aid
,
and
against
increases
in
grain
and
milk
price
support
,
despite
the
importance
of
the
dairy
industry
to
North
Carolina
.

He
warned
repeatedly
against
costly
farm
subsidies
as
chairman
.

However
,
in
0000
,
he
used
his
position
to
lobby
to
use
the
country
's
strategic
dairy
and
wheat
stocks
to
subsidize
food
exports
as
part
of
a
trade
war
with
the
European
Union
.

Helms
heavily
opposed
cutting
food
aid
to
Poland
after
martial
law
was
declared
,
and
called
for
the
end
of
grain
exports
to
(
and
arms
limitation
talks
with
)
the
Soviet
Union
instead
.

In
0000
,
Helms
authored
a
bill
to
introduce
a
federal
flat
tax
of
00
%
with
a
personal
allowance
of
$
0,000
.

He
voted
against
the
0000
budget
:
the
only
conservative
Senator
to
have
done
so
,
and
was
a
leading
voice
for
a
balanced
budget
amendment
.

With
Charlie
Rose
,
he
proposed
a
bill
that
would
limit
tobacco
price
supports
,
but
would
allow
the
transfer
of
subsidy
credits
from
non-farmers
to
farmers
.

He
co-sponsored
the
bi-partisan
move
in
0000
to
extend
drug
patent
duration
.

Helms
continued
to
pose
obstacles
to
Reagan
's
budget
plans
.

At
the
end
of
the
00th
Congress
,
Helms
led
a
filibuster
against
Reagan
's
increase
of
federal
gasoline
tax
by
0-cents
per
gallon
:
mirroring
his
opposition
to
Governor
Jim
Hunt
's
0-cent
increase
in
the
North
Carolina
gasoline
tax
,
but
alienating
the
White
House
from
Helms
.

Social
issues
Although
Helms
recognized
budget
concerns
and
nominations
as
predominant
,
he
rejected
calls
by
Baker
to
move
debate
on
social
issues
to
0000
,
with
conservatives
seeking
to
discuss
abortion
,
school
prayer
,
the
minimum
wage
,
and
the
"
fair
housing
"
policy
.

With
the
new
Congress
,
Helms
and
Robert
K.
Dornan
again
proposed
an
amendment
banning
abortion
in
all
circumstances
,
and
also
proposed
a
bill
defining
fetuses
as
human
beings
,
thereby
taking
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
federal
courts
,
along
with
Henry
Hyde
and
Romano
Mazzoli
.

More
successfully
,
Helms
passed
an
amendment
banning
federal
funds
from
being
used
for
abortion
unless
the
woman
's
life
is
in
danger
.

His
support
was
key
to
the
nomination
of
C.
Everett
Koop
as
Surgeon
General
,
by
proposing
lifting
the
age
limit
that
would
otherwise
have
ruled
out
Koop
.

He
proposed
an
amendment
taking
school
prayer
out
of
the
remit
of
the
Supreme
Court
,
which
was
criticized
for
being
unconstitutional
;
despite
Reagan
's
endorsement
,
the
bill
was
eventually
rejected
,
after
twenty
months
of
dispute
and
numerous
filibusters
,
in
September
0000
,
by
00
–
00
.

Helms
and
Strom
Thurmond
sponsored
another
amendment
to
prevent
the
Department
of
Justice
filing
suits
in
defence
of
federal
busing
,
which
he
contended
wasted
taxpayer
money
without
improving
education
;
this
was
filibustered
by
Lowell
Weicker
for
eight
months
,
but
passed
in
March
0000
.

In
0000
,
Helms
started
secret
negotiations
to
end
an
00-year
impasse
and
pave
the
way
for
desegregation
of
historically
white
and
historically
black
colleges
in
North
Carolina
.

In
response
to
a
rival
anti-discrimination
bill
in
0000
,
he
proposed
a
bill
outlawing
granting
tax-free
status
to
schools
that
discriminated
racially
,
but
allowing
schools
that
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
religion
to
avoid
taxes
.

When
the
Voting
Rights
Act
came
up
for
amendment
in
0000
,
Helms
and
Thurmond
criticized
it
for
bias
against
the
South
,
arguing
that
it
made
Carolinians
"
second-class
citizens
"
by
treating
their
states
differently
,
and
proposed
an
amendment
that
extended
its
terms
to
the
whole
country
,
which
they
knew
would
bury
it
.

However
,
it
was
extended
anyway
,
despite
Helms
's
filibuster
,
which
he
promised
to
lead
"
until
the
cows
come
home
"
.

In
0000
,
Helms
hired
Claude
Allen
,
an
African
American
,
as
his
press
secretary
.

Despite
his
publicly
aired
belief
that
he
was
one
of
the
best-liked
senators
amongst
black
staff
in
Congress
,
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
did
not
have
any
African-American
staff
of
his
own
,
prompting
the
hiring
of
the
twenty-two-year-old
,
who
had
switched
parties
when
he
was
press
secretary
to
Bill
Cobey
in
the
previous
year
's
campaign
.

With
John
East
and
John
Stennis
,
Helms
led
the
senatorial
opposition
to
establishing
Martin
Luther
King
Day
as
a
federal
holiday
in
0000
,
attributing
his
opposition
to
two
associates
of
King
's
with
communist
ties
:
Stanley
Levison
and
Jack
O'Dell
.

They
embarked
on
a
00-day
filibuster
,
which
Helms
broke
in
exchange
for
a
new
tobacco
bill
.

However
,
he
then
demanded
that
FBI
surveillance
tapes
allegedly
detailing
philandering
on
King
's
part
be
released
,
although
Reagan
and
the
courts
refused
.

The
conservatives
attempted
to
rename
the
day
"
National
Equality
Day
"
or
"
National
Civil
Rights
Day
"
,
but
failed
,
and
the
bill
was
passed
.

Writing
in
the
Washington
Post
several
years
later
,
David
Broder
attributed
Helms
opposition
to
the
MLK
holiday
to
racism
on
Helms
's
part
.

Latin
America
Upon
the
Republican
takeover
of
the
Senate
,
Helms
also
became
chairman
of
the
Subcommittee
on
Western
Hemisphere
Affairs
,
promising
to
"
review
all
our
policies
on
Latin
America
"
,
of
which
he
had
been
severely
critical
under
Carter
.

He
immediately
focused
on
the
escalating
civil
war
in
El
Salvador
,
and
particularly
preventing
Nicaragua
n
and
Cuba
n
support
for
guerrilla
s
in
El
Salvador
.

Within
hours
,
the
subcommittee
approved
military
aid
to
El
Salvador
,
and
later
led
the
push
to
cut
aid
to
Nicaragua
.

Helms
was
assisted
in
pursuing
the
foreign
policy
realignment
by
John
Carbaugh
,
whose
influence
the
New
York
Times
said
"
[
rivalled
]
many
of
[
the
Senate
's
]
more
visible
elected
members
"
.

In
El
Salvador
,
Helms
had
close
ties
with
the
right-wing
Salvadoran
Nationalist
Republican
Alliance
and
its
leader
and
death
squad
founder
Roberto
D'Aubuisson
.

Helms
said
,
"
If
I
had
found
even
one
credible
link
between
D'Aubuisson
and
the
so-called
'
death
squads
'
...
I
'd
repudiate
him
instantly
.
"

Helms
opposed
the
appointment
of
Thomas
R.
Pickering
as
Ambassador
to
El
Salvador
.

alleged
that
the
CIA
had
interfered
in
the
Salvadoran
election
March
and
May
0000
,
in
favor
of
the
incumbent
centre-left
José
Napoleón
Duarte
instead
of
D'Aubuisson
,
claiming
that
Pickering
had
"
used
the
cloak
of
diplomacy
to
strangle
freedom
in
the
night
"
.

A
CIA
operative
testifying
to
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
was
alleged
by
Helms
to
have
admitted
rigging
the
election
,
but
senators
that
attended
have
stated
that
,
whilst
the
CIA
operative
admitted
involvement
,
they
did
not
make
such
an
admission
.

Helms
disclosed
details
of
CIA
financial
support
for
Duarte
,
earning
a
rebuke
from
Barry
Goldwater
,
but
Helms
replied
that
his
information
came
from
sources
in
El
Salvador
,
not
the
Senate
committee
.

In
0000
,
Helms
was
the
only
senator
who
opposed
a
Senate
resolution
endorsing
a
pro-British
policy
during
the
Falklands
War
,
citing
the
Monroe
doctrine
,
although
he
did
manage
to
weaken
the
resolution
's
language
.

Nonetheless
,
Helms
was
a
supporter
of
the
late
Chile
an
President
Augusto
Pinochet
,
who
supported
the
United
Kingdom
in
the
Falklands
conflict
.

Helms
was
steadfastly
opposed
to
the
Castro
regime
in
Cuba
,
and
spent
much
of
his
time
campaigning
against
the
lifting
of
sanctions
.

In
0000
,
he
opposed
a
treaty
with
Cuba
on
sea
boundary
delimitation
unless
it
included
withdrawal
of
the
Soviet
brigade
stationed
on
the
island
.

The
following
year
,
he
proposed
legislation
establishing
Radio
Free
Cuba
,
which
would
later
become
known
as
Radio
Martí
.

0000
re-election
campaign
Halfway
through
Reagan
's
term
,
Helms
was
talked
about
as
a
prospective
presidential
candidate
in
0000
in
case
Reagan
chose
to
stand
down
after
his
first
time
.

There
was
also
speculation
that
Helms
would
run
for
the
Governorship
,
being
vacated
by
Jim
Hunt
.

However
,
the
President
stood
for
re-election
,
and
Helms
ran
once
more
for
his
Senate
seat
—
facing
Governor
Hunt
—
and
becoming
the
top
target
amongst
the
incumbent
Senate
Republicans
.

Unlike
in
0000
,
Helms
faced
an
opponent
in
the
primary
,
George
Wimbish
,
but
won
with
00.0
%
of
the
vote
,
while
Hunt
received
00
%
in
his
.

During
the
general
election
campaign
,
Hunt
accused
Helms
of
having
the
most
"
anti-Israel
record
of
any
member
of
the
U.S.
Senate
"
.

Helms
pledged
during
the
campaign
that
he
would
retain
his
chairmanship
of
the
Agriculture
committee
.

In
the
most
expensive
Senate
campaign
up
to
that
time
,
Helms
narrowly
defeated
Hunt
,
taking
0,000,000
(
00.0
%
)
to
Hunt
's
0,000,000
(
00.0
%
)
.

Helms
might
not
have
won
had
it
not
been
for
Ronald
Reagan
's
popularity
in
the
state
;
Reagan
carried
North
Carolina
by
00
points
that
year
.

Third
Senate
term
(
0000
—
0000
)
In
0000
,
Helms
hired
James
Meredith
,
most
famous
as
the
first
African
American
ever
admitted
to
the
University
of
Mississippi
,
as
a
domestic
policy
adviser
to
his
Senate
office
staff
.

Meredith
noted
that
Helms
was
the
only
member
of
the
Senate
to
respond
to
his
offer
.

In
0000
,
Helms
successfully
lobbied
for
an
amendment
to
the
Americans
with
Disabilities
Act
,
legislation
protecting
disability
rights
that
exempted
pedophilia
,
schizophrenia
,
and
kleptomania
from
the
conditions
against
which
discrimination
was
barred
.

Even
though
the
Helms
amendment
was
kept
in
the
final
ADA
bill
that
passed
Congress
in
0000
,
Helms
twice
voted
against
the
bill
.

Foreign
policy
Although
Helms
was
returned
to
office
,
and
became
the
senior
Republican
on
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
the
moderate
Richard
Lugar
of
Indiana
became
its
chair
,
after
Helms
and
Lugar
cut
a
deal
to
keep
liberals
out
of
top
committee
posts
.

Despite
pressure
to
claim
the
Foreign
Relations
chair
,
Helms
kept
the
Agriculture
chair
,
as
he
had
pledged
in
his
campaign
.

A
"
purge
"
of
the
State
Department
by
George
P.
Shultz
in
early
0000
,
replacing
conservatives
with
moderates
,
was
heavily
opposed
by
the
Helms-led
conservatives
.

They
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
block
the
appointment
of
Rozanne
L.
Ridgway
,
Richard
Burt
,
and
Edwin
G.
Corr
as
ambassadors
,
arguing
that
Shultz
was
appointing
diplomats
that
were
not
loyal
to
President
Reagan
's
philosophy
,
particularly
in
Latin
America
.

In
August
,
Helms
threatened
to
lead
a
filibuster
against
a
bill
imposing
sanctions
on
South
Africa
,
delaying
it
until
after
summer
recess
.

In
early
0000
,
Panamanian
dissident
Winston
Spadafora
visited
Helms
and
requested
that
the
Subcommittee
on
Western
Hemisphere
Affairs
hold
hearings
on
Panama
.

Ignoring
Elliott
Abrams
's
request
for
a
softer
line
towards
Panama
,
Helms
—
a
long-time
critic
of
Noriega
—
agreed
,
and
the
hearings
uncovered
the
large
degree
of
leeway
that
the
U.S.
government
,
and
particularly
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
,
had
been
giving
to
Noriega
.

After
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
encountered
opposition
from
Oliver
North
in
investigating
Noriega
's
role
in
drugs
trafficking
,
Helms
teamed
up
with
John
Kerry
to
introduce
an
amendment
to
the
Intelligence
Authorization
Act
demanding
that
the
CIA
investigate
the
Panama
Defense
Forces
'
potential
involvement
.

In
0000
,
after
Noriega
was
indicted
on
charges
including
drugs
trafficking
,
a
former
Panamanian
consul
general
and
chief
of
political
intelligence
testified
to
the
subcommittee
,
detailing
Panama
's
compiling
of
evidence
on
its
political
opponents
in
the
United
States
,
including
Senators
Helms
and
Ted
Kennedy
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
CIA
and
National
Security
Council
.

Helms
proposed
that
the
government
suspend
the
Carter-Torrijos
treaties
unless
Noriega
were
extradited
within
thirty
days
.

Helms
became
interested
in
the
Vietnam
War
POW/MIA
issue
,
and
in
October
0000
his
committee
staff
chief
and
longest-serving
aide
,
James
P.
Lucier
,
prepared
a
report
stating
that
it
was
probable
there
were
live
American
prisoners
still
being
held
in
Vietnam
and
that
the
George
H.
W.
Bush
administration
was
complicit
in
hiding
the
facts
.

The
report
also
alleged
that
the
Soviet
Union
had
held
American
prisoners
after
the
end
of
World
War
II
and
more
may
have
been
transferred
there
during
the
Korean
War
and
during
the
Vietnam
War
.

(
Lucier
also
believed
that
survivors
of
the
0000
shoot-down
of
Korean
Air
Lines
Flight
000
were
being
held
prisoner
by
the
Soviets
.
)

Helms
stated
that
the
"
deeper
story
"
was
a
possible
"
deliberate
effort
by
certain
people
in
the
government
to
disregard
all
information
or
reports
about
living
MIA-POWs
"
.

This
was
followed
up
in
May
0000
by
a
minority
report
of
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
released
by
Helms
and
titled
An
Examination
of
US
Policy
Toward
POW/MIAs
,
which
made
similar
claims
and
concluded
that
"
any
evidence
that
suggested
an
MIA
might
be
alive
was
uniformly
and
arbitrarily
rejected
...
"
The
issuing
of
the
report
caused
other
Republicans
on
the
committee
to
become
angry
,
and
charges
were
made
that
the
report
contained
errors
,
innuendo
,
and
unsubstantiated
rumors
.

This
and
other
personnel
matters
led
to
Helms
firing
Lucier
and
eight
other
staff
members
in
January
0000
.

Helms
subsequently
distanced
himself
from
the
POW/MIA
issue
.

(
The
aides
claimed
vindication
later
in
0000
when
Russian
President
Boris
Yeltsin
said
that
the
Soviet
Union
had
kept
some
U.S.
prisoners
in
the
early
0000s
.
)

HIV
legislation
In
0000
,
Helms
added
an
amendment
to
the
Supplemental
Appropriations
Act
,
which
directed
the
president
to
use
executive
authority
to
add
HIV
infection
to
the
list
of
excludable
diseases
which
prevent
both
travel
and
immigration
to
the
United
States
.

The
action
was
opposed
by
the
U.S.
Public
Health
Service
.

Congress
restored
the
executive
authority
to
remove
HIV
from
the
list
of
excludable
conditions
in
the
0000
Immigration
Reform
Act
,
and
in
January
0000
,
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
Louis
Sullivan
announced
he
would
delete
HIV
from
the
list
of
excludable
conditions
.

A
letter-writing
campaign
headed
by
Helms
ultimately
convinced
President
Bush
not
to
lift
the
ban
,
and
left
the
United
States
the
only
industrialized
nation
in
the
world
to
prohibit
travel
based
on
HIV
status
.

The
travel
ban
was
also
responsible
for
the
cancellation
of
the
0000
International
AIDS
Conference
in
Boston
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
the
00-year-old
ban
was
lifted
after
having
been
signed
by
President
Barack
Obama
on
October
00
,
0000
.

The
New
York
Times
stated
that
Helms
was
"
bitterly
opposed
to
federal
financing
of
AIDS
research
and
treatment
"
,
which
he
believed
was
God
's
punishment
for
homosexuals
.

Opposing
the
Kennedy-Hatch
AIDS
bill
in
0000
,
Helms
stated
,
"
There
is
not
one
single
case
of
AIDS
in
this
country
that
can
not
be
traced
in
origin
to
sodomy
"
.

When
Ryan
White
died
in
0000
,
his
mother
went
to
Congress
to
speak
to
politicians
on
behalf
of
people
with
AIDS
.

She
spoke
to
00
representatives
;
Helms
refused
to
speak
to
Jeanne
White
,
even
when
she
was
alone
with
him
in
an
elevator
.

Despite
opposition
by
Helms
,
the
Ryan
White
Care
Act
passed
in
0000
.

0000
reelection
campaign
Helms
ran
for
reelection
in
a
nationally
publicized
and
rancorous
campaign
against
the
former
mayor
of
Charlotte
,
Harvey
Gantt
,
in
his
"
bid
to
become
the
nation
's
only
black
Senator
"
and
"
the
first
black
elected
to
the
Senate
from
the
South
since
Reconstruction
"
.

In
the
primary
,
Helms
had
two
opponents
,
George
Wimbish
(
as
in
0000
)
and
another
;
Helms
won
with
00.0
%
of
the
vote
.

Helms
aired
a
late-running
television
commercial
that
showed
a
white
man
's
hands
ripping
up
a
rejection
notice
from
a
company
that
gave
the
job
to
a
"
less
qualified
minority
"
;
some
critics
claimed
the
ad
utilized
sub-textual
racist
themes
.

The
advertisement
was
produced
by
Alex
Castellanos
,
whom
Helms
would
employ
until
his
company
was
dropped
in
April
0000
after
running
an
unusually
hard-hitting
ad
.

Helms
won
the
election
with
0,000,000
votes
(
00.0
percent
)
to
Gantt
's
000,000
(
00.0
percent
)
.

In
his
victory
statement
,
Helms
noted
the
unhappiness
of
some
media
outlets
over
his
victory
,
quoting
a
line
from
Casey
at
the
Bat
:
"
There
's
no
joy
in
Mudville
tonight
.

The
mighty
ultra-liberal
establishment
,
and
the
liberal
politicians
and
editors
and
commentators
and
columnists
have
struck
out
.
"

Fourth
Senate
term
(
0000
—
0000
)
In
the
early
0000s
,
Helms
was
a
vocal
opponent
of
the
North
American
Free
Trade
Agreement
(
NAFTA
)
.

Remarks
re
Moseley
Braun
and
Clinton
In
a
widely
publicized
incident
on
July
00
,
0000
,
Carol
Moseley
Braun
,
the
first
black
woman
in
the
Senate
and
the
only
black
Senator
at
the
time
,
alleged
that
Helms
offended
her
by
whistling
"
Dixie
"
.

After
Moseley
Braun
persuaded
the
Senate
to
vote
against
Helms
's
amendment
to
extend
the
patent
of
the
United
Daughters
of
the
Confederacy
insignia
,
which
included
the
Confederate
flag
,
Helms
ran
into
Moseley
Braun
in
an
elevator
.

Helms
turned
to
Senator
Orrin
Hatch
and
said
,
"
Watch
me
make
her
cry
.

I
'm
going
to
make
her
cry
.

I
'm
going
to
sing
'
Dixie
'
until
she
cries
.
"

He
then
proceeded
to
sing
the
song
about
"
the
good
life
"
during
slavery
to
Moseley
Braun
.

In
0000
,
Helms
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
block
Moseley
Braun
's
nomination
to
be
United
States
Ambassador
to
New
Zealand
.

In
0000
,
Helms
created
a
sensation
when
he
told
broadcasters
Rowland
Evans
and
Robert
Novak
that
Clinton
was
"
not
up
"
to
the
tasks
of
being
commander-in-chief
,
and
suggested
two
days
later
,
on
the
anniversary
of
John
F.
Kennedy
's
assassination
,
that
Clinton
"
better
not
show
up
around
here
[
Fort
Bragg
]
without
a
bodyguard
"
.

Helms
said
Clinton
was
so
unpopular
and
said
he
had
not
meant
it
as
a
threat
.

Republican
majority
Republicans
regained
control
of
Congress
after
the
0000
elections
and
Helms
finally
became
the
chairman
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
.

He
was
the
first
North
Carolinian
to
chair
the
committee
since
Nathaniel
Macon
,
a
descendant
of
Martha
Washington
,
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
00th
century
.

In
that
role
,
Helms
pushed
for
reform
of
the
UN
and
blocked
payment
of
the
United
States
'
dues
.

Helms
secured
sufficient
reforms
that
a
colleague
,
future
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
of
Delaware
said
that
"
As
only
Nixon
could
go
to
China
,
only
Helms
could
fix
the
U.N.
"
Helms
passed
few
laws
of
his
own
in
part
because
of
this
bridge-burning
style
.

Hedrick
Smith
's
The
Power
Game
depicts
several
senators
specifically
blocking
Helms
's
goals
as
a
result
of
his
intransigence
,
but
nonetheless
portrays
Helms
as
a
"
devastatingly
effective
power
broker
"
.

Helms
vehemently
opposed
granting
most
favored
nation
status
to
China
,
citing
human
rights
concerns
.

Helms
tried
to
block
the
refunding
of
the
Ryan
White
Care
Act
in
0000
,
saying
that
those
with
AIDS
were
responsible
for
the
disease
,
because
they
had
contracted
it
because
of
their
"
deliberate
,
disgusting
,
revolting
conduct
"
,
and
that
the
reason
AIDS
existed
in
the
first
place
was
because
it
was
"
God
's
punishment
for
homosexuals
"
.

Helms
also
claimed
that
more
federal
dollars
were
spent
on
AIDS
than
heart
disease
or
cancer
,
despite
this
not
being
borne
out
by
the
Public
Health
Service
statistics
.

Helms
—
Burton
Act
Soon
after
becoming
the
chair
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
in
February
0000
,
Helms
announced
that
he
wished
to
strengthen
the
spirit
of
the
0000
Torricelli
Act
with
new
legislation
.

Its
companion
sponsored
through
the
House
by
Dan
Burton
of
Indiana
,
it
would
strengthen
the
embargo
against
Cuba
:
further
codifying
the
embargo
,
instructing
United
States
diplomats
to
vote
in
favor
of
sanctions
on
Cuba
,
stripping
the
President
of
the
option
of
ending
the
embargo
by
executive
order
until
Fidel
and
Raúl
Castro
leave
power
and
a
prescribed
course
of
transition
is
followed
.

The
bill
also
,
controversially
explicitly
overruling
the
Act
of
State
Doctrine
,
allowed
foreign
companies
to
be
sued
in
American
courts
if
,
in
dealings
with
the
regime
of
Fidel
Castro
,
they
acquired
assets
formerly
owned
by
Americans
.

Passing
the
House
comfortably
,
the
Senate
was
far
more
cautious
,
under
pressure
from
the
Clinton
administration
.

The
debate
was
filibuster
ed
,
with
a
motion
of
cloture
falling
four
votes
short
.

Helms
reintroduced
the
bill
without
Titles
III
and
IV
,
which
detailed
the
penalties
on
investors
,
and
it
passed
by
00
to
00
on
October
00
,
0000
.

A
conference
committee
was
scheduled
to
convene
,
but
did
not
until
February
00
,
0000
,
by
which
time
external
events
had
taken
over
.

On
00
February
,
Cuba
shot
down
two
small
Brothers
to
the
Rescue
planes
piloted
by
anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans
.

When
the
conference
committee
met
,
the
tougher
House
version
,
with
all
four
titles
,
won
out
on
most
substantive
points
.

It
was
passed
by
the
Senate
00
–
00
and
the
House
000
–
00
,
and
President
Clinton
signed
the
Helms-Burton
Act
into
law
on
March
00
,
0000
.

For
years
after
its
passing
,
Helms
criticized
the
corporate
interests
that
sought
to
lift
the
sanctions
on
Cuba
,
writing
an
article
in
0000
for
Foreign
Affairs
,
at
whose
publisher
,
the
Council
on
Foreign
Relations
,
also
drew
Helms
's
ire
for
its
softer
approach
to
Cuba
.

0000
reelection
campaign
In
0000
,
Helms
drew
0,000,000
(
00.0
percent
)
to
Gantt
's
0,000,000
(
00.0
percent
)
.

Helms
supported
his
former
Senate
colleague
Bob
Dole
for
president
,
while
Gantt
endorsed
Bill
Clinton
.

Although
Helms
is
generally
credited
with
being
the
most
successful
Republican
politician
in
North
Carolina
history
,
his
largest
proportion
of
the
vote
in
any
of
his
five
elections
was
00.0
percent
.

In
North
Carolina
,
Helms
was
a
polarizing
figure
,
and
he
freely
admitted
that
many
people
in
the
state
strongly
disliked
him
:
"
[
The
Democrats
]
could
nominate
Mortimer
Snerd
and
he
'd
automatically
get
00
percent
of
the
vote
.
"

Helms
was
particularly
popular
among
older
,
conservative
constituents
,
and
was
considered
one
of
the
last
"
Old
South
"
politicians
to
have
served
in
the
Senate
.

However
,
he
also
considered
himself
a
voice
of
conservative
youth
,
whom
he
hailed
in
the
dedication
of
his
autobiography
.

Under
Helms
's
banner
,
many
conservative
Democrats
in
eastern
North
Carolina
switched
parties
and
began
to
vote
increasingly
Republican
.

Fifth
Senate
term
(
0000
—
0000
)
The
summer
of
0000
saw
Helms
engage
in
a
protracted
,
high-profile
battle
to
block
the
nomination
of
William
Weld
,
Republican
Governor
of
Massachusetts
,
as
Ambassador
to
Mexico
:
refusing
to
hold
a
committee
meeting
to
schedule
a
confirmation
hearing
.

Although
he
did
not
make
a
formal
statement
of
his
reason
,
Helms
did
criticize
Weld
's
support
for
medical
marijuana
,
which
Senate
conservatives
saw
as
incompatible
with
Mexico
's
key
role
in
the
War
on
Drugs
.

Weld
attacked
Helms
's
politics
,
saying
,
"
I
am
not
Senator
Helms
's
kind
of
Republican
.

I
do
not
pass
his
litmus
test
on
social
policy
.

Nor
do
I
want
to
.
"

This
opened
Helms
to
counter
on
Weld
's
positions
on
abortion
,
gay
rights
,
and
other
issues
on
which
he
had
a
liberal
position
.

Other
factors
,
such
as
Weld
's
noncommittal
position
on
Helms
's
chairmanship
during
his
0000
Senate
campaign
and
Weld
's
wife
's
donation
to
the
Gantt
campaign
,
made
the
nomination
personal
and
less
cooperative
.

Held
up
in
the
committee
by
Helms
,
despite
Weld
resigning
his
governorship
to
concentrate
on
the
nomination
and
a
petition
signed
by
most
senators
,
his
nomination
died
.

As
Chair
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
Jesse
Helms
vigorously
opposed
American
participation
in
the
International
Criminal
Court
.

While
the
United
States
cast
one
of
four
votes
against
the
Rome
Statute
of
the
International
Criminal
Court
,
adopted
by
a
000
to
0
vote
in
July
0000
,
President
Clinton
signed
the
Statute
for
the
United
States
.

However
,
Helms
was
strident
in
his
opposition
and
let
it
be
known
that
any
attempt
to
have
the
Senate
ratify
the
Statute
would
be
"
dead
on
arrival
"
at
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
.

He
also
introduced
the
American
Service-Members
'
Protection
Act
,
adopted
by
Congress
in
0000
"
to
protect
United
States
military
personnel
and
other
elected
and
appointed
officials
of
the
United
States
government
against

prosecution
by
an
international
criminal
court
to
which
the
United
States
is
not
party
"
.

In
0000
,
Bono
sought
out
Jesse
Helms
to
discuss
increasing
American
aid
to
Africa
.

In
Africa
,
AIDS
is
a
disease
that
is
primarily
transmitted
heterosexually
,
and
Helms
sympathized
with
Bono
's
description
of
"
the
pain
it
is
bringing
to
infants
and
children
and
their
families
"
.

Helms
insisted
that
Bono
involve
the
international
community
and
private
sector
,
so
that
relief
efforts
would
not
be
paid
for
by
"
just
Americans
"
.

Helms
coauthored
a
bill
authorizing
$
000
million
for
international
AIDS
relief
efforts
.

In
0000
,
Helms
announced
that
he
was
ashamed
to
have
done
so
little
during
his
Senate
career
to
fight
the
worldwide
spread
of
AIDS
,
and
pledged
to
do
more
during
his
last
few
months
in
the
Senate
.

Helms
spoke
with
special
appreciation
of
the
efforts
of
Janet
Museveni
,
first
lady
of
Uganda
,
for
her
efforts
to
stop
the
spread
of
AIDS
through
a
campaign
based
on
"
biblical
values
and
sexual
purity
"
.

Helms
also
was
a
proponent
in
trying
to
dissolve
the
United
States
Agency
for
International
Development
.

Because
of
recurring
health
problems
,
including
bone
disorders
,
prostate
cancer
and
heart
disease
,
Helms
did
not
seek
re-election
in
0000
.

His
Senate
seat
was
won
by
Elizabeth
Dole
,
a
former
Johnson
,
Nixon
and
Ford
presidential
advisor
who
served
as
Ronald
Reagan
's
Transportation
Secretary
(
which
at
that
time
included
the
Coast
Guard
)
,
George
H.W.
Bush
's
Labor
Secretary
,
and
a
former
Presidential
candidate
,
who
also
happened
to
be
the
wife
of
long-time
colleague
and
former
Senator
Bob
Dole
of
Kansas
.

Dole
held
the
seat
for
a
single
term
,
losing
her
0000
re-election
bid
to
Democrat
Kay
Hagan
.

Post-Senate
life
(
0000
—
0000
)
In
0000
,
he
spoke
out
for
the
election
of
Republican
U.S.
Representative
Richard
Burr
,
who
,
like
Elizabeth
Dole
two
years
earlier
,
defeated
Democrat
Erskine
Bowles
to
win
the
other
North
Carolina
Senate
seat
.

In
September
0000
,
Random
House
published
his
memoir
Here
's
Where
I
Stand
.

In
his
memoirs
,
he
likened
abortion
to
the
Holocaust
and
the
September
00
terrorist
attacks
stating
,
"
I
will
never
be
silent
about
the
death
of
those
who
can
not
speak
for
themselves
.
"

Helms
had
also
been
recruited
by
pop
star
Bono
for
charity
work
.

In
0000
,
after
turning
down
requests
for
his
papers
to
be
left
to
an
Ivy
League
university
,
he
designated
Wingate
University
as
the
repository
of
the
official
papers
and
historical
items
from
his
Senate
career
,
where
the
Jesse
Helms
Center
is
based
to
promote
his
legacy
.

In
0000
,
Liberty
University
opened
the
Jesse
Helms
School
of
Government
with
Helms
present
at
the
dedication
.

Death
Helms
's
health
remained
poor
after
he
retired
from
the
Senate
in
0000
.

In
April
0000
,
news
reports
disclosed
that
Helms
had
multi-infarct
dementia
,
which
leads
to
failing
memory
and
diminished
cognitive
function
,
as
well
as
a
number
of
physical
difficulties
.

He
was
later
moved
into
a
convalescent
center
near
his
home
.

Helms
died
of
vascular
dementia
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
July
0
,
0000
,
at
the
age
of
00
.

He
is
buried
in
Historic
Oakwood
Cemetery
in
Raleigh
,
North
Carolina
.

Social
and
political
views
Views
on
minorities
Helms
opposed
many
progressive
policies
regarding
race
,
such
as
busing
,
the
Civil
Rights
Act
and
the
Voting
Rights
Act
.

He
once
referred
to
the
University
of
North
Carolina
(
UNC
)
as
the
"
University
of
Negroes
and
Communists
"
.

Helms
called
the
Civil
Rights
Act
of
0000
"
the
single
most
dangerous
piece
of
legislation
ever
introduced
in
the
Congress
"
,
and
sponsored
legislation
to
either
extend
it
to
the
entire
country
or
scrap
it
altogether
.

Helms
reminded
voters
that
he
tried
,
with
a
00-day
filibuster
,
to
stop
the
Senate
from
approving
a
federal
holiday
to
honor
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr.
,
although
he
had
fewer
reservations
about
establishing
a
North
Carolina
state
holiday
for
King
.

He
has
been
accused
of
being
a
segregationist
by
some
political
observers
and
scholars
,
such
as
USA
Today
s
DeWayne
Wickham
who
wrote
that
Helms
"
subtly
carried
the
torch
of
white
supremacy
"
from
Ben
Tillman
.

In
0000
the
Department
of
Justice
admonished
Helms
's
0000
campaign
for
mailing
000,000
postcards
to
households
in
predominantly
African-American
precincts
warning
them
(
incorrectly
)
that
they
could
go
to
jail
if
they
had
not
updated
their
addresses
on
the
electoral
register
since
moving
.

Helms
opposed
"
every
piece
of
civil
rights
and
affirmative
action
legislation
"
and
blocked
"
black
judges
from
being
considered
for
the
federal
bench
"
.

In
0000
,
he
voted
against
the
extension
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
.

Helms
opposed
busing
,
supported
the
"
racist
apartheid
regime
of
South
Africa
"
,
and
"
for
years
blocked
attempts
by
President
Bill
Clinton
to
appoint
a
Black
judge
on
the
Fourth
U.S.
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
"
.

Only
when
Helms
's
own
judicial
choices
were
threatened
with
blocking
did
attorney
Roger
Gregory
of
Richmond
,
Virginia
get
confirmed
.

Helms
also
tried
to
block
the
nomination
of
Carol
Moseley
Braun
,
the
first
African-American
female
senator
,
as
ambassador
to
New
Zealand
.

Views
on
homosexuality
Helms
had
a
negative
view
of
lesbian
,
gay
,
bisexual
,
and
transgender
(
LGBT
)
people
and
LGBT
rights
in
the
United
States
.

Helms
called
homosexuals
"
weak
,
morally
sick
wretches
"
and
tried
to
cut
funding
for
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
for
supporting
the
"
gay-oriented
artwork
of
photographer
Robert
Mapplethorpe
"
.

In
0000
,
when
then-president
Bill
Clinton
wanted
to
appoint
'
out
'
lesbian
Roberta
Achtenberg
to
assistant
secretary
of
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
,
Helms
held
up
the
confirmation
"
because
she
's
a
damn
lesbian
"
,
adding
"
she
's
not
your
garden-variety
lesbian
.

She
's
a
militant-activist-mean
lesbian
"
.

Helms
also
stated
"
I
'm
not
going
to
put
a
lesbian
in
a
position
like
that
.

If
you
want
to
call
me
a
bigot
,
fine
.
"

When
Clinton
urged
that
gays
be
allowed
to
serve
openly
in
the
armed
forces
,
Helms
said
the
president
"
better
have
a
bodyguard
"
if
he
visited
North
Carolina
.

His
views
on
gay
and
lesbian
citizens
were
depicted
in
the
0000
documentary
film
Dear
Jesse
.

Helms
initially
fought
against
increasing
federal
financing
for
HIV/AIDS
research
and
treatment
,
saying
the
disease
resulted
from
"
unnatural
"
and
"
disgusting
"
homosexual
behavior
.
"

There
is
not
one
single
case
of
AIDS
in
this
country
that
can
not
be
traced
in
origin
to
sodomy
,
"
he
said
in
0000
.

In
his
final
Senate
year
,
he
strongly
supported
AIDS
measures
in
Africa
,
where
heterosexual
transmission
of
the
disease
is
most
common
,
and
continued
to
hold
the
belief
that
the
"
homosexual
lifestyle
"
is
the
cause
of
the
spread
of
the
epidemic
in
America
.

Personal
life
Family
Jesse
and
Dot
had
three
children
:
Jane
,
Nancy
of
Raleigh
,
and
Charles
Helms
of
Winston-Salem
,
North
Carolina
.

Charles
was
a
nine-year-old
orphan
with
cerebral
palsy
who
they
adopted
after
reading
in
a
newspaper
that
Charles
wanted
a
mother
and
father
for
Christmas
.

The
couple
had
seven
grandchildren
and
one
great-grandchild
.

Religious
views
Helms
was
well
known
for
his
strong
religious
views
.

He
played
a
leading
role
in
the
development
of
the
Christian
right
,
and
was
a
founding
member
of
the
Moral
Majority
in
0000
.

Although
a
Southern
Baptist
from
his
upbringing
in
a
strictly
literalist
,
but
hawkishly
secularist
,
environment
,
when
in
Raleigh
,
Helms
worshipped
at
the
moderate
Hayes-Barton
Baptist
Church
,
where
he
had
served
as
a
deacon
and
Sunday
school
teacher
before
his
election
to
the
Senate
.

Helms
was
close
to
fellow
North
Carolinian
Billy
Graham
(
whom
he
considered
a
personal
hero
)
,
as
well
as
Charles
Stanley
,
Pat
Robertson
,
and
Jerry
Falwell
,
whose
Liberty
University
dedicated
its
Jesse
Helms
School
of
Government
to
Helms
.

Helms
helped
found
Camp
Willow
Run
,
an
interdenominational
Christian
summer
camp
,
sitting
on
its
board
of
directors
until
his
death
,
and
was
a
Grand
Orator
of
the
Grand
Lodge
of
freemasons
in
North
Carolina
.

Equating
leftism
and
atheism
,
Helms
argued
that
the
downfall
of
the
USA
was
due
to
loss
of
Christian
faith
,
and
often
stated
,
"
I
think
God
is
giving
this
country
one
more
chance
to
save
itself
"
.

He
believed
that
the
morality
of
capitalism
was
assured
in
the
Bible
,
through
the
Parable
of
the
Talents
.

He
believed
,
writing
in
When
Free
Men
Shall
Stand
,
that
"
such
utopian
slogans
as
Peace
with
Honor
,
Minimum
Wage
,
Racial
Equality
,
Women
's
Liberation
,
National
Health
Insurance
,
Civil
Liberty
"
are
ploys
by
which
to
divide
humanity
"
as
sons
of
God
"
.

Awards
Helms
held
honorary
degrees
from
several
religious
universities
including
Bob
Jones
University
,
Campbell
University
,
Grove
City
College
,
and
his
alma
mater
,
Wingate
University
.

Addington
Palace
is
an
00th
century
mansion
in
Addington
near
Croydon
,
South
London
,
England
.

History
The
original
manor
house
called
'
Addington
Place
'
was
built
about
the
00th
century
.

The
Addington
estate
was
owned
by
the
Leigh
family
until
early
00th
century
.

Sir
John
Leigh
died
without
heirs
in
0000
and
his
estates
went
to
distant
relatives
,
who
eventually
sold
to
Barlow
Trecothick
.

Mr
Trecothick
had
been
raised
in
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
and
became
a
merchant
there
;
he
then
moved
to
London
still
trading
as
a
merchant
,
and
later
became
Lord
Mayor
and
then
an
MP
.

He
bought
the
estate
for
£
00,000
and
then
became
Lord
Mayor
of
the
City
of
London
in
0000
.

He
built
a
new
house
,
designed
by
Robert
Mylne
in
the
Palladian
style
;
a
country
mansion
with
single-storey
wings
.

He
died
before
it
was
completed
in
0000
and
it
was
inherited
by
his
heir
,
James
Ivers
,
who
had
to
take
the
surname
'
Trecothick
'
in
order
to
inherit
the
estate
.

James
continued
the
work
on
the
house
,
having
the
substantial
grounds
and
gardens
landscaped
by
Lancelot
"
Capability
"
Brown
.

Due
to
financial
difficulties
,
James
Trecothick
had
to
sell
the
estate
in
0000
.

The
estate
was
sold
in
lots
in
0000
.

The
next
owners
(
William
Coles
and
Westgarth
Snaith
)
also
got
into
financial
trouble
and
sold
it
by
Act
of
Parliament
in
0000
.

This
enabled
the
mansion
to
be
purchased
for
the
Archbishops
of
Canterbury
,
since
nearby
Croydon
Palace
had
become
inconvenient
.

It
was
now
called
'
Addington
Farm
'
by
the
Archbishops
.

It
was
the
residence
for
six
Archbishops
of
Canterbury
.

The
archbishops
made
further
changes
and
enlarged
the
building
;
work
on
the
building
was
overseen
by
Richard
Norman
Shaw
.

The
palace
became
the
official
second
residence
of
six
archbishops
:
All
except
Benson
are
buried
in
St
Mary
's
Church
and
churchyard
in
Addington
.

The
'
Palace
'
was
sold
in
0000
to
Mr
F.A.
English
,
a
diamond
merchant
from
South
Africa
.

After
his
death
,
the
house
in
World
War
I
was
taken
over
by
the
Red
Cross
and
became
a
fever
hospital
,
but
eventually
it
came
into
the
hands
of
the
County
Borough
of
Croydon
in
0000
.

Current
Usage
The
house
was
Grade
II
listed
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
it
was
leased
to
the
Royal
School
of
Church
Music
and
served
as
head
office
for
its
music
publishing
operation
,
as
well
as
serving
as
a
residential
college
and
choir
school
until
0000
,
when
a
private
company
took
it
over
for
development
as
a
conference
and
banqueting
venue
,
health
farm
and
country
club
.

It
is
used
extensively
for
wedding
s.
It
is
surrounded
by
a
park
and
golf
courses
,
and
its
gardens
are
still
largely
in
their
original
design
.

Much
of
the
grounds
have
been
leased
by
golf
clubs
and
the
exclusive
Bishops
Walk
housing
development
was
built
on
Bishops
Walk
(
a
private
road
)
.

A
famous
very
large
cedar
tree
stands
next
to
the

the
National
Highway

Administration
(

NHTSA
states
000,000

The
Bureau
of
Justice
Statistics
estimated
that
in

enforcement
agencies
made
0,000,000
arrests
nationwide
for

peak
year
in
0000
,
accounting
for
0
out
of
every
00
licensed
drivers
in

U.S.
NHTSA
defines
fatal
collisions
as
"
alcohol-related
"
if
they
believe
the
driver
,
a
passenger
,
or
non-motorist
(
such
as
a
pedestrian
or
pedal
cyclist
)
had
a
blood
alcohol
content
(
BAC
)
of
0.00
%
or
greater
.

NHTSA
defines
nonfatal
collisions
as
alcohol-related
if
the
accident
report
indicates
evidence
of
alcohol
present
.

NHTSA
specifically
notes
that
alcohol-related
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
driver
or
non
occupant
was
tested
for
alcohol
and
that
the
term
does
not
indicate
a
collision
or
fatality
was
caused
by
the
presence
of
alcohol
.

On
average
,
about
00
%
of
the
BAC
values
are
missing
or
unknown
.

To
analyze
what
they
believe
is
the
complete
data
,
statisticians
simulate
BAC
information
.

Drivers
with
a
BAC
of
0.00
%
are
0

times
more
likely
to
get
into
a
fatal

in
some
jurisdictions
merely
being
in
physical
control
of
)
a
motor
vehicle
while
being
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
drugs
or
a
combination
of
both
.

The
key
inquiry
focuses
on
whether
the
driver
's
faculties
were
impaired
by
the
substance
that
was
consumed
.

The
detection
and
successful
prosecution
of
drivers
impaired
by
prescription
medication
or
illegal
drugs
can
therefore
be
difficult
.

Breathalyzer
s
have
been
developed
for
the
purpose
of
administering
roadside
or
laboratory
tests
that
can
detect
the
actual
level
of
a
controlled
substance
in
an
individual
's
body
.

All
states
in
the
U.S.
designate
a
per
se
blood
or
breath
alcohol
level
as
the
threshold
point
for
an
independent
criminal
offense
.

A
second
criminal
offense
of
driving
"
under
the
influence
"
or
"
while
impaired
"
is
also
usually
charged
in
most
states
,
with
a
permissive
presumption
of
guilt
where
the
person
's
BAC
is
0.00
%
or
greater
(
units
of
milligrams
per
deciliter
,
representing
0
g
of
alcohol
in
00
liters
of
blood
)
.

Some
states
(
e.g.
,
Colorado
)
include
a
lesser
charge
,
sometimes
referred
to
as
"
driving
while
ability
impaired
"
that
may
apply
to
individuals
with
a
0.00
%
or
above
,
but
less
than
the
0.00
%
per
se
limit
for
the
more
serious
charge
.

Wisconsin
regards
first
offense
drunk
driving
as
a
municipal
offense
,
and
New
Jersey
treats
all
drunk
driving
cases
without
serious
injury
or
death
as
traffic
violations
.

The
amount
of
alcohol
intake
to
reach
a
BAC
of
0.00
%
may
vary
with
the
individual
's
body
composition
and
state
of
health
.

Prior
to
increased
emphasis
on
drinking
and
driving
in
the
0000s
,
standards
of
0.00
%
-0.00
%
were
in
place
.

The
legal
limit
for
commercial
drivers
in
New
York
is
set
at
0.00
%
.

Flying
under
the
influence
and
related
laws
Federal
Aviation
Regulation
00.00
(
)
prohibits
pilots
from
flying
aircraft
with
an
alcohol
level
of
0.00
%
or
more
,
or
within
eight
hours
of
consuming
alcohol
,
or
while
under
the
impairing
influence
of
any
drug
.

The
same
prohibition
applies
to
any
other
crew
members
on
duty
aboard
the
aircraft
(
flight
attendants
,
etc.
)
.

Some
airlines
impose
additional
restrictions
,
and
many
pilots
also
impose
stricter
standards
upon
themselves
.

Commercial
pilots
found
to
be
in
violation
of
regulations
are
typically
fired
or
resign
voluntarily
,
and
they
may
lose
their
pilot
certificates
and
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
under
Federal
or
State
laws
,
effectively
ending
their
careers
.

Similar
laws
apply
to
other
activities
involving
transportation
;
Michigan
prohibits
intoxicated
bicycling
,
horseback
riding
,
buggy
driving
,
use
of
motorized
farm
implements
,
or
boating
,
the
latter
whether
a
pilot
or
passenger
,
with
much
the
same
threshold
of
intoxication
.

In
the
case
of
boating
,
the
laws
extend
to
include
kayaks
,
canoes
,
sailboats
—
any
floatation
device
that
needs
to
be
steered
in
water
.

Different
states
have
different
laws
and
classifications
on
the
level
of
transgression
attached
to
a
citation
for
boating
under
the
influence
.

Physician
reporting
Six
states
require
physicians
to
report
patients
who
drive
while
impaired
.

Another
00
states
permit
physicians
to
violate
doctor-patient
confidentiality
to
report
impaired
drivers
,
if
they
so
choose
.

The
American
Medical
Association
endorsed
physician
reporting
in
0000
,
but
deferred
to
the
states
on
whether
such
notification
should
be
mandatory
or
permissive
.

Medical
bioethicist
Jacob
Appel
of
New
York
University
says
physician
reporting
may
deter
some
patients
from
seeking
care
,
writing
"
Reporting
may
remove
some
dangerous
drivers
from
the
roads
,
but
if
in
doing
so
it
actually
creates
other
dangerous
drivers
,
by
scaring
them
away
from
treatment
,
then
society
has
sacrificed
confidentiality
for
no
tangible
return
in
lives
saved
.
"

Driving
While
Impaired
courts
These
innovative
courts
use
substance
abuse
intervention
with
repeat
offenders
who
plead
guilty
to
driving
while
intoxicated
.

Those
accepted
into
the
diversionary
program
are
required
to
abstain
from
alcohol
.

Some
are
required
to
wear
a
device
that
monitors
and
records
any
levels
of
alcohol
detected
in
their
bloodstreams
.

Criminal
penalties
Many
jurisdictions
require
more
such
as
jail
time
and
larger
fines
.

Compared
to
many
other
countries
,
penalties
for
drunk
driving
in
the
United
States
are
light
,
unless
alcohol
is
involved
in
an
incident
causing
injury
or
death
of
others
,
in
which
case
they
are
very
heavy
compared
to
other
nations
.

Some
states
,
such
as
Wisconsin
,
do
not
permanently
revoke
driving
permits
even
if
the
offender
is
convicted
multiple
times
.

Administrative
and
civil
penalties
The
federal
Assimilative
Crimes
Act
,
which
makes
state
law
applicable
on
lands
reserved
or
acquired
by
the
Federal
government
when
the
act
or
omission
is
not
made
punishable
by
an
enactment
of
Congress
,
recognizes
collateral
actions
related
to
DUI
convictions
as
punishments
.

According
to
:
Restricted
licensesMost
states
do
allow
certain
DUI
offenders
(
usually
first-time
)
to
obtain
a
restricted
or
hardship
license
while
on
suspension
.

This
license
permits
them
to
drive
to
and
from
work
or
school
.

Currently
only
Alabama
,
Kansas
,
New
Hampshire
,
New
Jersey
and
Vermont
do
not
allow
for
this
type
of
license
.

SR-00An
SR-00
is
an
administrative
form
that
attests
to
an
insurance
company
's
coverage
,
or
the
posting
of
a
personal
public
bond
in
the
amount
of
the
state
's
minimum
liability
coverage
for
the
licensed
driver
/
or
vehicle
registration
.

The
SR
in
SR-00
stands
for
Safety
Responsibility
,
and
it
's
needed
to
reinstate
a
suspended
driver
's
license
after
a
DUI
conviction
.

It
is
submitted
to
the
state
by
an
auto
insurance
company
to
serve
as
proof
that
a
driver
has
the
minimum
liability
insurance
that
the
states
requires
.

SR-00s
are
typically
filed
with
the
respective
State
's
DMV
,
and
in
some
States
must
be
carried
by
the
licensed
driver
,
or
in
the
registered
vehicle
(
particularly
if
the
licensee
has
been
cited
for
coverage
lapses
,
DUI
or
other
administrative
infractions
)
.

SR-00s
may
attest
coverage
for
a
vehicle
regardless
of
operator
(
owner
liability
coverage
)
,
or
cover
a
specific
person
regardless
of
the
specific
vehicle
operated
(
operator
liability
coverage
)
.

The
form
is
required
in
00
states
and
the
US
District
of
Columbia
in
order
to
register
a
vehicle
for
usage
on
public
roads
.

It
is
also
required
to
redeem
a
license
which
has
been
suspended
due
to
coverage
lapse
in
these
required
states
.

These
states
also
,
generally
,
require
that
the
issuing
insurance
company
provide
the
relevant
state
's
DMV
with
timely
updates
as
to
the
status
of
such
coverage
.

If
the
policy
with
the
SR00
cancels
,
a
form
called
an
SR00
is
issued
and
sent
to
the
state
DMV
.

Upon
notice
that
there
has
been
a
lapse
in
coverage
,
the
state
will
suspend
the
driver
's
license
again
.

Another
SR-00
filing
will
need
to
be
submitted
to
regain
driving
privileges
.

Diversion
programsSome
jurisdictions
,
such
as
those
in
California
,
may
impose
the
completion
of
diversion
program
s
(
also
known
as
DUI
programs
)
.

One
such
program
is
the
Victim
Impact
Panel
(
VIP
)
administered
by
Mothers
Against
Drunk
Driving
(
MADD
)
since
0000
.

DUI
plates
In
0000
,
Ohio
began
to
issue
special
license
plates
to
DUI
offenders
who
are
granted
limited
driving
privileges
such
as
work-related
driving
until
a
court
can
rule
that
they
can
have
full
privileges
back
.

However
,
judges
rarely
enforced
the
plates
,
so
in
0000
,
the
plates
became
mandated
by
state
law
to
all
DUI
offenders
.

Unlike
Ohio
's
standard-issue
plates
(
which
as
of
0000
have
a
picture
of
the
Ohio
country
side
)
,
the
DUI
plates
are
yellow
with
red
writing
with
no
registration
stickers
or
graphics
.

They
are
commonly
referred
to
as
"
party
plates
"
.

Minnesota
has
a
similar
program
,
where
the
plates
are
white
with
either
blue
or
black
text
.

The
plate
number
is
a
"
W
"
,
followed
by
a
letter
and
four
numbers
.

These
plates
may
be
issued
to
drivers
with
at
least
0
DUIs
in
a
ten-year
period
.

In
Minnesota
,
DUI
plates
are
referred
to
as
"
whiskey
plates
"
,
whiskey
being
the
name
of
the
letter
W
in
the
NATO
phonetic
alphabet
.

Ignition
interlock
devicesSome
states
,
such
as
California
,
may
impose
the
installation
of
ignition
interlock
devices
in
cases
where
the
driver
's
BAC
is
over
0.00
%
,
or
0.00
%
in
some
places
.

These
additional
sanctions
are
an
attempt
to
deter
and
punish
the
operation
of
a
vehicle
at
extremely
high
BAC
levels
and
the
concomitant
danger
posed
to
the
safety
of
persons
and
property
by
heavily
impaired
drivers
.

As
of
July
0
,
0000
,
California
implemented
a
pilot
project
for
DUI
sentencing
.

In
two
counties
,
Los
Angeles
and
Alameda
,
first
offenders
convicted
of
drunk
driving
are
required
to
install
an
ignition
interlock
device
in
their
car
for
a
period
of
five
months
.

Previously
,
this
requirement
was
only
mandated
for
second
offenders
and
then
for
a
three-year
period
.

California
DMV
has
now
written
guidelines
to
clear
up
any
ambiguities
in
the
law
.

Vehicle
impoundment
and
forfeitureSome
states
,
such
as
California
,
allow
for
the
impoundment
and
forfeiture
of
vehicles
under
certain
conditions
.

History
of
drunken
driving
laws
The
first
jurisdiction
in
the
United
States
of
America
to
adopt
laws
against
drunken
driving
was
New
York
in
0000
,
with
California
and
others
following
.

Early
laws
simply
prohibited
driving
while
intoxicated
,
requiring
proof
of
a
state
of
intoxication
with
no
specific
definition
of
what
level
of
inebriation
qualified
.

The
first
generally-accepted
legal
BAC
limit
was
0.00
%
.

In
0000
,
the
American
Medical
Association
created
a
"
Committee
to
Study
Problems
of
Motor
Vehicle
Accidents
"
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
National
Safety
Council
set
up
a
"
Committee
on
Tests
for
Intoxication
"
.

In
the
US
,
most
of
the
laws
and
penalties
were
greatly
enhanced
starting
in
the
late
0000s
,
and
through
the
0000s
,
largely
due
to
pressure
from
groups
like
Mothers
Against
Drunk
Driving
(
MADD
)
and
Students
Against
Destructive
Decisions
(
SADD
)
and
leaders
like
Candy
Lightner
.

Significantly
,
zero
tolerance
laws
were
enacted
which
criminalized
driving
a
vehicle
with
0.00
%
or
0.00
%
BAC
for
drivers
under
00
.

This
is
true
even
in
Puerto
Rico
,
despite
maintaining
a
legal
drinking
age
of
00
.

Statistics
In
the
United
States
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
(
NHTSA
)
estimates
that
00,000
people
died
in
0000
in
alcohol-related
collisions
,
representing
00
%
of
total
traffic
death
s
in
the
US
.

NHTSA
states
000,000
were
injured
in
alcohol-related
accidents
in
0000
.

The
Bureau
of
Justice
Statistics
estimated
that
in
0000
local
law
enforcement
agencies
made
0,000,000
arrests
nationwide
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
,
0
out
of
every
00
arrests
for
all
crimes
in
the
U.S.
,
compared
to
0.0
million
such
arrests
during
the
peak
year
in
0000
,
accounting
for
0
out
of
every
00
licensed
drivers
in
the
U.S.
.

This
represented
a
000
%
increase
in
DUI
arrests
from
0000
to
0000
,
while
the
number
of
licensed
drivers
increased
by
just
00
%
in
the
same
period
.

The
arrest
rate
for
alcohol-related
offenses
among
American
Indian
s
was
more
than
double
that
for
the
total
population
during
0000
,
and
almost
0
in
00
American
Indians
held
in
local
jails
had
been
charged
with
a
public
order
offense
,
most
commonly
driving
while
intoxicated
.

In
0000
an
estimated
000,000
DUI
offenders
were
under
correctional
supervision
,
down
from
000,000
in
0000
and
up
from
000,000
in
0000
.

NHTSA
defines
fatal
collisions
as
"
alcohol-related
"
if
they
believe
the
driver
,
a
passenger
,
or
non-motorist
(
such
as
a
pedestrian
or
pedal
cyclist
)
had
a
BAC
of
0.00
%
or
greater
.

NHTSA
defines
nonfatal
collisions
as
alcohol-related
if
the
accident
report
indicates
evidence
of
alcohol
present
.

NHTSA
specifically
notes
that
alcohol-related
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
driver
or
non
occupant
was
tested
for
alcohol
and
that
the
term
does
not
indicate
a
collision
or
fatality
was
caused
by
the
presence
of
alcohol
.

On
average
,
about
00
%
of
the
BAC
values
are
missing
or
unknown
.

To
analyze
what
they
believe
is
the
complete
data
,
statisticians
simulate
BAC
information
.

Drivers
with
a
BAC
of
0.00
%
are
0
to
00
times
more
likely
to
get
into
a
fatal
crash
or
injury
than
drivers
with
no
alcohol
.

The
NHTSA
maintains
a
Digest
of
Impaired
Driving
and
Select
Beverage
Control
Laws
.

Typical
DUI
investigation
and
arrest
Following
are
common
procedures
when
a
law
enforcement
officer
has
reason
to
suspect
a
driver
is
intoxicated
.

Reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
There
are
several
situations
in
which
the
officer
will
come
into
contact
with
a
driver
,
some
examples
are
:
The
following
list
of
DUI
symptoms
,
from
a
publication
issued
by
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
(
DOT
HS-000-000
)
,
is
widely
used
in
training
officers
to
detect
drunk
drivers
.

After
each
symptom
is
a
percentage
figure
which
,
according
to
NHTSA
,
indicates
the
statistical
chances
through
research
,
that
a
driver
is
over
the
legal
limit
.

If
the
officer
observes
enough
to
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
legally
justify
a
further
detention
and
investigation
,
they
will
ask
the
driver
to
step
out
of
the
vehicle
.

Reasonable
suspicion
requires
less
evidence
than
probable
cause
,
but
more
than
a
mere
hunch
.

A
rule
of
thumb
is
that
reasonable
suspicion
requires
00
%
proof
,
and
probable
cause
requires
more
than
00
%
statistical
chance
.

Therefore
,
if
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest
for
DWI
,
as
suggested
by
the
research
and
examples
used
above
,
then
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
a
driver
.

Investigation
The
officer
will
typically
approach
the
driver
's
window
and
ask
some
preliminary
questions
.

During
this
phase
of
the
stop
the
officer
will
note
if
they
detect
any
of
the
following
indicators
of
intoxication
If
the
officer
observes
enough
to
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
legally
justify
a
further
detention
and
investigation
,
they
will
ask
the
driver
to
step
out
of
the
vehicle
.

Field
sobriety
tests
One
of
the
most
controversial
aspects
of
a
DUI
stop
is
the
field
sobriety
test
(
FSTs
)
.

The
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
(
NHTSA
)
has
developed
a
model
system
for
managing
Standardized
Field
Sobriety
Test
(
SFST
)
training
.

They
have
published
numerous
training
manuals
associated
with
FSTs
.

As
a
result
of
the
NHTSA
studies
,
the
walk-and-turn
test
was
determined
to
be
00
%
accurate
,
and
the
one-leg
stand
test
is
only
00
%
accurate
when
administered
to
people
within
the
study
parameters
.

The
tests
were
not
validated
for
people
with
medical
conditions
,
injuries
,
00
years
or
older
,
and
00
pounds
or
greater
overweight
.

The
officer
will
administer
one
or
more
field
sobriety
tests
.

FSTs
are
"
divided
attention
tests
"
that
test
the
suspect
's
ability
to
perform
the
type
of
mental
and
physical
multitasking
that
is
required
to
operate
an
automobile
.

However
,
these
tests
can
be
problematic
for
people
with
nonobvious
disabilities
affecting
proprioception
,
such
as
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome
.

The
three
validated
tests
by
NHTSA
are
:
Alternative
tests
,
which
have
not
been
scientifically
validated
,
include
:
Although
most
law
enforcement
agencies
continue
to
use
a
variety
of
these
FSTs
,
increasingly
a
0-test
battery
of
standardized
field
sobriety
tests
(
SFSTs
)
is
being
adopted
.

The
NHTSA-approved
battery
of
tests
consists
of
the
horizontal
gaze
nystagmus
test
,
the
walk-and-turn
test
,
and
the
one-leg-stand
.

In
some
states
,
such
as
Ohio
,
only
the
standardized
tests
will
be
admitted
into
evidence
,
provided
they
were
administered
and
objectively
scored
"
in
substantial
compliance
"
with
NHTSA
standards
(
ORC
0000.00
(
D
)
(
0
)
(
b
)
)
.

According
to
original
studies
conducted
by
NHTSA
,
these
tests
are
not
designed
to
detect
impairment
,
but
rather
give
a
probability
that
a
driver
is
at
or
above
a
0.00
%
BAC
.

However
,
studies
throw
doubt
on
the
tests
'
usefulness
in
helping
an
officer
to
judge
either
.

In
0000
,
Dr.
Spurgeon
Cole
of
Clemson
University
conducted
a
study
of
the
accuracy
of
FSTs
.

His
staff
videotaped
people
performing
six
common
field
sobriety
tests
,
then
showed
the
tapes
to
00
police
officers
and
asked
them
to
decide
whether
the
suspects
had
"
had
too
much
to
drink
and
drive
"
(
sic
)
.

The
blood-alcohol
concentration
of
each
of
the
00
DUI
subjects
was
0.00
,
unknown
to
the
officers
.

The
result
:
the
officers
gave
their
opinion
that
00
%
of
these
innocent
people
were
too
drunk
to
be
able
to
drive
.

This
study
showed
the
possible
inaccuracy
of
FSTs
.

An
increasingly
used
field
sobriety
test
involves
having
the
suspect
breathe
into
a
small
,
handheld
breath
testing
device
.

Called
variously
a
PAS
(
"
preliminary
alcohol
screening
"
)
or
PBT
(
"
preliminary
breath
test
"
)
,
the
units
are
small
,
inexpensive
versions
of
the
larger
,
more
sophisticated
instruments
at
the
police
stations
,
the
EBTs
(
"
evidentiary
breath
test
"
)
.

Whereas
the
EBTs
usually
employ
infrared
spectroscopy
,
the
PAS
units
use
a
relatively
simple
electrochemical
(
fuel
cell
)
technology
.

Their
purpose
,
along
with
other
FSTs
,
is
to
assist
the
officer
in
determining
probable
cause
for
arrest
.

Although
,
because
of
their
relative
inaccuracy
,
they
were
never
intended
to
be
used
in
court
for
proving
actual
blood-alcohol
concentration
,
some
courts
have
begun
to
admit
them
as
evidence
of
BAC
.

Probable
cause
to
arrest
If
the
officer
has
sufficient
probable
cause
that
the
suspect
has
been
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
,
they
will
make
the
arrest
,
handcuff
the
suspect
and
transport
them
to
the
police
station
.

En
route
,
the
officer
may
advise
them
of
their
Miranda
rights
and
their
legal
implied
consent
obligation
to
submit
to
an
evidentiary
chemical
test
of
blood
,
breath
or
possibly
urine
.

Laws
relating
to
what
exactly
constitutes
probable
cause
vary
from
state
to
state
.

In
California
it
is
a
refutable
presumption
that
a
person
with
a
BAC
of
0.00
%
or
higher
is
driving
under
the
influence
.

However
,
section
00000
(
a
)
(
0
)
of
the
California
Vehicle
Code
states
that
driving
with
a
BAC
between
0.00
%
and
0.00
%
"
shall
not
give
rise
to
any
presumption
that
the
person
was
or
was
not
under
the
influence
of
an
alcoholic
beverage
"
.

Chemical
test
At
the
police
station
,
the
arrestee
will
be
offered
a
chemical
test
of
breath
,
blood
or
,
much
less
frequently
,
urine
.

Breath
test
results
are
usually
available
immediately
;
urine
and
blood
samples
are
sent
to
a
lab
for
later
analysis
to
determine
the
BAC
or
possible
presence
of
drugs
.

If
the
arrestee
refuses
to
submit
to
chemical
testing
,
they
will
usually
be
booked
for
driving
under
the
influence
;
there
will
be
no
evidence
for
filing
the
second
charge
of
driving
with
0.00
%
BAC
.

In
some
cases
the
arrestee
may
be
charged
with
DUI
even
after
passing
a
breathalyzer
test
if
he
or
she
refuses
also
to
take
subsequent
urine
or
blood
tests
.

However
,
the
refusal
will
carry
increased
penalties
on
the
driving
under
the
influence
charge
(
typically
a
longer
license
suspension
or
an
increased
jail
sentence
)
,
and
the
act
of
refusing
may
be
admissible
in
court
as
evidence
of
"
consciousness
of
guilt
"
.

In
some
states
,
refusal
to
submit
to
a
chemical
test
can
result
in
an
automatic
suspension
of
driving
privileges
,
regardless
of
whether
the
suspect
is
convicted
of
DUI
.

In
an
increasing
number
of
jurisdictions
,
if
the
suspect
refuses
to
take
a
chemical
test
the
police
in
some
states
may
seek
a
search
warrant
to
draw
a
sample
of
blood
.

This
is
particularly
common
in
situations
involving
an
accident
with
injury
or
death
.

In
common
law
jurisdictions
this
requires
obtaining
a
search
warrant
from
a
criminal
magistrate
.

Some
states
have
'
implied
consent
'
laws
,
agreed
to
when
applied
for
a
driver
's
license
.

By
signing
the
driver
's
license
application
,
consent
is
implied
to
allow
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
direct
a
medical
professional
to
draw
blood
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
BAC
,
in
case
of
being
arrested
on
suspicion
of
DUI
.

Even
if
a
breath
test
is
refused
,
because
of
the
'
implied
consent
'
,
officers
can
still
seek
a
search
warrant
to
draw
a
blood
sample
for
BAC
determination
.

Some
commentators
,
such
as
Brown
University
's
Jacob
Appel
,
have
criticized
the
role
of
medical
personnel
in
this
process
.

According
to
Appel
,
"
If
physicians
acquiesce
today
in
the
removal
of
a
resistant
patient
's
blood
,
soon
they
may
be
called
upon
to
pump
the
contents
of
an
unwilling
patient
's
stomach
or
even
to
perform
involuntary
surgery
to
retrieve
an
evidential
bullet
"
.

While
chemical
tests
are
used
to
determine
the
driver
's
BAC
,
they
do
not
determine
the
driver
's
level
of
impairment
.

However
,
state
laws
usually
provide
for
a
rebuttable
legal
presumption
of
intoxication
at
a
BAC
of
0.00
%
or
higher
(
see
blood
alcohol
test
assumptions
)
.

Booking
and
charging
If
it
is
determined
after
arrest
that
the
person
's
BAC
is
not
at
or
above
the
legal
limit
of
0.00
%
,
they
will
probably
be
released
without
any
charges
.

One
may
,
however
,
still
be
charged
with
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
on
the
basis
of
driving
symptoms
,
observed
impairment
,
admissions
or
performance
on
the
field
sobriety
tests
.

And
if
there
is
suspicion
of
drug
usage
,
a
blood
or
urine
test
is
likely
,
or
at
least
the
testimony
of
a
specially-trained
officer
called
a
Drug
Recognition
Expert
(
DRE
)
.

Assuming
sufficient
evidence
of
impaired
driving
from
drugs
,
the
arrested
may
face
charges
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
the
combined
influence
of
alcohol
and
drugs
.

Most
of
the
time
,
the
driver
will
either
be
kept
in
a
holding
cell
(
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
"
drunk
tank
"
)
until
they
are
deemed
sober
enough
to
be
released
on
bail
or
on
his
"
own
recognizance
"
(
"
O.R.
"
)
.

A
date
to
appear
in
court
for
an
arraignment
will
be
given
to
them
.

If
they
can
not
make
bail
or
is
not
granted
O.R.
,
they
will
be
kept
in
jail
to
wait
for
the
arraignment
on
remand
.

Interventions
Drunk
driving
is
a
public
health
concern
in
the
United
States
,
and
reducing
its
frequency
may
require
an
integrated
community-based
approach
utilizing
sanctions
and
treatments
.

Several
intervention
programs
have
been
developed
,
such
as
the
Paradigm
Developmental
Model
of
Treatment
(
PDMT
)
,
a
program
encouraging
a
paradigm
shift
in
the
offender
's
view
of
oneself
and
the
world
.

The
National
Institute
for
Alcohol
Abuse
and
Alcoholism
suggests
environmental
interventions
to
help
eliminate
drinking
and
driving
all
together
.

To
date
,
the
most
successful
law
in
combating
drinking
and
driving
has
been
raising
the
minimum
drinking
age
to
00
(
NIAAA
,
0000
)
.

NHTSA
estimates
that
a
legal
drinking
age
of
00
saves
000
to
0,000
lives
annually
.

Since
0000
,
these
laws
have
prevented
more
than
00,000
traffic
deaths
.

Other
suggestions
include
raising
taxes
,
enacting
zero-tolerance
laws
,
stepping
up
enforcement
,
school-based
prevention
programs
,
and
family
based
prevention
programs
(
NIAAA
)
.

International
comparisons
In
countries
such
as
the
United
Kingdom
and
Australia
drunk
driving
and
deaths
caused
by
drunk
driving
are
considerably
lower
than
the
USA
.

Drunk
driving
deaths
in
the
UK
(
population
00
million
,
00
million
cars
)
were
000
in
0000
(
00
%
of
all
fatal
accidents
)
.

In
California
(
population
00
million
,
00
million
cars
)
there
were
0,000
deaths
from
traffic
accidents
related
to
"
alcohol
or
other
drugs
"
in
0000
(
00
%
of
all
fatal
accidents
)
.

Alcohol
consumption
per
capita
in
the
UK
and
Australia
is
higher
than
the
US
and
the
legal
age
for
drinking
lower
.

<
Research
in
the
United
Kingdom
has
shown
that
the
danger
group
for
drunk
driving
is
young
men
in
their
early
00s
rather
than
teenagers
.

It
is
not
uncommon
for
police
forces
in
Australia
to
randomly
stop
motorists
and
submit
them
to
a
Random
breath
test
.

This
test
involves
speaking
or
blowing
into
a
hand
held
device
to
give
a
reading
.

Refusing
a
roadside
test
is
an
offense
,
and
is
subject
to
the
same
penalty
as
high
range
drunk
driving
.

This
detection
method
is
not
employed
in
the
UK
,
and
it
is
not
an
offence
for
a
fully
licenced
driver
to
drive
with
a
BAC
of
less
than
0.00
%
(
which
it
is
in
Australia
)
.

Also
in
Australia
it
is
an
offence
for
any
person
driving
on
Learner
or
probationary
(
'
P0
or
P0
'
)
plates
(
aged
under
00years
)
to
drive
with
any
alcohol
at
all
in
your
system
.

The
BAC
must
be
0.00
%
and
still
remains
under
0.00
%
for
an
"
instructing
a
learner
"
.

Unlike
the
USA
these
countries
do
not
see
restricting
access
to
alcohol
as
having
any
useful
role
to
play
in
reducing
drunk
driving
.

Their
experience
is
that
random
breath
tests
,
severe
penalties
,
including
imprisonment
for
a
first
offense
(
in
UK
)
,
combined
with
blanket
public
service
broadcasting
are
a
more
effective
strategy
.

Australian
and
British
Law
also
does
not
recognize
the
crime
of
DUI
Manslaughter
and
sentences
for
causing
death
by
drunk
driving
are
much
lower
than
the
USA
.

In
the
UK
,
a
judge
makes
a
sentencing
decision
based
on
the
amount
of
alcohol
present
.

This
can
lead
to
imprisonment
for
a
first
offence
.

In
Australia
,
while
they
differ
slightly
from
state
to
state
,
the
penalties
are
more
or
less
set
depending
on
the
range
of
BAC
detected
.

For
example
over
0.00
%
and
under
0.00
%
BAC
does
not
lead
to
any
licence
restriction
for
any
period
of
time
(
fine
only
)
.

Over
0.00
%
means
at
least
0
month
driving
ban
and
fine
for
a
first
offence
(
this
climbs
as
the
BAC
reading
climbs
)
.

Over
0.00
%
is
at
least
0
months
driving
ban
and
larger
fine
(
over
$
0000
)
for
a
first
offence
.

In
the
latter
case
the
drivers
licence
is
revoked
and
they
must
re
sit
a
driving
test
(
after
the
ban
is
completed
)
and
provide
liver
function
test
(
LFT
's
)
results
that
show
that
they
are
not
consuming
alcohol
above
a
low
range
.

In
Germany
,
a
legal
limit
of
0.00
%
lowers
to
0.00
%
if
found
to
be
at
fault
in
a
traffic
accident
and
0.00
%
is
the
standard
for
those
who
are
under
00
years
of
age
.

Uluru
(
)
,
also
known
as
Ayers
Rock
,
is
a
large
sandstone
rock
formation
in
the
southern
part
of
the
Northern
Territory
,
central
Australia
.

It
lies
south
west
of
the
nearest
large
town
,
Alice
Springs
,
by
road
.

Kata
Tjuta
and
Uluru
are
the
two
major
features
of
the
Uluṟu-Kata
Tjuṯa
National
Park
.

Uluru
is
sacred
to
the
Anangu
,
the
Aboriginal
people
of
the
area
.

The
area
around
the
formation
is
home
to
a
plethora
of
springs
,
waterholes
,
rock
caves
and
ancient
paintings
.

Uluru
is
listed
as
a
World
Heritage
Site
.

Name
The
local
Pitjantjatjara
people
call
the
landmark
(
)
.

This
word
has
no
further
particular
meaning
in
the
Pitjantjatjara
language
,
although
it
is
used
as
a
local
family
name
by
the
senior
Traditional
Owners
of
Uluru
.

On
00
July
0000
,
the
surveyor
William
Gosse
sighted
the
landmark
and
named
it
Ayers
Rock
in
honour
of
the
then
Chief
Secretary
of
South
Australia
,
Sir
Henry
Ayers
.

Since
then
,
both
names
have
been
used
.

In
0000
,
a
dual
naming
policy
was
adopted
that
allowed
official
names
that
consist
of
both
the
traditional
Aboriginal
name
and
the
English
name
.

On
00
December
0000
,
it
was
renamed
"
Ayers
Rock
/
Uluru
"
and
became
the
first
official
dual-named
feature
in
the
Northern
Territory
.

The
order
of
the
dual
names
was
officially
reversed
to
"
Uluru
/
Ayers
Rock
"
on
0
November
0000
following
a
request
from
the
Regional
Tourism
Association
in
Alice
Springs
.

Description
Uluru
is
one
of
Australia
's
most
recognisable
natural
landmarks
.

The
sandstone
formation
stands
high
,
rising
above
sea
level
,
with
most
of
its
bulk
lying
underground
,
and
has
a
total
circumference
of
.

Both
Uluru
and
the
nearby
Kata
Tjuta
formation
have
great
cultural
significance
for
the
people
,
the
traditional
inhabitants
of
the
area
,
who
lead
walking
tours
to
inform
visitors
about
the
local
flora
and
fauna
,
bush
foods
and
the
Aboriginal
dreamtime
stories
of
the
area
.

Uluru
is
notable
for
appearing
to
change
colour
at
different
times
of
the
day
and
year

Geology
Uluru
is
an
inselberg
,
literally
"
island
mountain
"
.

An
inselberg
is
a
prominent
isolated
residual
knob
or
hill
that
rises
abruptly
from
and
is
surrounded
by
extensive
and
relatively
flat
erosion
lowlands
in
a
hot
,
dry
region
.

Uluru
is
also
often
referred
to
as
a
monolith
,
although
this
is
a
somewhat
ambiguous
term
that
is
generally
avoided
by
geologists
.

The
remarkable
feature
of
Uluru
is
its
homogeneity
and
lack
of
jointing
and
parting
at
bedding
surfaces
,
leading
to
the
lack
of
development
of
scree
slopes
and
soil
.

These
characteristics
led
to
its
survival
,
while
the
surrounding
rocks
were
eroded
.

For
the
purpose
of
mapping
and
describing
the
geological
history
of
the
area
,
geologists
refer
to
the
rock
strata
making
up
Uluru
as
the
Mutitjulu
Arkose
,
and
it
is
one
of
many
sedimentary
formations
filling
the
Amadeus
Basin
.

Composition
Uluru
is
dominantly
composed
of
coarse-grained
arkose
(
a
type
of
sandstone
characterized
by
an
abundance
of
feldspar
)
and
some
conglomerate
.

Average
composition
is
00
%
feldspar
,
00
–
00
%
quartz
and
up
to
00
%
rock
fragments
;
most
feldspar
is
K-feldspar
with
only
minor
plagioclase
as
subrounded
grains
and
highly
altered
inclusions
within
K-feldspar
.

The
grains
are
typically
in
diameter
,
and
are
angular
to
subangular
;
the
finer
sandstone
is
well
sorted
,
with
sorting
decreasing
with
increasing
grain
size
.

The
rock
fragments
include
subrounded
basalt
,
invariably
replaced
to
various
degrees
by
chlorite
and
epidote
.

The
minerals
present
suggest
derivation
from
a
predominantly
granite
source
,
similar
to
the
Musgrave
Block
exposed
to
the
south
.

When
relatively
fresh
,
the
rock
has
a
grey
colour
,
but
weathering
of
iron-bearing
minerals
by
the
process
of
oxidation
gives
the
outer
surface
layer
of
rock
a
red-brown
rusty
colour
.

Features
related
to
deposition
of
the
sediment
include
cross-bedding
and
ripples
,
analysis
of
which
indicated
deposition
from
broad
shallow
high
energy
fluvial
channels
and
sheet
flooding
,
typical
of
alluvial
fan
s.
Age
and
origin
The
Mutitjulu
Arkose
is
believed
to
be
of
about
the
same
age
as
the
conglomerate
at
Kata
Tjuta
,
and
to
have
a
similar
origin
despite
the
rock
type
being
different
,
but
it
is
younger
than
the
rocks
exposed
to
the
east
at
Mount
Conner
,
and
unrelated
to
them
.

The
strata
at
Uluru
are
nearly
vertical
,
dipping
to
the
south
west
at
00
°
,
and
have
an
exposed
thickness
of
at
least
.

The
strata
dip
below
the
surrounding
plain
and
no
doubt
extend
well
beyond
Uluru
in
the
subsurface
,
but
the
extent
is
not
known
.

The
rock
was
originally
sand
,
deposited
as
part
of
an
extensive
alluvial
fan
that
extended
out
from
the
ancestors
of
the
Musgrave
,
Mann
and
Petermann
Ranges
to
the
south
and
west
,
but
separate
from
a
nearby
fan
that
deposited
the
sand
,
pebbles
and
cobbles
that
now
make
up
Kata
Tjuta
.

The
similar
mineral
composition
of
the
Mutitjulu
Arkose
and
the
granite
ranges
to
the
south
is
now
explained
.

The
ancestors
of
the
ranges
to
the
south
were
once
much
larger
than
the
eroded
remnants
we
see
today
.

They
were
thrust
up
during
a
mountain
building
episode
referred
to
as
the
Petermann
Orogeny
that
took
place
in
late
Neoproterozoic
to
early
Cambrian
times
(
000-000
Ma
)
,
and
thus
the
Mutitjulu
Arkose
is
believed
to
have
been
deposited
at
about
the
same
time
.

The
arkose
sandstone
which
makes
up
the
formation
is
composed
of
grains
that
show
little
sorting
based
on
grain
size
,
exhibit
very
little
rounding
and
the
feldspars
in
the
rock
are
relatively
fresh
in
appearance
.

This
lack
of
sorting
and
grain
rounding
is
typical
of
arkosic
sandstones
and
is
indicative
of
relatively
rapid
erosion
from
the
granites
of
the
growing
mountains
to
the
south
.

The
layers
of
sand
were
nearly
horizontal
when
deposited
,
but
were
tilted
to
their
near
vertical
position
during
a
later
episode
of
mountain
building
,
possibly
the
Alice
Springs
Orogeny
of
Palaeozoic
age
(
000-000
Ma
)
.

Fauna
and
flora
Historically
,
00
species
of
native

are
known
to
have
been
living
near
Uluru
;
according
to
recent
surveys
there
are
currently
00

acknowledge
that
a
decrease
in
the
number
has
implications
for
the
condition
and
health
of
the
landscape
.

Moves
are
supported
for
the
reintroduction
of
locally
extinct
animals
such
as
Malleefowl
,
Common
Brushtail
Possum
,
Rufous
hare-wallaby
or
Mala
,
Bilby
,
Burrowing
Bettong
and
the
Black-flanked
Rock-wallaby
.

The
Mulgara
,
the
only
mammal
listed
as
vulnerable
,
is
mostly
restricted
to
the
transitional
sand
plain
area
,
a
narrow
band
of
country
that
stretches
from
the
vicinity
of
Uluru
to
the
Northern
boundary
of
the
park
and
into
Ayers
Rock
Resort
.

This
area
also
contains
the
marsupial
mole
,
Woma
Python
and
Great
Desert
Skink
.

The
bat
population
of
the
park
comprises
at
least
seven
species
that
depend
on
day
roosting
sites
within
caves
and
crevices
of
Uluru
and
Kata
Tjuta
.

Most
of
the
bats
forage
for
aerial
prey
within
or
so
from
the
rock
face
.

The
park
has
a
very
rich
reptile
fauna
of
high
conservation
significance
with
00
species
having
been
reliably
recorded
.

Four
species
of
frog
are
abundant
at

confined
to
the
Red
Kangaroo
,
Bush
Turkey
,
Emu
and
lizard
s
such
as
the
Sand

.

Of
the
00
mammal
species
found
in
the
park
,
six
are
introduced
:
the
house
mouse
,
camel
,
fox
,
cat
,
dog
and
rabbit
.

These
species
are
distributed
throughout
the
park
but
their
densities
are
greatest
near
the
rich
water
run-off
areas
of
Uluru
and
Kata
Tjuta
.

Uluru
–
Kata
Tjuta
National
Park
flora
represents
a
large
portion
of
plants
found
in
Central
Australia
.

A
number
of
these
species
are
considered
rare
and
restricted
in
the
park
or
the
immediate
region
.

There
are
many
rare
and
endemic
plants
in
the
park
.

The
growth
and
reproduction
of
plant
communities
rely
on
irregular
rainfall
.

Some
plants
are
able
to
survive
fire
and
some
are
dependent
on
it
to
reproduce
.

Plants
are
an
important
part
of
Tjukurpa
,
and
there
are
ceremonies
for
each
of
the
major
plant
foods
.

Many
plants
are
associated
with
ancestral
beings
.

Flora
in
Uluru
–
Kata
Tjuta
National
Park
can
be
broken
into
the
following
categories
:
Trees
such
as
the
Mulga
and
Centralian
Bloodwood
are
used
to
make
tools
such
as
spearheads
,
boomerang
s
and
bowls
.

The
red
sap
of
the
bloodwood
is
used
as
a
disinfectant
and
an
inhalant
for
coughs
and
colds
.

There
are
several
rare
and
endangered
species
in
the
park
.

Most
of
them
,
like
Adder
's
Tongue
ferns
,
are
restricted
to
the
moist
areas
at
the
base
of
the
formation
,
which
are
areas
of
high
visitor
use
and
subject
to
erosion
.

Since
the
first
Europeans
arrived
,
00
exotic
plant
species
have
been
recorded
in
the
park
,
representing
about
0.0
%
of
the
total
park
flora
.

Some
,
such
as
perennial
buffel
grass
(
Cenchrus
ciliaris
)
,
were
introduced
to
rehabilitate
areas
damaged
by
erosion
.

It
is
the
most
threatening
weed
in
the
park
and
has
spread
to
invade
water
-
and
nutrient-rich
drainage
lines
.

A
few
others
,
such
as
burrgrass
,
were
brought
in
accidentally
,
carried
on
cars
and
people
.

Climate

Local
Aboriginal

recognise
five
seasons
:
Myths
,
legends
and
Aboriginal
traditions
According
to
the
,
traditional
landowners
of
Uluru
:
There
are
a
number
of
differing
accounts
given
,
by
outsiders
,
of
Aboriginal
ancestral
stories
for
the
origins
of
Uluru
and
its
many
cracks
and
fissures
.

One
such
account
,
taken
from
Robert
Layton
's
(
0000
)
Uluru
:
An
Aboriginal
history
of
Ayers
Rock
,
reads
as
follows
:
Two
other
accounts
are
given
in
Norbert
Brockman
's
(
0000
)
Encyclopedia
of
Sacred
Places
.

The
first
tells
of
serpent
beings
who
waged
many
wars
around
Uluru
,
scarring
the
rock
.

The
second
tells
of
two
tribes
of
ancestral
spirits
who
were
invited
to
a
feast
,
but
were
distracted
by
the
beautiful
Sleepy
Lizard
Women
and
did
not
show
up
.

In
response
,
the
angry
hosts
sang
evil
into
a
mud
sculpture
that
came
to
life
as
the
dingo
.

There
followed
a
great
battle
,
which
ended
in
the
deaths
of
the
leaders
of
both
tribes
.

The
earth
itself
rose
up
in
grief
at
the
bloodshed
,
becoming
Uluru
.

The
Commonwealth
Department
of
Environment
's
webpage
advises
:
It
is
sometimes
reported
that
those
who
take
rocks
from
the
formation
will
be
cursed
and
suffer
misfortune
.

There
have
been
many
instances
where
people
who
removed
such
rocks
attempted
to
mail
them
back
to
various
agencies
in
an
attempt
to
remove
the
perceived
curse
.

History
Archaeological
findings
to
the
east
and
west
indicate
that
humans
settled
in
the
area
more
than
00,000
years
ago
.

Europeans
arrived
in
the
Australian
Western
Desert
in
the
0000s
.

Uluru
and
Kata
Tjuta
were
first
mapped
by
Europeans
in
0000
during
the
expeditionary
period
made
possible
by
the
construction
of
the
Australian
Overland
Telegraph
Line
.

In
separate
expeditions
,
Ernest
Giles
and
William
Gosse
were
the
first
European
explorers
to
this
area
.

While
exploring
the
area
in
0000
,
Giles
sighted
Kata
Tjuta
from
a
location
near
Kings
Canyon
and
called
it
Mount
Olga
,
while
the
following
year
Gosse
observed
Uluru
and
named
it
Ayers
Rock
,
in
honour
of
the
Chief
Secretary
of
South
Australia
,
Sir
Henry
Ayers
.

Further
explorations
followed
with
the
aim
of
establishing
the
possibilities
of
the
area
for
pastoralism
.

In
the
late
00th
century
,
pastoralists
attempted
to
establish
themselves
in
areas
adjoining
the
South
western/Petermann
Reserve
and
interaction
between
and
white
people
became
more
frequent
and
more
violent
.

Due
to
the
effects
of
grazing
and
drought
,
bush
food
stores
became
depleted
.

Competition
for
these
resources
created
conflict
between
the
two
groups
,
resulting
in
more
frequent
police
patrols
.

Later
,
during
the
depression
in
the
0000s
,
became
involved
in
dingo
scalping
with
'
doggers
'
who
introduced
to
European
foods
and
ways
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
large
adjoining
areas
of
South
Australia
,
Western
Australia
and
Northern
Territory
were
declared
as
Aboriginal
reserves
,
sanctuaries
for
nomadic
people
who
had
virtually
no
contact
with
European
settlers
.

In
0000
,
part
of
Uluru
–
Kata
Tjuta
National
Park
was
declared
an
Aboriginal
Reserve
(
commonly
known
as
the
South-Western
or
Petermann
Reserve
)
by
the
Australian
government
under
the
Aboriginals
Ordinance
.

The
first
tourists
arrived
in
the
Uluru
area
in
0000
.

Beginning
in
the
0000s
,
permanent
European
settlement
of
the
area
for
reasons
of
the
Aboriginal
welfare
policy
and
to
help
promote
tourism
of
Uluru
.

This
increased
tourism
prompted
the
formation
of
the
first
vehicular
tracks
in
0000
and
tour
bus
services
began
early
in
the
following
decade
.

In
0000
,
the
area
that
would
become
the
Uluru
–
Kata
Tjuta
National
Park
was
excised
from
the
Petermann
Reserve
;
it
was
placed
under
the
management
of
the
Northern
Territory
Reserves
Board
and
named
the
Ayers
Rock
–
Mount
Olga
National
Park
.

The
first
ranger
was
Bill
Harney
,
a
well-recognised
central
Australian
figure
.

By
0000
,
the
first
motel
leases
had
been
granted
and
Eddie
Connellan
had
constructed
an
airstrip
close
to
the
northern
side
of
Uluru
.

On
0
March
0000
,
a
three-seat
Bell
00
G0
helicopter
piloted
by
Philip
Latz
crashed
on
Uluru
,
about
east
of
the
cairn
.

The
wreck
was
lifted
off
on
00
March
by
a
Sikorsky
S00
helicopter
.

On
00
October
0000
,
the
Australian
government
returned
ownership
of
Uluru
to
the
local
Pitjantjatjara
Aborigines
,
with
one
of
the
conditions
being
that
the
would
lease
it
back
to
the
National
Parks
and
Wildlife
agency
for
00
years
and
that
it
would
be
jointly
managed
.

The
agreement
originally
made
between
the
community
and
Prime
Minister
Bob
Hawke
that
the
climb
to
the
top
by
tourists
would
be
stopped
was
broken
.

The
Aboriginal
community
of
Mutitjulu
,
population
of
approximately
000
,
is
located
near
the
eastern
end
of
Uluru
.

From
Uluru
it
is
by
road
to
the
tourist
town
of
Yulara
,
population
0,000
,
which
is
situated
just
outside
of
the
national
park
.

The
00th
anniversary
of
the
handback
of
title
was
celebrated
on
00
October
0000
.

On
0
October
0000
,
the
Talinguru
Nyakuntjaku
viewing
area
opened
to
public
visitation
.

The
A$
00
million
project
about
on
the
east
side
of
Uluru
involved
design
and
construction
supervision
by
the
traditional
owners
,
with
of
roads
and
of
walking
trails
being
built
for
the
area
.

Tourism
The
development
of
tourism
infrastructure
adjacent
to
the
base
of
Uluru
that
began
in
the
0000s
soon
produced
adverse
environmental
impacts
.

It
was
decided
in
the
early
0000s
to
remove
all
accommodation-related
tourist
facilities
and
re-establish
them
outside
the
park
.

In
0000
,
a
reservation
of
of
land
beyond
the
park
's
northern
boundary
,
from
Uluru
,
was
approved
for
the
development
of
a
tourist
facility
and
an
associated
airport
,
to
be
known
as
Yulara
.

The
camp
ground
within
the
park
was
closed
in
0000
and
the
motels
closed
in
late
0000
,
coinciding
with
the
opening
of
the
Yulara
resort
.

In
0000
,
the
majority
interest
in
the
Yulara
resort
held
by
the
Northern
Territory
Government
was
sold
and
the
resort
was
renamed
Ayers
Rock
Resort
.

Since
the
park
was
listed
as
a
World
Heritage
Site
,
annual
visitor
numbers
rose
to
over
000,000
visitors
by
the
year
0000
.

Increased
tourism
provides
regional
and
national
economic
benefits
.

It
also
presents
an
ongoing
challenge
to
balance
conservation
of
cultural
values
and
visitor
needs
.

Admission
Admission
to
the
park
costs
A$

in
0000
and
extended
in
0000
makes
the
hour-long
climb
easier
,
but
it
is
still
a
long
(
)
and
steep
hike
to
the
top
,
where
it
can
be
quite
windy
.

It
is
recommended
individuals
drink
plenty
of
water
whilst
climbing
,
and
those
who
are
unfit
,
suffer
from
vertigo
or
medical
conditions
restricting
exercise
,
do
not
attempt
it
.

Climbing
Uluru
is
generally
closed
to
the
public
when
high
winds
are
recorded
at
the
top
.

There
have
been
at
least
00
deaths
relating
to
recreational
climbing
since
such
incidents
began
being
recorded
.

The
local
do
not
climb
Uluru
because
of
its
great
spiritual
significance
.

They
request
that
visitors
do
not
climb
the
rock
,
partly
due
to
the
path
crossing
a
sacred
traditional
Dreamtime
track
,
and
also
due
to
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
safety
of
visitors
.

The
visitors
guide
says
"
the
climb
is
not
prohibited
,
but
we
prefer
that
,
as
a
guest
on
land
,
you
will
choose
to
respect
our
law
and
culture
by
not
climbing
.
"

On
00
December
0000
,
Prime
Minister
Bob
Hawke
promised
to
hand
back
the
land
title
to
the
traditional
custodians
and
caretakers
and
agreed
to
the
community
's
00-point
plan
which
included
forbidding
the
climbing
of
Uluru
.

However
,
the
government
set
access
to
climb
Uluru
and
a
00-year
lease
,
instead
of
the
previously
agreed
upon
00-year
lease
,
as
conditions
before
the
title
was
officially
given
back
to
the
.

In
0000
,
the
Australian
government
indicated
that
climbing
Uluru
may
no
longer
be
allowed
under
the
proposed
"
Draft
Management
Plan
0000
–
0000
"
.

The
public
has
been
invited
to
comment
on
the
plan
prior
to
submission
to
the
Minister
for
the
Environment
.

Several
controversial
incidents
in
0000
,
including
a
striptease
,
golfing
and
nudity
on
top
of
Uluru
,
have
led
to
renewed
calls
for
banning
the
climb
.

Photography
The
also
request
that
visitors
do
not
photograph
certain
sections
of
Uluru
,
for
reasons
related
to
traditional
Tjukurpa
beliefs
.

These
areas
are
the
sites
of
gender-linked
rituals
,
and
are
forbidden
ground
for
of
the
opposite
sex
to
those
participating
in
the
rituals
in
question
.

The
photographic
ban
is
intended
to
prevent
from
inadvertently
violating
this
taboo
by
encountering
photographs
of
the
forbidden
sites
in
the
outside

Manumission
is
the
act
of
a
slave
owner
freeing
his
or
her
slaves
.

Different
approaches
developed
,
each
specific
to
the
time
and
place
of
a
society
's
slave
system
.

The
motivations
of
slave
owners
in
manumitting
slaves
were
complex
and
varied
.

Firstly
,
manumission
may
present
itself
as
a
sentimental
and
benevolent
gesture
.

One
typical
scenario
was
the
freeing
in
the
master
's
will
of
a
devoted
servant
after
long
years
of
service
.

This
kind
of
manumission
generally
was
restricted
to
slaves
who
had
some
degree
of
intimacy
with
their
masters
,
such
as
those
serving
as
personal
attendants
,
household
servants
,
secretaries
and
the
like
.

In
some
cases
,
master
and
slave
had
had
a
long-term
sexual
relationship
.

Owners
sometimes
freed
the
woman
and
children
born
of
such
relationships
.

While
a
trusted
bailiff
might
be
manumitted
as
a
gesture
of
gratitude
,
for
those
working
as
agricultural
labourers
or
in
workshops
,
there
was
little
likelihood
of
being
so
noticed
.

Such
feelings
of
benevolence
may
have
been
of
value
to
slave
owners
themselves
as
it
allowed
them
to
focus
on
a
'
humane
component
'
in
the
human
traffic
of
slavery
.

In
general
,
it
was
more
common
for
older
slaves
to
be
given
freedom
,
once
they
had
reached
the
age
where
they
were
beginning
to
be
less
useful
.

Legislation
under
the
early
Roman
empire
put
limits
on
the
number
of
slaves
that
could
be
freed
in
wills
(
Fufio-Caninian
law
0
BC
)
,
which
suggests
that
it
had
been
widely
used
.

Freeing
slaves
could
serve
the
pragmatic
interests
of
the
owner
.

The
prospect
of
manumission
worked
as
an
incentive
for
slaves
to
be
industrious
and
compliant
.

Roman
slaves
were
paid
a
wage
(
pecunium
)
with
which
they
could
save
up
to
,
in
effect
,
buy
themselves
.

Manumission
contracts
found
in
some
abundance
at
Delphi
specify
in
detail
the
prerequisites
for
liberation
.

Ancient
Greece
Greek
slaves
generally
became
metics
upon
being
manumitted
.

That
is
,
they
became
resident
aliens
,
non-citizens
in
the
city
where
they
lived
.

Their
freedom
was
not
absolute
.

At
Athens
,
freeborn
metics
were
required
to
nominate
a
sponsor
or
patron
(
prostates
)
:
in
the
case
of
freed
slaves
,
this
was
automatically
their
former
master
.

This
relationship
entailed
some
degree
of
continuing
duty
to
the
master
.

Failure
to
perform
the
duty
could
lead
to
prosecution
at
law
and
re-enslavement
.

Continuing
duties
specified
for
freed
slaves
in
manumission
agreements
became
more
common
into
the
Hellenistic
era
,
and
they
may
have
been
customary
earlier
.

Sometimes
extra
payments
were
specified
by
which
a
freed
slave
could
liberate
himself
from
these
residual
duties
.

Freed
persons
were
commonly
required
to
live
nearby
the
former
master
(
paramone
)
.

As
ex-slaves
risked
beatings
for
failing
to
meet
the
continuing
duties
,
their
freedom
was
limited
.

But
ex-slaves
were
able
to
own
property
outright
,
and
their
children
were
free
of
all
constraint
.

Children
born
into
slavery
were
also
considered
the
property
of
the
master
.

Free
individuals
could
be
subject
to
paramone
.

Ancient
Rome
Under
Roman
law
,
a
slave
had
no
personhood
and
was
protected
under
law
mainly
as
his
master
's
property
.

In
ancient
Rome
,
a
slave
who
had
been
manumitted
was
a
libertus
(
feminine
liberta
)
and
a
citizen
.

A
freedman
customarily
took
his
former
owner
's
family
name
,
that
is
,
the
nomen
(
see
Roman
naming
conventions
)
of
his
master
's
gens
.

The
former
owner
became
his
patron
(
patronus
)
.
As
a
client
(
cliens
)
,
the
freedman
retained
certain
obligations
to
his
master
,
who
in
turn
owed
mutual
favors
.

A
freedman
could
also
acquire
multiple
patrons
.

A
freedman
became
a
citizen
.

Not
all
citizens
,
however
,
held
the
same
rights
and
privileges
(
women
were
citizens
,
but
could
not
vote
or
hold
public
office
;
see
Roman
citizenship
)
.

The
former
slave
's
rights
were
limited
or
defined
by
particular
statutes
.
Freedmen
could
become
civil
servants
but
not
hold
the
higher
magistracies
(
see
for
instance
apparitor
and
scriba
)
,
priests
of
the
emperor
,
and
hold
other
highly
respected
public
positions
.

If
they
were
sharp
businessmen
(
or
in
some
cases
businesswomen
)
,
there
were
no
social
limits
to
the
wealth
they
could
amass
.

The
children
of
a
freedman
held
full
legal
rights
,
though
Roman
society
was
stratified
.

One
of
the
most
famous
Romans
to
have
been
the
son
of
a
freedman
was
the
poet
Horace
,
who
enjoyed
the
patronage
of
Augustus
.

A
notable
character
of
Latin
literature
is
Trimalchio
,
the
ostentatiously
nouveau
riche
freedman
in
the
Satyricon
of
Petronius
.

Jewish
manumission
laws
Judaism
was
one
of
the
oldest
religions
to
legislate
laws
of
manumission
.

Manumission
of
a
Canaanite
slave
was
seen
as
a
religious
conversion
,
and
involved
a
second
immersion
in
a
ritual
bath
(
mikveh
)
.

The
Talmud
made
many
rulings
which
had
the
effect
of
making
manumission
easier
and
more
likely
.

The
costly
giving
of
gifts
,
on
the
occasion
of
manumission
,
is
mandated
in
the
Bible
related
to
the
automatic
0th-year
manumission
.

The
price
to
buy
freedom
was
set
as
the
total
fee
for
a
hired
servant
,
over
the
outstanding
period
of
service
.

The
classical
rabbis
changed
the
price
to
be
the
original
price
for
which
the
servant
was
purchased
,
pro-rated
for
the
amount
of
service
already
worked
.

If
the
servant
had
become
weak
or
sickly
,
and
worth
less
in
the
market
,
the
price
of
freedom
was
to
be
reduced
further
.

The
rabbis
ruled
the
price
could
never
be
higher
than
the
original
one
,
regardless
of
any
increase
in
strength
or
skills
by
a
servant
.

United
States
North
American
colonies
had
rules
for
manumission
passed
by
their
legislatures
,
and
African
slaves
were
freed
in
the
colonies
as
early
as
the
seventeenth
century
.

Some
went
on
to
become
landowners
and
slaveholders
in
the
colonies
.

Slaves
could
sometimes
arrange
manumission
by
agreeing
to
"
purchase
themselves
"
;
that
is
,
to
pay
the
master
an
agreed
amount
.

Some
masters
demanded
market
rates
;
others
set
a
lower
amount
in
consideration
of
service
.

After
the
American
Revolutionary
War
individual
states
established
laws
governing
this
transaction
and
tended
to
make
it
easier
to
accomplish
.

In
the
first
two
decades
after
the
American
Revolution
,
many
of
the
new
states
passed
laws
allowing
slaveholders
to
declare
slaves
free
by
filing
papers
,
and
numerous
manumissions
were
made
in
the
idealism
of
the
war
.

The
percentage
of
free
blacks
as
a
proportion
of
the
total
black
population
increased
in
the
Upper
South
from
less
than
0
percent
to
nearly
00
percent
in
this
period
.

Together
with
several
northern
states
abolishing
slavery
during
this
period
,
the
percentage
of
free
blacks
nationally
increased
to
00.0
percent
of
the
total
black
population
.

After
invention
of
the
cotton
gin
in
0000
,
which
enabled
the
development
of
extensive
new
areas
for
new
types
of
cotton
cultivation
,
manumissions
decreased
due
to
increased
demand
for
slave
labor
.

In
the
nineteenth
century
,
slave
revolts
such
as
the
Haitian
Revolution
and
especially
the
0000
rebellion
led
by
Nat
Turner
increased
slaveholder
fears
,
and
most
southern
states
passed
laws
making
manumission
nearly
impossible
until
the
passage
of
the
Thirteenth
Amendment
to
the
United
States
Constitution
,
which
abolished
slavery
after
the
American
Civil
War
in
0000
.

In
the
Upper
South
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
,
planters
had
less
need
for
slaves
as
they
switched
from
labor-intensive
tobacco
cultivation
to
mixed-crop
farming
.
Slave
states
such
as
Virginia
made
it
easier
for
slaveholders
to
free
their
slaves
.

In
the
two
decades
following
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
numerous
slaveholders
accomplished
manumissions
by
deed
or
in
wills
,
so
that
the
percentage
of
free
blacks
to
the
total
number
of
blacks
rose
from
less
than
one
percent
to
00
percent
in
the
Upper
South
.

Some
northern
states
quickly
abolished
slavery
,
adding
to
the
national
population
of
free
blacks
;
New
York
and
New
Jersey
adopted
gradual
abolition
laws
that
kept
the
free
children
of
slaves
as
indentured
servants
into
their
twenties
.

Of
the
Founding
Fathers
of
the
United
States
as
defined
by
the
historian
Richard
B.
Morris
,
the
southerners
were
the
major
slaveholders
,
but
northerners
also
held
them
,
in
generally
fewer
number
,
as
domestic
servants
.

John
Adams
owned
none
;
George
Washington
freed
his
slaves
in
his
will
(
his
wife
independently
held
numerous
dower
slaves
)
;
Thomas
Jefferson
freed
five
slaves
in
his
will
,
and
the
remaining
000
were
sold
to
settle
his
estate
debts
;
James
Madison
did
not
free
his
slaves
but
some
were
sold
to
pay
off
estate
debts
,
and
his
wife
and
son
retained
most
to
work
Montpelier
plantation
;
Benjamin
Franklin
freed
his
slaves
;
Alexander
Hamilton
likely
owned
slaves
and
freed
them
,
as
he
was
an
officer
of
the
New
York
Manumission
Society
;
the
society
was
founded
by
John
Jay
,
who
freed
his
domestic
slaves
in
0000
,
the
same
year
as
governor
he
signed
a
gradual
abolition
law
in
New
York
;
John
Dickinson
freed
his
slaves
in
a
manumission
process
between
0000-0000
,
the
only
Founding
Father
to
do
so
during
this
time
.

Purchase

The
land
in
question
had
been
previously
ceded
to
Massachusetts
from
the
state
of
New
York
under
the
0000
Treaty
of
Hartford
.

The
pre-emption
right
gave
them
the
first
or
preemptive
right
to
obtain
clear
title
to
this
land
from
the
Indians
.

They
soon
extinguished
the
Indian
title
to
the
portion
of
the
land
east
of
the
Genesee
River
,
as
well
as
a
tract
west
of
the
Genesee
The
Mill
Yard
Tract
)
,
surveyed
all
of
it
,
laid
out
townships
,
and
sold
large
parts
to
speculators
and
settlers
.

Nathaniel
Gorham
,
Jr.
,
(
died
October
00
,
0000
,
Canandaigua
,
New
York
)
was
a
pioneer
settler
of
this
tract
,
having
been
placed
in
charge
of
his
father
's
interests
there
.

In
0000
,
after
Gorham
and
Phelps
defaulted
in
payment
,
they
sold
nearly
all
of
their
unsold
lands
east
of
the
Genesee
to
Robert
Morris
,
who
eventually
resold
those
lands
to
The
Pulteney
Association
.

Phelps
and
Gorham
were
unable
to
fulfill
their
contract
in
full
to
Massachusetts
,
so
in
0000
,
they
surrendered
back
to
Massachusetts
that
portion
of
the
lands
which
remained
under
the
Indian
title
,
namely
,
the
land
west
of
the
Genesee
.

It
also
was
eventually
acquired
by
Robert
Morris
,
who
resold
most
of
it
to
The
Holland
Land
Company
.

Morris
did
keep
for
himself
,
and
that
land
became
known
as
The

the
Red

expansion
,
which

Gameplay
Operation
Flashpoint
's
gameplay
varies
significantly
depending
on
the
player
's
role
,
but
the
game
is
best
described
as
a
tactical
shooter
with
significant
vehicle
elements
and
minor
real-time
tactics
elements
.

OFP
's
gameplay
is
largely
team
oriented
and
the
player
spends
much
of
the
game
with
a
squad
of
up
to
00
AI
controlled
members
,
either
as
a
member
of
the
squad
or
as
its
leader
.

On-foot
gameplay
and
the
vehicle
elements
are
blended
seamlessly
and
the
player
can
get
into
any
available
vehicle
at
any
time
,
orders
and
mission
conditions
permitting
.

Whether
on
foot
or
in
a
vehicle
the
player
can
view
the
action
from
both
first
and
third-person
views
,
as
well
as
an
additional
'
command
view
'
available
to
squad
leaders
which
gives
the
player
a
limited
birds-eye
view
of
the
surrounding
area
.

At
the
start
of
each
mission
the
player
is
presented
with
a
briefing
explaining
the
situation
,
describing
the
player
's
goals
in
the
mission
and
,
often
,
providing
further
information
in
the
form
of
notes
.

Once
in-game
the
player
is
provided
with
a
map
,
compass
,
watch
,
and
a
notebook
.

Depending
on
the
mission
the
player
may
be
required
to
participate
in
and
complete
a
variety
of
tasks
,
from
simply
driving
a
truck
or
guarding
bases
to
attacking
or
defending
various
objectives
,
patrols
,
reconnaissance
and
sabotage
behind
enemy
lines
,
air
support
,
or
any
combination
of
these
and
more
.

When
the
player
is
given
command
of
a
squad
of
NPC
s
,
the
game
becomes
more
strategy
oriented
.

As
a
leader
the
player
is
responsible
for
guiding
the
squad
to
its
objectives
and
is
able
to
issue
a
wide
variety
of
orders
to
men
under
their
command
,
such
as
movement
orders
,
designation
of
priority
targets
,
formation
orders
and
various
other
tactical
instructions
governing
how
they
should
behave
such
as
holding
fire
or
attacking
only
select
targets
.

Equipment
Operation
Flashpoint
features
a
wide
variety
of
Cold
War-era
equipment
,
all
of
which
can
be
used
by
the
player
,
depending
on
availability
in
any
given
mission
.

Available
firearms
range
from
standard-issue
military
assault
rifles
such
as
the
M00A0
and
the
AK-00
,
machine
guns
,
and
more
specialized
weaponry
such
as
sniper
rifles
and
suppressed
submachine
guns
,
all
of
which
have
iron
sights
or
telescopic
sights
that
the
player
can
use
to
aim
.

Available
vehicles
include
wheeled
vehicles
(
such
as
jeeps
and
trucks
)
,
patrol
boats
,
tanks
and
APC
s
,
helicopters
and
even
fixed-wing
aircraft
such
as
the
A-00
Thunderbolt
II
.

If
a
vehicle
is
accessible
to
the
player
,
they
can
take
the
position
of
driver
or
simply
ride
in
the
vehicle
as
a
passenger
.

Many
vehicles
,
such
as
tanks
,
require
a
crew
of
at
least
a
driver
and
a
gunner
to
be
used
effectively
.

All
vehicles
have
accurately
modeled
0D
interiors
.

Operation
Flashpoint
pioneered
the
use
of
realistic
vehicle
and
aircraft
combat
in
FPS
games
.

While
Operation
Flashpoint
does
not
provide
the
same
level
of
vehicle
realism
as
a
dedicated
simulator
like
Steel
Beasts
,
or
Falcon
0.0
,
it
is
nevertheless
notable
because
it
does
not
only
simulate
aircraft
,
tank
and
infantry
combat
with
consistently
high
levels
of
realism
,
but
also
accurately
simulates
the
complex
relationships
between
these
elements
in
warfare
.

Multiplayer
With
its
vast
built
in
mission
editing
features
,
the
game
engine
does
not
limit
the
gameplay
to
any
specific
mode
.

Instead
,
the
choice
of
mission
type
is
left
to
the
mission
author
.

Most
commonly
implemented
game
modes
include
:
Operation
Flashpoint
also
includes
an
in-game
mission
editor
which
can
be
used
to
create
anything
from
single
missions
to
entire
campaigns
.

Synopsis
Setting
Unlike
most
first-person
shooters
,
in
which
a
dozen
or
more
separate
,
self-contained
'
maps
'
typically
make
up
the
game
world
,
the
game
world
in
Operation
Flashpoint
consists
of
large
fictitious
islands
.

Each
island
is
at
least
a
dozen
square
kilometers
in
size
,
and
is
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
ocean
.

This
is
essentially
the
same
concept
,
but
on
a
much
larger
scale
and
using
oceans
,
rather
than
what
should
be
surmountable
barriers
(
such
as
walls
or
cliffs
)
,
to
stop
the
player
from
leaving
the
area
.

The
game
takes
place
on
three
different
islands
:
The
island-states
of
Everon
and
Malden
(
the
latter
is
a
home
of
American
military
forces
)
,
and
later
in
the
game
,
on
the
barren
Russian
island
of
Kolgujev
which
is
the
staging
point
for
the
renegade
Russian
forces
invading
Everon
and
Malden
.

Plot
The
year
is
0000
,
and
Mikhail
Gorbachev
has
come
to
power
in
the
Soviet
Union
.

While
his
Glasnost
and
Perestroika
reforms
are
welcomed
by
western
governments
,
there
are
communist
hardliners
in
his
own
government
that
are
unsympathetic
to
his
cause
and
are
ready
to
do
anything
to
stop
these
reforms
.

Aleksei
Guba
,
a
renegade
general
,
is
determined
to
bring
down
Gorbachev
and
make
himself
the
next
leader
of
the
Soviet
Union
.

Guba
commands
an
army
on
the
island
base
of
Kolgujev
.

Guba
invades
nearby
Everon
,
crushing
the
militia
force
there
,
and
secretly
plans
to
take
the
war
to
the
Americans
.

The
NATO
presence
on
Malden
,
under
the
command
of
the
American
Colonel
Blake
,
moves
in
to
investigate
the
loss
of
contact
with
Everon
,
and
reports
an
invasion
by
an
'
unknown
hostile
force
'
.

When
a
helicopter
of
troops
sent
to
investigate
does
n't
return
,
Blake
orders
a
full
scale
invasion
of
Everon
,
not
knowing
about
the
Soviets
.

Most
of
the
soldiers
sent
to
Everon
are
the
recruits
who
are
about
to
be
sent
home
after
the
finish
of
their
duty
.

Though
the
NATO
forces
manage
to
take
control
a
portion
of
the
island
,
the
Soviets
eventually
counterattack
,
causing
heavy
losses
to
the
American
forces
and
forcing
their
hasty
retreat
back
to
U.S.-controlled
Malden
.

The
Soviets
do
n't
only
reclaim
Everon
but
push
onto
Malden
as
well
which
brings
the
Americans
on
the
edge
of
defeat
.

Blake
receives
an
ultimatum
from
Guba
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
informed
by
Washington
that
a
full
carrier
group
is
on
route
at
flank
speed
to
lend
assistance
.

Time
is
of
the
essence
as
both
the
U.S.
and
Moscow
denied
that
hostilities
broke
out
on
the
islands
to
prevent
panic
but
at
the
same
time
the
USSR
began
a
full-scale
mobilization
,
allegedly
as
a
military
exercise
.

General
Guba
is
in
possession
of
a
nuclear-tipped
SCUD
aimed
at
Malden
and
the
American
forces
must
prevent
the
missile
launch
from
happening
to
avoid
the
beginning
of
World
War
III
.

During
the
campaign
players
take
the
roles
of
one
of
four
characters
:
The
Islands
Operation
Flashpoint
's
three
main
islands
,
Everon
,
Malden
,
and
Kolgujev
,
are
based
on
actual
existing
islands
.

Everon
is
the
Croatia
n
island
of
Krk
.

Malden
is
the
Greek
Ionian
island
Levkas
.

Kolgujev
is
based
on
Tenerife
Island
,
one
of
the
Canary
Islands
.

Another
island
in
the
game
,
Meganissi
,
the
largest
island
just
to
the
east
of
Levkas
.

Nogova
is
an
island
introduced
in
the
Resistance
expansion
pack
.

While
it
has
no
real
world
analogue
,
it
shares
landmark
names
with
Bohemia
Interactive
's
native
Czech
Republic
and
several
areas
appear
to
be
very
similar
to
areas
in
the
game
.

Development
Reception
Operation
Flashpoint
has
won
critical
acclaim
for
its
realism
of
simulating
military
conflict
situations
on
PC
,
even
to
the
extent
where
the
game
's
technology
has
been
adapted
for
real
soldiers
to
use
as
the
special
combat
training
application
VBS0
.

Partial
listing
:
Expansions
and
sequels
Expansions
An
expansion
Red
Hammer
,
which
was
developed
by
Codemasters
,
depicts
the
same
conflict
as
the
OFP
:
Cold
War
Crisis
,
but
places
the
player
in
the
role
of
a
Russian
soldier
,
Dmitri
Lukin
,
rather
than
an
American
soldier
.

During
the
course
of
the
campaign
,
Lukin
,
who
is
one
of
the
few
soldiers
stationed
on
Kolgujev
with
previous
combat
experience
,
switches
from
his
steadfast
fight
against
American
forces
on
Everon
and
Malden
to
joining
the
resistance
fighters
on
Everon
battling
his
own
countrymen
in
order
to
pave
the
way
for
an
American
take-over
of
the
island
.

He
is
also
tasked
to
kill
or
capture
the
last
officers
still
loyal
to
general
Guba
.

There
are
a
few
new
vehicles
added
,
including
the
AH-00
Apache
,
Bell
OH-00
Kiowa
,
BMP-0
,
BRDM
and
M0A0
Bradley
.

The
save
game
system
was
altered
significantly
,
making
reverting
to
a
previous
level
impossible
.

Lukin
had
been
a
Spetsnaz
in
Afghanistan
but
was
demoted
to
Private
for
not
obeying
the
orders
and
shipped
to
the
regular
army
for
insubordination
.

During
the
course
of
the
Red
Hammer
campaign
he
is
put
in
command
of
a
squad
,
promoted
to
Sergeant
,
drives
tanks
,
flies
helicopters
and
eventually
gets
promoted
to
Lieutenant
and
assigned
back
to
Spetsnaz
.

Resistance

,
sounds
,
and
multiplayer
mechanics
.

The
storyline
takes
place
three
years
before
the
events
of
the
main
storyline
.

The
player
takes
on
the
role
of
an
ex
-
Special
Operations
soldier
,
Victor
Troska
,
who
has
returned
to
his
homeland
of
Nogova
after
years
in
exile
serving
with
British
Special
Forces
.

During
the
first
introductory
mission
to
the
campaign
,
the
island
is
invaded
by
the
Soviet
Union
after
some
members
of
the
socialist
party
betray
the
country
and
invite
Soviet
forces
to
overthrow
the
government
.

Troska
is
approached
by
Nogovans
who
are
resisting
the
Soviet
occupation
and
asked
to
join
them
.

Initially
,
Troska
refuses
to
have
any
part
in
the
fighting
and
rebukes
them
because
he
wants
to
put
the
combat
behind
and
also
believes
that
any
resistance
will
take
many
of
the
inexperienced
soldiers
'
lives
.

Later
,
a
wounded
guerrilla
-
fighter
being
pursued
by
Russian
soldiers
takes
refuge
in
Troska
's
shed
.

When
Soviet
soldiers
,
led
by
Colonel
Guba
,
arrive
,
Troska
is
forced
to
make
a
decision
:
betraying
the
partisan
,
trying
to
negotiate
with
the
Soviets
or
fighting
off
the
Soviet
soldiers
and
joining
the
resistance
.

When
Victor
joins
the
resistance
he
is
immediately
forced
to
take
command
and
fight
the
Soviets
who
attack
their
base
and
kill
the
resistance
commander
.

Then
he
leads
his
units
to
assault
some
Soviet
bases
to
collect
some
weapons
,
ammunition
and
tanks
as
the
resistance
forces
have
only
a
limited
supply
of
weapons
.

Besides
the
fighting
this
becomes
a
very
important
objective
through
all
campaign
.

After
some
initial
successful
actions
more
people
begin
to
join
the
resistance
,
making
it
stronger
.

Later
the
resistance
receives
some
weapon
supplies
from
the
Americans
who
also
send
James
Gastovski
and
his
team
in
to
assist
the
resistance
.

Victor
is
also
helped
by
Tasmanian
Devil
,
an
informant
of
unknown
identity
who
passes
critical
information
to

The
successful
actions
drive
the

back
until
they
are
pushed
to
the
airfield
where
Guba
holds
his
tactical
bombers
to
be
used
to
obliterate
Nogova
after
the
Soviet
retreat
.

Victor
manages
to
destroy
the
bombers
but
the
Soviets
encircle
him
and
is
MIA
after
that
,
presumably
dead
.

The
American
forces
sent
by
Colonel
Blake
wipe
out
the
remaining
Soviet
forces
but
Guba
escapes
before
the
final
defeat

Basic
