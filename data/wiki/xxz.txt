In

Lake
Preston
is

novel
The
Long
Winter
by
American
novelist
Laura
Ingalls
Wilder
.

In

very
severe
winter
of
0000-0000
,
a
neighbor
of
Ingalls
,
David
Gilbert
,
volunteered
to
make
the
very
risky
run
from
De
Smet
,
South
Dakota
to
Lake
Preston
(
called
,
at
that
time
,
simply
"
Preston
,
Dakota
Territory
"
)
to
take
outgoing
mail
and
bring
back
the
incoming
mail
.

Though
the
distance
was
only
about
00
miles
,
the
trip
was
dangerous
because
of
blizzards
coming
up
very
quickly
throughout
that
winter
,
and
a
person
caught
on
the
prairie
during
a
blizzard
had
almost
no
chance
of
survival

Lakota
people
,
and
disputes
over
the
Hills
are
ongoing
,
having
reached
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
on
several
occasions
.

However
,
in
0000
,
Colonel
George
Armstrong
Custer
led
an
expedition
into
the
Hills
and
announced
the
discovery
of
gold
on
French
Creek
near
present-day
Custer
,
South
Dakota
.

Custer
's
announcement
triggered
the
Black
Hills
Gold
Rush
and
gave
rise
to
the
lawless
town
of
Deadwood
,
which
quickly
reached
a
population
of
around
0,000
.

In
early
0000
,
frontiersman
Charlie
Utter
and
his
brother
Steve
led
a
wagon
train
to
Deadwood
containing
what
were
deemed
to
be
needed
commodities
to
bolster
business
.

The
wagon
train
brought
gamblers
and
prostitutes
,
resulting
in
the
establishment
of
profitable
ventures
.

Demand
for
women
was
high
,
and
the
business
of
prostitution
proved
to
have
a
good
market
.

Madam
Dora
DuFran
would
eventually
become
the
most
profitable
brothel
owner
in
Deadwood
,
closely
followed
by
Madam
Mollie
Johnson
.

Businessman
Tom
Miller
opened
the
Bella
Union
Saloon
in
September
of
that
year
.

Another
saloon
was
the
Gem
Variety
Theater
,
opened
April
0
,
0000
by
Al
Swearengen
who
also
controlled
the
opium
trade
in
the
town
.

The
saloon
was
destroyed
by
a
fire
and
rebuilt
in
0000
.

It
burned
down
again
in
0000
,
causing
Swearengen
to
leave
the
town
.

The
town
attained
notoriety
for
the
murder
of
Wild
Bill
Hickok
,
and
Mount
Moriah
Cemetery
remains
the
final
resting
place
of
Hickok
and
Calamity
Jane
,
as
well
as
slightly
less
notable
figures
such
as
Seth
Bullock
.

Deadwood
became
known
for
its
wild
and
almost
lawless
reputation
,
during
which
time
murder
was
common
,
and
punishment
for
murders
not
always
fair
and
impartial
.

Hickok
's
murderer
,
Jack
McCall
,
was
prosecuted
twice
,
despite
the
U.S.
Constitution
's
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
,
because
of
a
ruling
that
Deadwood
was
an
illegal
town
in
Indian
Territory
and
thus
lacked
the
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
or
acquit
McCall
.

This
decision
moved
McCall
's
trial
to
a
Dakota
Territory
court
(
"
Indian
Court
"
)
,
where
he
was
found
guilty
of
murder
and
hanged
.

As
the
economy
changed
from
gold
rush
to
steady
mining
,
Deadwood
lost
its
rough
and
rowdy
character
and
settled
down
into
a
prosperous
town
.

In
0000
,
a
smallpox
epidemic
swept
through
the
camp
with
so
many
falling
ill
that
tents
were
erected
to
quarantine
the
stricken
.

On
December
00
,
0000
,
the
ABC
/
Warner
Brothers
western
television
series
Colt
.00
aired
the
episode
"
Calamity
"
,
a
dramatization
of
the
event
.

Dody
Heath
was
cast
as
Calamity
Jane
and
Joan
Taylor
as
a
woman
doctor
,
Ellen
McGraw
.

In
the
story
line
,
series
character
Christopher
Colt
,
played
by
Wayde
Preston
,
hires
Calamity
Jane
to
drive
the
stagecoach
containing
Dr.
McGraw
and
the
vaccine
needed
to
fight
the
epidemic
.

Colt
is
at
first
unsure
if
Calamity
can
handle
the
job
because
miners
and
Indians
seek
to
steal
the
valuable
medication
.

In
0000
,
General
George
Crook
pursued
the
Sioux
Indians
from
the
Battle
of
Little
Big
Horn
on
an
expedition
that
ended
in
Deadwood
and
is
known
as
the
Horsemeat
March
.

The
Homestake
Mine
in
nearby
Lead
was
established
in
0000
.

For
years
,
it
was
the
longest
continuously
operating
gold
mine
in
the
United
States
.

It
is
now
open
to
tourists
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
a
fire
devastated
Deadwood
,
destroyed
more
than
three
hundred
buildings
,
and
consumed
the
belongings
of
many
inhabitants
.

Many
of
the
newly
impoverished
left
town
to
start
again
elsewhere
without
the
opportunities
of
rich
untapped
veins
of
ore
that
characterized
the
early
days
of
Deadwood
.

A
narrow-gauge
railroad
,
the
Deadwood
Central
Railroad
,
was
founded
by
Deadwood
resident
J.K.P.
Miller
and
his
associates
in
0000
,
in
order
to
serve
their
mining
interests
in
the
Black
Hills
.

The
railroad
was
purchased
by
the
Chicago
,
Burlington
and
Quincy
Railroad
in
0000
.

A
portion
of
the
railroad
between
Deadwood
and
Lead
was
electrified
in
0000
for
operation
as
an
interurban
passenger
system
,
which
operated
until
0000
.

The
railroad
was
abandoned
in
0000
,
apart
from
a
portion
from
Kirk
to
Fantail
Junction
,
which
was
converted
to
standard
gauge
.

The
remaining
section
was
abandoned
by
the
successor
Burlington
Northern
Railroad
in
0000
.

Some
of
the
other
early
town
residents
and
frequent
visitors
included
Al
Swearengen
,
E.
B.
Farnum
,
Charlie
Utter
,
Sol
Star
,
Martha
Bullock
,
A.
W.
Merrick
,
Samuel
Fields
,
Calamity
Jane
,
Dr.
Valentine
McGillycuddy
,
the
Reverend
Henry
Weston
Smith
,
and
Wild
Bill
Hickok
.

00th
and
00st
centuries
Another
major
fire
in
September
0000
came
close
to
destroying
the
town
.

About
were
burned
and
an
evacuation
order
was
issued
.

Nearly
0,000
volunteer
and
professional
firefighter
s
,
including
personnel
from
the
Homestake
Mine
and
Ellsworth
Air
Force
Base
,
worked
to
contain
the
fire
,
which
resulted
in
a
major
regional
economic
downturn
.

The
entire
town
was
designated
a
National
Historic
Landmark
in
0000
.

However
,
the
town
underwent
additional
decline
and
financial
stresses
during
the
next
two
decades
.

Interstate
00
bypassed
it
in
0000
and
its
brothels
were
shut
down
after
a
0000
raid
.

A
fire
in
December
0000
destroyed
the
historic
Syndicate
Building
and
a
neighboring
structure
.

The
fire
spurred
the
"
Deadwood
Experiment
"
,
in
which
gambling
was
tested
as
a
means
of
revitalizing
a
city
center
.

At
the
time
,
gambling
was
legal
only
in
the
state
of
Nevada
and
in
Atlantic
City
.

Deadwood
was
the
first
small
community
in
the
U.S.
to
seek
legal
gambling
revenues
as
a
way
of
maintaining
local
historic
qualities
.

Gambling
was
legalized
in
Deadwood
in
0000
and
immediately
brought
significant
new
revenues
and
development
.

The
pressure
of
development
may
have
an
effect
on
the
historical
integrity
of
the
landmark
district
.

Chinatown
The
gold
rush
attracted
Chinese
immigrants
to
the
area
.

Their
population
peaked
at
000
.

A
few
engaged
in
mining
;
most
worked
in
service
enterprises
.

A
quarter
arose
on
Main
Street
,
encouraged
by
the
lack
of
restrictions
on
foreign
property
ownership
in
Dakota
Territory
and
a
relatively
high
level
of
tolerance
.

Wong
Fee
Lee
arrived
in
Deadwood
in
0000
and
became
a
leading
merchant
.

He
was
a
community
leader
among
the
Chinese
Americans
until
his
death
in
0000
.

The
quarter
's
residents
also
included
African-Americans
and
Americans
of
European
extraction
.

The
state
sponsored
an
archeological
dig
in
the
area
during
the
0000s
.

starts
in
Deadwood
and
runs
south
through
the
Black
Hills
to
Edgemont

June
the
Mickelson
Trail
Marathon
and
0K
,
as
well
as
accompanying
races

Climate
Deadwood
's
climate
varies
considerably
from
the
rest

surrounding
areas
.

While
most
of
the

annual
precipitation
amounts
in

reach
nearly
00
inches
.

Most
of
these
00
inches
fall
in
the
winter
as
snow
,
although
snow
can
occur
as
early
as

Lead
(
pronounced
"
leed
"
)
is
a
city
in
Lawrence
County
,
South
Dakota
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Lead
is
located
in
western
South
Dakota
,
in
the
Black
Hills
near
the
Wyoming
state
line
.

History
The
city
was
officially
founded
on
July
00
,
0000
,
after
the
discovery
of
gold
.

It
is
the
site
of
the
Homestake
Mine
,
the
largest
,
deepest
(
)
and
most
productive
gold
mine
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
before
closing
in
January
0000
.

By
0000
,
Lead
had
a
population
of
0,000
,
making
it
the
second
largest
town
in
South
Dakota
.

Lead
was
originally
founded
as
a
company
town
by
the
Homestake
Mining
Company
,
which
ran
the
nearby
Homestake
Mine
.

Phoebe
Hearst
,
wife
of
one
of
the
principals
,
was
instrumental
in
making
Lead
more
livable
.

She
established
the
Hearst
Free
Public
Library
in
town
,
and
in
0000
the
Hearst
Free
Kindergarten
.

Phoebe
Hearst
and
Thomas
Grier
,
the
Homestake
Mine
superintendent
worked
together
to
create
the
Homestake
Opera
House
and
Recreation
Center
for
the
benefit
of
miner
workers
and
their
families
.

Phoebe
Hearst
donated
regularly
to
Lead
's
churches
,
and
provided
college
scholarships
to
the
children
of
mine
and
mill
workers
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
due
to
fear
of
cave
ins
of
the
miles
of
tunnels
under
Lead
's
Homestake
Mine
,
many
of
the
towns
buildings
located
in
the
bottom
of
a
canyon
were
moved
further
uphill
to
safer
locations
.

Lead
and
the
Homestake
Mine
have
been
selected
as
the
site
of
the
Deep
Underground
Science

a
proposed
NSF
facility
for
low-background
experiments
on
neutrinos
,
dark
matter
,
and
other
nuclear
physics
topics
,
as
well
as
biology
and
mine
engineering
studies
.

In

most
of
Lead
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of

Spearfish
is
a
city
in
Lawrence
County
,
South
Dakota
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Prior
to
the
Black
Hills
Gold
Rush
of
0000
,
the
area
was
used
by
Native
American
s
(
primarily
bands
of
Sioux
but
others
also
ranged
through
the
area
)
who
would
spear
fish
in
the
creek
(
hence
the
name
of
the
creek
and
subsequently
the
town
)
.

Once
the
gold
rush
started
,
the
city
was
founded
(
0000
)
at
the
mouth
of
Spearfish
Canyon
,
and
Spearfish
grew
as
a
supplier
of
foodstuffs
to
the
mining
camps
in
the
hills
.

Even
today
,
a
significant
amount
of
truck
farming
or
market
gardening
still
occurs
in
the
vicinity
.

In
0000
,
the
accepted
history
of
gold
mining
in
the
Black
Hills
was
thrown
into
question
by
the
discovery
of
what
has
become
known
as
the
Thoen
Stone
.

Discovered
by
Louis
Thoen
on
the
slopes
of
Lookout
Mountain
,
the
stone
purports
to
be
the
last
testament
of
Ezra
Kind
who
,
along
with
six
others
,
entered
the
Black
Hills
in
0000
(
at
a
time
when
whites
were
forbidden
by
law
and
treaty
from
entering
the
area
)
,
"
got
all
the
gold
we
could
carry
"
in
June
0000
,
and
were
subsequently
"
killed
by
Indians
beyond
the
high
hill
.
"

While
it
may
seem
unlikely
that
someone
who
has
"
lost
my
gun
and
nothing
to
eat
and
Indians
hunting
me
"
would
take
the
time
to
carve
his
story
in
sandstone
,
there
is
corroborating
historical
evidence
for
the
Ezra
Kind
party
.

In
the
00th
Century
,
the
history
of
Spearfish
was
tied
very
closely
to
mining
and
tourism
.

Architect
Frank
Lloyd
Wright
,
who
visited
Spearfish
Canyon
(
located
between
Spearfish
and
Deadwood
)
in
0000
,
later
called
the
area
"
unique
and
unparalleled
elsewhere
in
our
country
,
"
and
wondered
"
how
is
it
that
I
've
heard
so
little
of
this
miracle
and
we
,
toward
the
Atlantic
,
have
heard
so
much
of
the
Grand
Canyon
when
this
is
even
more
miraculous
"
.

The
Homestake
Sawmill
(
previously
part
of
Pope
and
Talbot
,
now
owned
by
Neimen
Forest
Products
)
was
built
to
supply
timbers
for
the
Homestake
Mine
in
Lead
(
closed
January
0000
)
.

In
0000
Joseph
Meier
brought
the
Luenen
Passion
Play
to
settle
permanently
in
Spearfish
and
become
the
Black
Hills
Passion
Play
,
drawing
thousands
of
visitors
every
year
during
the
summer
months
.

In
0000
after
the
death
of
Joseph
Meier
,
the
amphitheater
and
surrounding
it
were
put
on
up
for
sale
.

Geography
Spearfish
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-000.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
,
is
land
and
is
water
.

Spearfish
Creek
is
a
fast
moving
creek
that
emerges
from
Spearfish
Canyon
at
Spearfish
.

It
runs
roughly
south
to
north
through
the
center
of
town
(
parallel
to
Canyon
Street
)
,
year
round
.

The
creek
is
unusual
in
that
it
freezes
from
the
bottom
up
,
instead
of
icing
over
.

This
unusual
phenomenon
occurs
due
to
the
very
fast
rate
at
which
the
creek
flows
.

This
speed
prevents
ice
from
forming
except
along
the
bottom
of
the
creek
bed
where
friction
and
turbulence
allow
the
water
to
slow
down
long
enough
to
freeze
.

Since
the
creek
continues
to
flow
atop
this
ice
,
the
water
level
of
the
creek
gradually
rises
as
more
ice
accumulates
on
the
bottom
,
in
some
cases
causing
flooding
on
the
north
side
of
town
where
the
channel
is
not
as
deep
.

Spearfish
has
been
assigned
the
ZIP
code
00000
and
the
FIPS
place
code
00000
.

Black
Hills
State
University
has
its
own
ZIP
code
,

.

Climate
Given
its
location
at
the
base
of
the
Black
Hills
and
its
proximity
to
the
High
Plains
,
the
climate
in
Spearfish
is
highly
variable
at
any
time
of
the
year
.

This
is
especially
true
in
the
winter
months
.

World
record
temperature
change
Spearfish
holds
the
world
record
for
the
fastest
temperature
change
.

On
January

,
0000
at

0:00
a.m.
MST
,
the
temperature
in
Spearfish
was

The
Chinook
wind
picked
up

rapidly
,
and
two

(
0:00
a.m.
)
the
temperature
was
+00
°
F
(

)
above
zero
.

The
00

F
(

rise
in
two

set
a
world
record
that
still
holds
.

By

,
the
temperature
had
risen
to

,
the
chinook
died
down
and
the

tumbled
back
to

.

The

Augustana
College
In
0000
,
Augustana
College
moved
from
Beloit
,
IA
to
Canton
.

An
elementary
through
high
school
was
also
built
as
part
of
Augustana
's
relocation
,
and
educated
the
internationally
known
physicist
Merle
Tuve
,
and
brothers
John
Lawrence
and
Ernest
Lawrence
.

Augustana
struggled
in
Canton
until
Anthony
G.
Tuve
became
president
in
0000
.

Attendance
doubled
,
but
a
series
of
crop
failures
soon
followed
.

As
a
result
,
in
0000
,
the
Church
Synod
withheld
appropriations
.

President
Tuve
assumed
all
financial
obligations
in
order
to
keep
the
school
open
.

After
the
crisis
,
Augustana
prospered
and
soon
outgrew
its
building
.

The
building
was
moved
in
0000
.

Then
,
in
0000
,
the
college
added
to
the
campus
on
the
east
side
of
town
.

A
four
and
½
story
brick
building
was
erected
to
house
classrooms
,
a
gymnasium
,
and
chapel
.

The
new
structure
was
dedicated
in
0000
.

The
college
continued
to
grow
.

Enrollment
increased
to
000
by
0000
.

The
school
became
widely
known
for
its
excellence
in
academics
and
for
the
many
scholars
came
for
speaking
engagements
.

The
United
Norwegian
Lutheran
Synod
had
its
headquarters
on
campus
.

An
event
in
0000
took
place
that
changed
the
college
and
community
.

That
year
,
the
Norwegian
Lutheran
Synods
merged
to
become
the
Norwegian
Lutheran
Church
of
America
.

The
new
synod
considered
it
inadvisable
to
maintain
Augustana
College
and
Lutheran
Normal
School
in
Sioux
Falls
,
barely
00
miles
apart
.

A
vigorous
campaign
to
keep
the
college
in
Canton
began
.

But
,
the
advantages
of
locating
the
school
in
a
larger
community
prevailed
,
and
Canton
lost
their
college
.

The
bitterness
was
great
,
and
was
intensified
when
President
Tuve
died
suddenly
.

The
area
pastors
in
the
South
Dakota
district
realized
something
needed
to
be
done
.

An
agreement
was
proposed
and
accepted
that
Canton
would
put
up
an
endowment
of
$
000,000
and
turn
it
over
to
Augustana
College
.

Then
,
the
Normal
School
division
would
move
to
Canton
.

A
fund
drive
was
successful
and
the
Canton
Lutheran
Normal
School
opened
in
the
fall
of
0000
.

The
gradual
transfer
of
the
Academy
division
to
the
Canton
campus
was
made
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
school
was
known
as
Augustana
Academy
in
0000
and
was
no
longer
a
division
of
the
college
.

Capital
improvements
were
made
to
the
campus
through
the
next
several
years
including
a
new
gymnasium
and
dormitory
.

The
history
of
Augustana
Academy
came
to
an
end
in
0000
.

The
campus
was
closed
and
was
sold
to
Keystone
Treatment
Center
.

The
“
Old
Main
”
building
has
been
converted
into
apartments
.

National
Ski
Tournament
Site
&
Sioux
Valley
Ski
Club
A
young
man
by
the
named
Ludwig
Holter
from
Norway
,
gave
a
skiing
exhibition
to
a
group
of
Canton
Students
in
0000
.

This
exhibition
began
the
quest
to
clear
the
hill
and
build
a
scaffold
and
jump
in
0000
.

From
that
platform
at
the
peak
of
the
hill
to
a
landing
place
was
drop
of
000
feet
.

Skiers
could
cover
a
distance
of
one
eighth
of
a
mile
at
up
to
000
miles
per
hour
.

Soon
tournaments
were
held
at
about
two-year
intervals
.

On
February
00
and
00
,
0000
,
a
National
Tournament
was
held
and
Canton
hosted
over
0,000
fans
.

The
Sioux
Valley
Ski
Club
was
organized
that
year
.

World
renowned
singer
,
Eric
Bye
,
gave
the
trophy
to
the
Sioux
Valley
Club
.

Many
notables
were
present
that
day
including
a
member
of
the
Olympic
team
,
national
champions
,
and
the
international
winner
and
the
winner
of
the
world
distance
title
.

Many
tournaments
were
held
at
the
site
.

The
largest
on
record
was
the0000
National
tournament
when
00,000-00
,000
people
attended
.

Tournaments
declined
in
the
0000s
.

Cost
increases
and
slowing
attendance
prompted
the
last
Central
U.S.
tournament
in
0000
.

The
last
national
event
was
in
0000
.

Snow
was
scarce
so
it
was
truck
in
from
Spirit
Lake
and
Lake
Okoboji
,
Iowa
.

By
the
time
the
snow
was
in
place
,
it
had
turned
into
slush
.

Winds
changed
and
brought
bitter
temperatures
causing
the
slush
to
freeze
.

The
tournament
had
to
be
cancelled
.

The
ski
hill
is
all
that
remains
of
the
tournament
site
.

Hiawatha
Insane
Asylum
The
first
and
only
institution
for
insane
Indians
in
the
United
States
was
Hiawatha
Asylum
for
Insane
Indians
.

It
was
placed
in
Canton
because
of
the
central
location
among
the
Western
states
with
a
large
Indian
populations
and
because
of
the
influence
of
South
Dakota
's
Representative
O.S.
Gifford
and
Senator
R.
F.
Pettigrew
.

In
0000
,
Congress
passed
a
bill
creating
the
institution
.

The
bill
establishing
the
Hiawatha
Asylum
for
Insane
Indians
passed
in
0000
,
and
the
Indian
Appropriation
Act
for
0000
set
aside
$
0,000
for
land
purchase
and
$
00,000
for
building
construction
.

One
hundred
acres
were
purchased
a
mile
east
of
Canton
on
the
hills
overlooking
the
Sioux
River
.

The
asylum
was
closed
in
0000
.

The
asylum
grounds
and
buildings
were
used
for
a
short
time
by
South
Dakota
as
a
penitentiary
for
first
time
offenders
.

In
0000
,
in
what
Cantonites
refer
to
as
the
"
second
Manhattan
Purchase
,
"
the
city
purchased
for
$
0.00
the
000
acres
and
buildings
of
the
old
institution
.

The
only
stipulation
of
the
purchases
was
that
it
be
used
for
the
welfare
of
the
community
.

For
a
time
,
the
asylum
hospital
was
used
for
the
Canton-Inwood
Hospital
,
but
today
the
old
asylum
buildings
are
gone
.

The
land
is
now
home
to
Sanford
Hospital
Canton-Inwood
,
Three
Rivers
Gun
Club
,
the
0-H
fairground
and
Hiawatha
County
Club
and
Golf
Course
.

Today
,
a
cemetery
for
000
patients
of
the
asylum
is
located
on
the
original
grounds
of
the
asylum
.

The
National
Park
Service
added
the
cemetery
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Past
and
Future
Founded
as
the
town
at
the
end
of
the
railroad
,
Faith
was
originally
the
hub
of
a
homestead
boom
in
the
period
0000-0000
;
but
the
drought
conditions
of
the
0000s
that
led
to
the
Dust
Bowl
of
the
0000s
quickly
replaced
abnormally
wet
conditions
of
the
early
00th
Century
,
and
the
harsh
winters
of
the
Northern
Plains
quickly
drove
many
sodbusters
to
more
hospitable
regions
.

The
town
's
location
allows
for
ranch
families
in
the
area
to
have
schools
and
stores
closer
than
Sturgis
,
Fort
Pierre
,
or
other
regional
market
towns
,
but
early
expectations
of
steady
growth
were
never
realized
.

Faith
is
still
well
known
for
its
rodeos
and
livestock
sales
.

The
town
's
location
made
it
a
necessary
stop
on
the
Sunset
Trail
also
known
as
the
Yellowstone
Trail
.

Although
like
most
small
rural
cities
of
the
Great
Plains
,
Faith
has
declined
in
population
,
its
distance
from
alternative
locations
for
schools
and
businesses
and
its
geographic
location
near
county
and
reservation
boundaries
mean
that
it
is
unlikely
to
become
a
ghost
town
or
see
its
institutions
consolidated
out
of
existence
.

annual
motorcycle
events
in
the
world
,
which
is
held
annually
on
the
first

Motorcycle

flock

distributed
along
the
partition
separating
fluid
chambers
in
the
coiled
tapered
tube
of
the
cochlea
.

The
name
is
derived
from
the
Latin
for
snail
shell
,
which
in
turn
is
from
the
Greek
κοχλίας
kokhlias
(
"
snail
,
screw
"
)
,
from
κόχλος
kokhlos
(
"
spiral
shell
"
)
in
reference
to
its
coiled
shape
;
the
cochlea
is
coiled
in
mammals
with
the
exception
of
monotreme
s.
Anatomy
Structures
The
cochlea
(
plural
is
cochleae
)
is
a
spiralled
,
hollow
,
conical
chamber
of
bone
,
in
which
waves
propagate
from
the
base
(
near
the
middle
ear
and
the
oval
window
)
to
the
apex
(
the
top
or
center
of
the
spiral
)
.

Its
structures
include
:
The
cochlea
is
a
portion
of
the
inner
ear
that
looks
like
a
snail
shell
(
cochlea
is
Latin
for
snail
.
)

The
cochlea
receives
sound
in
the
form
of
vibrations
,
which
cause
the
stereocilia
to
move
.

The
stereocilia
then
convert
these
vibrations
into
nerve
impulses
which
are
taken
up
to
the
brain
to
be
interpreted
.

Two
of
the
three
fluid
sections
are
canals
and
the
third
is
a
sensitive
'
organ
of
Corti
'
which
detects
pressure
impulses
which
travel
along
the
auditory
nerve
to
the
brain
.

The
two
canals
are
called
the
vestibular
canal
and
the
tympanic
canal
.

Detailed
anatomy
The
walls
of
the
hollow
cochlea
are
made
of
bone
,
with
a
thin
,
delicate
lining
of
epithelial
tissue
.

This
coiled
tube
is
divided
through
most
of
its
length
by
an
inner
membranous
partition
.

Two
fluid-filled
outer
spaces
(
scalae
)
are
formed
by
this
dividing
membrane
.

At
the
top
of
the
snailshell-like
coiling
tubes
,
there
is
a
reversal
of
the
direction
of
the
fluid
,
thus
changing
the
scala
vestibuli
to
the
scala
tympani
.

This
area
is
called
the
helicotrema
.

This
continuation
at
the
helicotrema
allows
fluid
being
pushed
into
the
scala
vestibuli
by
the
oval
window
to
move
back
out
via
movement
in
scala
tympani
and
deflection
of
the
round
window
;
since
the
fluid
is
nearly
incompressible
and
the
bony
walls
are
rigid
,
it
is
essential
for
the
conserved
fluid
volume
to
exit
somewhere
.

The
lengthwise
partition
that
divides
most
of
the
cochlea
is
itself
a
fluid-filled
tube
,
the
third
scala
.

This
central
column
is
called
the
scala
media
,
or
cochlear
duct
.

Its
fluid
,
endolymph
,
also
contains
electrolytes
and
proteins
,
but
is
chemically
quite
different
from
perilymph
.

Whereas
the
perilymph
is
rich
in
sodium
ions
,
the
endolymph
is
rich
in
potassium
ions
,
which
produces
an
ionic
,
electrical
potential
.

The
hair
cells
are
arranged
in
four
rows
in
the
organ
of
Corti
along
the
entire
length
of
the
cochlear
coil
.

Three
rows
consist
of
outer
hair
cells
(
OHCs
)
and
one
row
consists
of
inner
hair
cells
(
IHCs
)
.

The
inner
hair
cells
provide
the
main
neural
output
of
the
cochlea
.

The
outer
hair
cells
,
instead
,
mainly
receive
neural
input
from
the
brain
,
which
influences
their
motility
as
part
of
the
cochlea
's
mechanical
pre-amplifier
.

The
input
to
the
OHC
is
from
the
olivary
body
via
the
medial
olivocochlear
bundle
.

The
cochlear
duct
is
almost
as
complex
on
its
own
as
the
ear
itself
.

The
cochlear
duct
is
bounded
on
three
sides
by
the
basilar
membrane
,
the
stria
vascularis
,
and
Reissner
's
membrane
.

Stria
vascularis
is
a
rich
bed
of
capillaries
and
secretory
cells
;
Reissner
's
membrane
is
a
thin
membrane
that
separates
endolymph
from
perilymph
;
and
the
basilar
membrane
is
a
mechanically
somewhat
stiff
membrane
,
supporting
the
receptor
organ
for
hearing
,
the
organ
of
Corti
,
and
determines
the
mechanical
wave
propagration
properties
of
the
cochlear
system
.

Physiological
functioning
Summary
The
cochlea
is
filled
with
a
watery
liquid
,
the
perilymph
,
which
moves
in
response
to
the
vibrations
coming
from
the
middle
ear
via
the
oval
window
.

As
the
fluid
moves
,
the
cochlear
partition
(
basilar
membrane
and
organ
of
Corti
)
moves
;
thousands
of
hair
cell
s
sense
the
motion
via
their
stereocilia
,
and
convert
that
motion
to
electrical
signals
that
are
communicated
via
neurotransmitters
to
many
thousands
of
nerve
cells
.

These
primary
auditory
neurons
transform
the
signals
into
electrochemical
impulses
known
as
action
potential
s
,
which
travel
along
the
auditory
nerve
to
structures
in
the
brainstem
for
further
processing
.

Detailed
events
The
stapes
(
stirrup
)
ossicle
bone
of
the
middle
ear
transmits
vibrations
to
the
fenestra
ovalis
(
oval
window
)
on
the
outside
of
the
cochlea
,
which
vibrates
the
perilymph
in
the
scala
vestibuli
(
upper
chamber
of
the
cochlea
)
.

The
ossicles
are
essential
for
efficient
coupling
of
sound
waves
into
the
cochlea
,
since
the
cochlea
environment
is
a
fluid
–
membrane
system
,
and
it
takes
more
pressure
to
move
sound
through
fluid
–
membrane
waves
than
it
does
through
air
;
a
pressure
increase
is
achieved
by
the
area
ratio
of
the
tympanic
membrane
to
the
oval
window
,
resulting
in
a
pressure
gain
of
about
00
×
from
the
original
sound
wave
pressure
in
air
.

This
gain
is
a
form
of
impedance
matching
–
to
match
the
soundwave
travelling
through
air
to
that
travelling
in
the
fluid
–
membrane
system
.

At
the
base
of
the
cochlea
,
each
scala
ends
in
a
membranous
portal
that
faces
the
middle
ear
cavity
:
The
scala
vestibuli
ends
at
the
oval
window
,
where
the
footplate
of
the
stapes
sits
.

The
footplate
vibrates
when
the
pressure
is
transmitted
via
the
ossicular
chain
.

The
wave
in
the
perilymph
moves
away
from
the
footplate
and
towards
the
helicotrema
.

Since
those
fluid
waves
move
the
cochlear
partition
that
separates
the
scalae
up
and
down
,
the
waves
have
a
corresponding
symmetric
part
in
perilymph
of
the
scala
tympani
,
which
ends
at
the
round
window
,
bulging
out
when
the
oval
window
bulges
in
.

The
perilymph
in
scala
vestibuli
and
the
endolymph
in
scala
media
act
mechanically
as
a
single
duct
,
being
kept
apart
only
by
the
very
thin
Reissner
's
membrane
.

The
vibrations
of
the
endolymph
in
the
scala
media
displace
the
basilar
membrane
in
a
pattern
that
peaks
a
distance
from
the
oval
window
depending
upon
the
soundwave
frequency
.

The
organ
of
Corti
vibrates
due
to
outer
hair
cell
s
further
amplifying
these
vibrations
.

Inner
hair
cell
s
are
then
displaced
by
the
vibrations
in
the
fluid
,
and
depolarise
by
an
influx
of
K
+
via
their
tip-link-connected
channels
,
and
send
their
signals
via
neurotransmitter
to
the
primary
auditory
neurons
of
the
spiral
ganglion
.

The
hair
cells
in
the
organ
of
Corti
are
tuned
to
certain
sound
frequencies
by
way
of
their
location
in
the
cochlea
,
due
to
the
degree
of
stiffness
in
the
basilar
membrane
.

This
stiffness
is
due
to
,
among
other
things
,
the
thickness
and
width
of
the
basilar
membrane
,
which
along
the
length
of
the
cochlea
is
stiffest
nearest
its
beginning
at
the
oval
window
,
where
the
stapes
introduces
the
vibrations
coming
from
the
eardrum
.

Since
its
stiffness
is
high
there
,
it
allows
only
high-frequency
vibrations
to
move
the
basilar
membrane
,
and
thus
the
hair
cells
.

The
farther
a
wave
travels
towards
the
cochlea
's
apex
(
the
helicotrema
)
,
the
less
stiff
the
basilar
membrane
is
;
thus
lower
frequencies
travel
down
the
tube
,
and
the
less-stiff
membrane
is
moved
most
easily
by
them
where
the
reduced
stiffness
allows
:
that
is
,
as
the
basilar
membrane
gets
less
and
less
stiff
,
waves
slow
down
and
it
responds
better
to
lower
frequencies
.

In
addition
,
in
mammals
,
the
cochlea
is
coiled
,
which
has
been
shown
to
enhance
low-frequency
vibrations
as
they
travel
through
the
fluid-filled
coil
.

This
spatial
arrangement
of
sound
reception
is
referred
to
as
tonotopy
.

For
very
low
frequencies
(
below
00
Hz
)
,
the
waves
propagate
along
the
complete
route
of
the
cochlea
–
differentially
up
scala
vestibuli
and
scala
tympani
all
the
way
to
the
helicotrema
.

Frequencies
this
low
still
activate
the
organ
of
Corti
to
some
extent
,
but
are
too
low
to
elicit
the
perception
of
a
pitch
.

Higher
frequencies
do
not
propagate
to
the
helicotrema
,
due
to
the
stiffness-mediated
tonotopy
.

A
very
strong
movement
of
the
basilar
membrane
due
to
very
loud
noise
may
cause
hair
cells
to
die
.

This
is
a
common
cause
of
partial
hearing
loss
and
is
the
reason
why
users
of
firearms
or
heavy
machinery
often
wear
earmuff
s
or
earplug
s.
Phenomena
Amplification
by
the
hair
cells
Not
only
does
the
cochlea
"
receive
"
sound
,
it
generates
and
amplifies
sound
when
it
is
healthy
.

Where
the
organism
needs
a
mechanism
to
hear
very
faint
sounds
,
the
cochlea
amplifies
by
the
reverse
transduction
of
the
OHCs
,
converting
electrical
signals
back
to
mechanical
in
a
positive-feedback
configuration
.

The
OHCs
have
a
protein
motor
called
prestin
on
their
outer
membranes
;
it
generates
additional
movement
that
couples
back
to
the
fluid
–
membrane
wave
.

This
"
active
amplifier
"
is
essential
in
the
ear
's
ability
to
amplify
weak
sounds
.

The
active
amplifier
also
leads
to
the
phenomenon
of
soundwave
vibrations
being
emitted
from
the
cochlea
back
into
the
ear
canal
through
the
middle
ear
(
otoacoustic
emissions
)
.

Otoacoustic
emissions
Otoacoustic
emission
s
are
due
to
a
wave
exiting
the
cochlea
via
the
oval
window
,
and
propagating
back
through
the
middle
ear
to
the
eardrum
,
and
out
the
ear
canal
,
where
it
can
be
picked
up
by
a
microphone
.

Otoacoustic
emissions
are
important
in
some
types
of
tests
for
hearing
impairment
,
since
they
are
present
when
the
cochlea
is
working
well
,
and
less
so
when
it
is
suffering
from
loss
of
OHC
activity
.

Comparative
physiology
The
coiled
form
of
cochlea
is
unique
to
mammal
s.
In
birds
and
in
other
non-mammalian
vertebrate
s
,
the
compartment
containing
the
sensory
cells
for
hearing
is
occasionally
also
called
"
cochlea
,
"
despite
not
being
coiled
up
.

Instead
,
it
forms
a
blind-ended
tube
,
also
called
the
cochlear
duct
.

This
difference
apparently
evolved
in
parallel
with
the
differences
in
frequency
range
of
hearing
and
in
frequency
resolution
between
mammals
and
non-mammalian
vertebrates
.

Most
bird
species
do
not
hear
above
0
–
0
kHz
,
the
currently
known
maximum
being
~
00
kHz
in
the
barn
owl
.

Some
marine
mammals
hear
up
to
000
kHz
.

The
superior
frequency
resolution
in
mammals
is
due
to
their
unique
mechanism
of
pre-amplification
of
sound
by
active
cell-body
vibrations
of
outer
hair
cells
.

A
long
coiled
compartment
,
rather
than
a
short
and
straight
one
,
provides
more
space
for
mapping
pitches
,
so
is
therefore
better
adapted
to
the
highly
derived
functions
in
mammalian
hearing
.

As
the
study
of
the
cochlea
should
fundamentally
be
focused
at
the
level
of
hair
cells
,
it
is
important
to
note
the
anatomical
and
physiological
differences
between
the
hair
cells
of
various
species
.

In
birds
,
for
instance
,
instead
of
outer
and
inner
hair
cells
,
there
are
tall
and
short
hair
cells
.

There
are
several
similarities
of
note
in
regard
to
this
comparative
data
.

For
one
,
the
tall
hair
cell
is
very
similar
in
function
to
that
of
the
inner
hair
cell
,
and
the
short
hair
cell
is
very
similar
in
function
to
that
of
the
outer
hair
cell
.

One
unavoidable
difference
,
however
,
is
that
while
all
hair
cells
are
attached
to
a
tectorial
membrane
in
birds
,
only
the
outer
hair
cells
are
attached
to
the
tectorial
membrane
in
mammals
.

Bionics
In
0000
,
engineers
at
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
created
an
electronic
chip
that
can
quickly
analyze
a
very
large
range
of
radio
frequencies
while
using
only
a
fraction
of
the
power
needed
for
existing
technologies
;
its
design
specifically
mimics
a
cochlea
.

Role
of
gap-junction
Gap-junction
proteins
,
called
connexin
s
,
expressed
in
the
cochlea
play
an
important
role
in
auditory
functioning
.

Mutations
in
gap-junction
genes
have
been
found
to
cause
syndromic
and
nonsyndromic
deafness
.

Certain
connexins
,
including
connexin
00
and
connexin
00
,
are
prevalent
in
the
two
distinct
gap-junction
systems
found
in
the
cochlea
.

The
epithelial-cell
gap-junction
network
couples
non-sensory
epithelial
cells
,
while
the
connective-tissue
gap-junction
network
couples
connective-tissue
cells
.

Gap-junction
channels
recycle
potassium
ions
back
to
the
endolymph
after
mechanotransduction
in
hair
cells
.

Importantly
,
gap
junction
channels
are
found
between
cochlear
supporting
cells
,
but
not
auditory
hair
cells
.

Hill
City
is
the
oldest
existing
city
in
Pennington
County
,
South
Dakota
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

Hill
City
is
located
southwest
of
Rapid
City
on
State
Highway
00
and
on
U.S.
Route
000
that
connects
Deadwood
to
Hot
Springs
.

Hill
City
is
known
as
the
"
Heart
of
the
Hills
"
which
is
derived
from
its
close
proximity
to
both
the
geographical
center
of
the
Black
Hills
,
and
the
local
tourist
destinations
.

The
city
has
its
roots
in
the
Black
Hills
mining
rush
of
the
late
00th
century
.

Tin
mining
was
dominant
in
the
0000s
and
led
to
an
influx
of
capital
and
people
into
the
area
.

As
the
mining
industry
subsequently
waned
,
tourism
and
timber
became
increasingly
important
to
the
area
.

With
the
establishment
of
Mount
Rushmore
in
the
0000s
,
Custer
State
Park
,
and
the
Sturgis
Motorcycle
Rally
,
the
Black
Hills
became
known
as
a
tourist
destination
which
Hill
City
benefited
from
.

In
recent
years
the
city
has
diversified
to
become
a
center
for
the
arts
in
the
area
featuring
several
art
studios
and
festivals
.

History
Human
history
in
the
area
that
became
Hill
City
,
and
the
greater
Black
Hills
in
particular
,
started
by
at
least
0000
B.C.
.

The
Arikara
arrived
by
0000
A.
D.
,
followed
by
the
Cheyenne
,
Crow
,
Kiowa
and
Pawnee
.

In
the
00th
century
the
Lakota
Sioux
claimed
the
land
calling
it
Paha
Sapa
.

In
0000
Major
General
George
Armstrong
Custer
led
an
expedition
into
the
Black
Hills
during
which
gold
was
discovered
in
French
Creek
,
south
of
Hill
City
.

The
discovery
of
gold
opened
the
Black
Hills
,
and
the
Hill
City
area
,
to
mining
.

Hill
City
was
first
settled
by
miners
in
0000
who
referred
to
the
area
as
Hillyo
.

This
was
the
second
American
settlement
in
the
Black
Hills
.

Hill
City
is
the
oldest
city
still
in
existence
in
Pennington
County
.

A
post
office
was
constructed
and
opened
on
November
00
,
0000
.

The
city
almost
reverted
into
a
ghost
town
when
miners
relocated
to
the
northern
Black
Hills
after
the
discovery
of
gold
there
.

However
,
in
0000
,
tin
was
discovered
near
town
and
the
population
rebounded
.

The
Harney
Peak
Tin
Mining
,
Milling
,
and
Manufacturing
Company
made
its
headquarters
on
Main
Street
along
with
at
one
time
00
saloons
.

The
company
was
backed
by
English
financiers
and
bought
0000
prospecting
sites
around
the
area
.

As
mining
grew
,
the
city
became
known
for
its
wild
living
and
was
once
referred
to
as
,
"
a
town
with
a
church
on
each
end
and
a
mile
of
Hell
in
between
.
"

The
company
built
the
Harney
Peak
Hotel
on
Main
Street
to
entertain
its
management
and
executives
.

Upon
realizing
the
market
in
Tin
was
unsustainable
,
the
company
ceased
operation
in
0000
.

Although
a
small
school
building
was
established
previously
,
a
main
school
building
was
constructed
on
Main
Street
in
0000
.

This
school
building
was
replaced
in
0000
with
the
current
high
school
.

On
July
00
,
0000
a
fire
started
ten
miles
(
00
km
)
outside
of
Hill
City
.

Among
those
who
battled
the
blaze
was
Hill
City
High
School
's
entire
basketball
squad
,
as
well
as
several
teachers
and
administrators
.

US
forest
service
named
the
school
boys
one
of
the
best
crews
who
fought
the
fire
.

The
school
team
name
thus
became
the
Hill
City
Rangers
and
was
privileged
as
the
only
school
district
in
the
United
States
allowed
to
use
Smokey
Bear
as
its
official
mascot
.

Hill
City
was
incorporated
on
March
00
,
0000
.

The
Harney
Peak
Hotel
remained
in
operation
until
0000
.

The
Building
has
been
restored
and
is
the
current
location
of
the
Alpine
Inn
.

This
building
is
on
the
List
of
Registered
Historic
Places
in
South
Dakota
.

The
Black
Hills
Institute
of
Geological
Research
opened
in
0000
and
is
involved
in
excavation
and
display
of
dinosaur
and
other
fossils
.

In
0000
the
institute
was
engaged
in
a
legal
battle
over
ownership
of
Tyrannosaurus
rex
fossil
named
"
Sue
"
.

Sue
controversy
On

,
0000
,
Sue
Hendrickson
,
an
American
paleontologist
working
for
the
Black
Hills
Institute
of
Geological
Research
discovered
the
fossil
of
what
would
become
the
most
complete
skeleton
of
a
Tyrannosaurus
Rex
ever
discovered
.

The
fossil
was
named
"
Sue
"
after
the
woman
who
discovered
it
.

After
discovery
,
excavation
,
and
transport
to
the
Institute
's
facilities
in
Hill
City
,
controversy
arose
as
to
who
the
rightful
owners
of
the
fossil
was
.

The
parties
in
dispute
were
the
land
owner
,
Maurice
Williams
,
the
tribe
-
and
thus
the
federal
government
,
and
the
Black
Hills
Institute
.

On
May
00
,
0000
FBI
agents
seized
Sue
from
the
Institute
over
the
course
of
three
days
.

The
fossil
was
shipped
to
South
Dakota
School
of
Mines
and
Technology
.

Through
the
ongoing
court
battle
it
was
finally
decided
that
Maurice
Williams
was
the
owner
of
the
fossil
.

The
federal
government
later
brought
a
00
count
000
charge
indictment
against
the
institute
and
several
of
its
members
which
was
related
to
this
case
and
other
fossils
.

This
case
turned
into
the
longest
criminal
trial
in
South
Dakota
state
history
.

Finally
Peter
Larson
the
president
of
the
institute
was
convicted
on
two
counts
of
customs
violations
for
which
he
served
two
years
in
federal
prison
.

Sue
was
finally
auctioned
off
by
Sotheby
's
auction
house
,
and
sold
by
Maurice
Williams
to
the
Field
Museum
in
Chicago
,
Illinois
for
0.00
million

Rapid
City
is
the
second-largest
city
in
the
state
of
South
Dakota
,
and
the
county
seat
of
Pennington
County
.

Named
after
Rapid
Creek
on
which
the
city
is
established
,
it
is
set
against
the
eastern
slope
of
the
Black
Hills
mountain
range
.

The
population
was
00,000
as
of
the
0000
Census
.

Rapid
City
is
known
as
the
"
Gateway
to
the
Black
Hills
"
and
the
"
City
of
Presidents
"
.

The
city
is
divided
by
a
mountain
range
that
splits
the
western
and
eastern
parts
of
the
city
into
two
.

History
The
public
discovery
of
gold
in
0000
by
the
Custer
Expedition
brought
a
mass
influx
of
settlers
into
the
Black
Hills
region
of
South
Dakota
.

Rapid
City
was
founded
(
and
originally
known
as
"
Hay
Camp
"
)
in
0000
by
a
group
of
disappointed
miners
,
who
promoted
their
new
city
as
the
"
Gateway
to
the
Black
Hills
.
"

John
Brennan
and
Samuel
Scott
,
with
a
small
group
of
men
,
laid
out
the
site
of
the
present
Rapid
City
in
February
0000
,
which
was
named
for
the
spring-fed
Rapid
Creek
that
flows
through
it
.

A
square
mile
was
measured
off
and
the
six
blocks
in
the
center
were
designated
as
a
business
section
.

Committees
were
appointed
to
bring
in
prospective
merchants
and
their
families
to
locate
in
the
new
settlement
.

The
city
soon
began
selling
supplies
to
miners
and
pioneers
.

Its
location
on
the
edge
of
the
Plains
and
Hills
and
its
large
river
valley
made
it
the
natural
hub
of
railroads
arriving
in
the
late
0000s
from
both
the
south
and
east
.

By
0000
,
Rapid
City
had
survived
a
boom
and
bust
and
was
establishing
itself
as
an
important
regional
trade
center
for
the
upper
midwest
.

Although
the
Black
Hills
became
a
popular
tourist
destination
in
the
late
0000s
,
it
was
a
combination
of
local
efforts
,
the
popularity
of
the
automobile
,
and
construction
of
improved
highways
that
brought
tourists
to
the
Black
Hills
in
large
numbers
after
World
War
I.
Gutzon
Borglum
,
already
a
famous
sculptor
,
began
work
on
Mount
Rushmore
in
0000
and
his
son
,
Lincoln
Borglum
,
continued
the
carving
of
the
presidents
'
faces
in
rock
following
his
father
's
death
in
0000
.

The
work
was
halted
due
to
pressures
leading
to
the
US
entry
into
World
War
II
and
the
massive
sculpture
was
declared
complete
in
0000
.

Although
tourism
sustained
the
city
throughout
the
Great
Depression
of
the
0000s
,
the
gas
rationing
of
World
War
II
had
a
devastating
effect
on
the
tourist
industry
in
the
town
,
but
this
was
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
war-related
growth
.

The
city
benefited
greatly
from
the
opening
of
Rapid
City
Army
Air
Base
,
later
Ellsworth
Air
Force
Base
,
an
Army
Air
Corps
training
base
.

As
a
result
,
the
population
of
the
area
nearly
doubled
between
0000
and
0000
,
from
almost
00,000
to
nearly
00,000
people
.

Military
families
and
civilian
personnel
soon
took
every
available
living
space
in
town
,
and
mobile
parks
proliferated
.

Rapid
City
businesses
profited
from
the
military
payroll
.

During
the
Cold
War
,
missile
installations
proliferated
in
the
area
:
a
series
of
Nike
Air
Defense
sites
were
constructed
around
Ellsworth
in
the
0000s
.

In
the
early
00s
the
construction
of
three
Titan
(
rocket
family
)
missile
launch
sites
containing
a
total
of
nine
Titan
I
missiles
in
the
general
vicinity
of
Rapid
City
took
place
.

Beginning
in
November
0000
,
the
land
for
a
hundred
miles
east
,
northeast
and
northwest
of
the
city
was
dotted
with
000
Minuteman
missile
silo
s
and
00
launch
command
centers
,
all
of
which
were
deactivated
in
the
early
0000s
.

In
0000
,
city
officials
envisioned
the
city
as
a
retail
and
wholesale
trade
center
for
the
region
and
designed
a
plan
for
growth
that
focused
on
a
civic
center
,
more
downtown
parking
places
,
new
schools
,
and
paved
streets
.

A
construction
boom
continued
into
the
0000s
.

Growth
slowed
in
the
0000s
,
but
the
worst
natural
disaster
in
South
Dakota
history
,
the
Black
Hills
Flood
led
to
another
building
boom
a
decade
later
.

On
June
0
,
0000
,
heavy
rains
caused
massive
flooding
of
the
Rapid
Creek
.

More
than
000
people
lost
their
lives
and
more
than
$
000
million
in
property
was
destroyed
.

The
devastation
of
the
flood
and
the
outpouring
of
private
donations
and
millions
of
dollars
in
federal
aid
led
to
the
completion
of
one
big
part
of
the
0000
plan
:
clearing
the
area
along
the
Rapid
Creek
and
making
it
a
public
park
.

New
homes
and
businesses
were
constructed
to
replace
those
that
had
been
destroyed
.

Rushmore
Plaza
Civic
Center
and
a
new
Central
High
School
were
built
in
part
of
the
area
that
had
been
cleared
.

The
new
Central
High
School
opened
in
0000
,
with
the
graduating
class
in
that
year
straddling
both
the
original
Central
(
housed
in
what
is
now
Dakota
Middle
School
)
and
the
new
Central
.

The
rebuilding
in
part
insulated
Rapid
City
from
the
drop
in
automotive
tourism
caused
by
the
Oil
Embargo
in
0000
,
but
tourism
was
depressed
for
most
of
a
decade
.

In
0000
,
Rushmore
Mall
was
built
on
the
north
edge
of
the
city
,
adding
to
the
city
's
position
as
a
retail
shopping
center
.

In
0000
in
United
States
v.
Sioux
Nation
of
Indians
,
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
ruled
that
the
government
of
the
United
States
had
illegally
stolen
the
Black
Hills
from
the
Sioux
people
when
the
government
unilaterally
broke
the
treaty
that
guaranteed
the
Black
Hills
belonged
to
the
Sioux
.

The
court
decision
offered
money
,
but
the
Sioux
declined
on
principle
that
the
theft
of
their
land
should
not
be
validated
,
and
still
demand
the
return
of
the
land
.

This
land
includes
Rapid
City
,
which
is
by
far
the
largest
modern
settlement
in
the
Black
Hills
.

As
of
0000
,
the
dispute
has
not
been
settled
.

In
the
0000s
,
growth
was
fueled
by
an
increase
in
tourism
,
increasingly
tied
to
the
Sturgis
Motorcycle
Rally
,
followed
by
another
decline
in
the
late
0000s
.

Fears
for
the
closure
of
Ellsworth
AFB
as
part
of
the
massive
base
closure
process
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
led
to
attempts
to
expand
other
sectors
of
the
economy
,
but
growth
continued
and
the
city
expanded
significantly
during
this
period
.

Today
,
Rapid
City
is
South
Dakota
's
primary
city
for
tourism
and
recreation
.

With
the
approval
of
a
Deep
Underground
Science
and
Engineering
Laboratory
at
the
Homestake
Mine
site
in
nearby
Lead
,
Rapid
City
has
a
future
of
great
advancements
in
technology
,
medicine
,
and
scientific
research
.

0000
Rapid
Creek
Flood
On
June
0
–
00
,
0000
,
extremely
heavy
rains
over
the
eastern
Black
Hills
of
South
Dakota
produced
record
floods
on
Rapid
Creek
and
other
streams
in
the
area
.

Nearly
of
rain
fell
in
about
0
hours
near
Nemo
,
and
more
than
of
rain
fell
over
an
area
of
.

According
to
the
Red
Cross
,
the
resulting
peak
floods
(
which
occurred
after
dark
)
left
000
people
dead
and
0,000
people
injured
.

In
addition
to
the
human
tragedy
,
total
damage
was
estimated
in
excess
of
$
000
million
(
about
$
000
million
in
0000
dollars
)
,
which
included
0,000
homes
and
0,000
automobiles
that
were
destroyed
.

Runoff
from
this
storm
produced
record
floods
(
highest
peak
flows
recorded
)
along
Battle
,
Spring
,
Rapid
,
and
Box
Elder
Creeks
.

Smaller
floods
also
occurred
along
Elk
Creek
and
Bear
Butte
Creek
.

Canyon
Lake
Dam
,
on
the
west
side
of
Rapid
City
,
broke
the
night
of
the
flood
,
unleashing
a
wall
of
water
down
the
creek
.

The
0000
flooding
has
an
estimated
recurrence
interval
of
000
years
,
which
means
that
a
flood
of
this
magnitude
will
occur
on
average
once
every
000
years
.

Every
year
there
is
a
0.0
percent
chance
(
0
in
000
)
of
experiencing
a
similar
event
.

To
prevent
a
similar
tragedy
from
occurring
in
the
future
,
the
city
's
flood
plain
is
no
longer
allowed
to
be
built
upon
.

Today
the
flood
plain
features
golf
courses
,
parks
,
sports
arenas
,
and
arboretums
where
neighborhoods
and
businesses
once
stood
.

In
0000
,
the
Rapid
City
Public
Library
created
a
0000
Flood
digital
archive
that
collects
survivors
'
stories
,
photos
and
news
accounts
of
the
flood
.

The
Journey
Museum
has
an
interactive
display
on
the
0000
flood
which
is
an
ongoing
project
to
give
future
generations
the
best
idea
of
how
the
people
were
affected
and
the
changes
made
to
it
because
of
the
loss
of
000
lives
.

It
will
in
the
future
include
the
biographies
of
all
of
those
who
died
so
they
will
be
remembered
as
more
than
names
on
a
memorial
.

Geography
Rapid
City
is
located
at
.

The
downtown
elevation
of
Rapid
City
is
0,000
feet
(
000

)
and
Rapid
City
sits
in
the
shadow
of
Harney
Peak
;
which
at
,
is
the
highest
point
east
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
.

According
to
the
United

,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
00.00
square

.

Rapid
City
is
located
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
Black
Hills
,
and
is
split
in
half
by
the
Dakota
Hogback
.

Rapid
City
's
"
Westside
"
is
located
in
the
Red
Valley
between
the
foothills
of
the
Black
Hills
proper
and
the
Dakota
Hogback
,
so
named
for
the
red
Spearfish
formation
soils
and
the
way
the
valley
completely
circles
the
Black
Hills
.

Rapid
City
has
grown
up
into
the
foothills
,
with
both
ridges
and
valleys
developed
,
especially
in
the
last
00
years
,
and
wildfire
is
a
distinct
threat
to
these
residential
areas
,
as
shown
by
the
Westberry
Trails
fire
in
0000
.

Skyline
Drive
follows
the
summits
of
the
Dakota
Hogback
south
from
near
Rapid
Gap
(
where
Rapid
Creek
cuts
through
the
Hogback
)
to
a
large
high
plateau
which
forms
the
current
south
edge
of
Rapid
City
.

The
Central
and
Eastern
portions
of
Rapid
City
lie
in
the
wide
valley
of
Rapid
Creek
outside
the
Hogback
,
which
includes
a
number
of
mesas
rising
a
hundred
feet
or
more
above
the
floodplain
.

Rapid
Creek
Rapid
Creek
flows
through
Rapid
City
,
emerging
from
Dark
Canyon
above
Canyon
Lake
and
flowing
in
a
large
arc
north
of
Downtown
.

Rapid
Creek
descends
to
the
southeast
as
the
valley
widens
.

The
floodplain
of
Rapid
Creek
is
mostly
a
series
of
parks
,
arboretums
,
and
bike
trails
,
one
legacy
of
the
Black
Hills
Flood
of
0000
.

To
the
north
,
a
series
of
ridges
separates
Rapid
Creek
from
Box
Elder
Creek
,
with
large
older
and
new
residential
areas
and
commercial
areas
along
I-00
.

To
the
south
,
the
terrain
rises
more
steeply
to
the
southern
widening
of
the
Dakota
Hogback
into
a
plateau
dividing
the
Rapid

drainage
from
Spring
Creek
.

Climate
Rapid
City
features
a
steppe
climate
(
Köppen
BSk
)
.

Its
location
makes
its
climate
unlike
both
the
higher
elevations
of
the
Black
Hills
and
the
Great
Plains
to
the
east
.

It
is
characterized
by
long
arid
summers
and
long
dry
winters
,
with
short
but
distinct
spring
and
autumn
seasons
.

Winters
are
cold
and
dry
,
with
December
,
with
a
daily
average
temperature
of
,
being
the
coldest
month
in
recent
years
;
however
,
Chinook
winds
can
warm
temperatures
above
,
doing
so
on
average
about
00
times
from
December
to
February
.

Temperature
inversions
,
however
,
occasionally
produce
warmer
temperatures
in
the
Black
Hills
.

The
low
temperature
reaches
on
an
average
00
nights
.

Snowfall
is
frequent
but
usually
not
heavy
;
March
and
April
are
typically
the
snowiest
months
,
and
the
seasonal
total
averages
.

Extensive
snow
cover
does
not
remain
for
long
,
with
only
0
days
per
year
of
or
more
on
the
ground
.

Compared
to
locations
in
the
east
,
spring
warms
rather
gradually
,
with
snow
activity
generally
ceasing
by
May
and
precipitation
totals
beginning
to
increase
.

In
the
latter
half
of
spring
,
storms
typically
develop
over
the
Black
Hills
during
the
afternoon
and
move
onto
the
plains
in
the
evening
.

However
,
Rapid
City
still
sees
an
average
of
00
clear
to
partly
cloudy
days
and
00
percent
of
its
possible
sunshine
in
June
.

This
is
the
traditional
"
flood
"
season
for
Rapid
and
other
creeks
in
the
Eastern
Hills
.

Temperatures
warm
rapidly
as
summer
approaches
.

Summer
in
Rapid
City
is
hot
,
relatively
dry
,
and
sunny
.

July
is
the
warmest

average
temperature
of
.

There
is
an
average
of
00
days
with
+
highs
and
0.0

.

Due
to
the
elevation
and
aridity
,
lows
rarely
remain
at
or
above
and
during
summer
occasionally
lower
to

Rapid
City
records
an
average

Sister
cities
Industry
and
economy
Rapid

a
major
portion
of
the
Rapid
City
economy
,
due
to
the
proximity
of
Mount
Rushmore
,
Sturgis
,
home
of
the
Sturgis
Motorcycle
Rally
,

,
and
other

's
demand
for

,
camp
sites
,
and
other
services
for
tourists
during
the
first
week
of
August
means
that
Rapid

has
the
capacity
to
host
large
conventions

large
numbers
of

year-round
.

a
major
transportation
hub
for
the
Northern
Plains
.

the
airline
hub
cities
of
Denver

Historically
,
Rapid
City
was
served
by
three
Railroads
.

Presently
,
the
city
is
served
by
the
Dakota
Minnesota
and
Eastern
Railroad
(
DM&E
)
,
now
owned
by
the
Canadian
Pacific
Railway
.

The
DM&E
serves
the
Northern
Black
Hills
and
heads
south
into
Nebraska
.

DM&E
lines
run
east
to
Minnesota
and
south
through
Nebraska
to
connect
with
major
transcontinental
railroads
Burlington
Northern
Santa
Fe
and
Union
Pacific
.

South
Dakota
does
not
have
Amtrak
service
,
one
of
the
few
states
that
does
n't
.

Rapid
City
's
central
location
allows
easy
transport
of
products
to
both
coasts
,
and
trucking
is
a
major
business
activity
in
the
city
.

Improved
connections
with
Denver
and
I-00
to
the
south
,
via
the
Heartland
Expressway
now
under
construction
will
primarily
benefit
local
trucking
.

Rapid
City

the
Western

power
grids
,
together
with
the
hydroelectric
plants
of
the
Mainstem
Dams
on
the
Missouri
River
and
the
large
coal
fields
and
power
plants
of
the
Powder
River
Basin
of
Wyoming
make
it
one
of
the
points
where
the
two
national
power
grids
connect
with
each
other
,
allowing
switching
of
electrical
power
from
east
to
west
and
vice

,
but
also
obtains
much
of
its
power
from
both
the
Missouri
dams
and
power
stations
near
Gillette
,
Wyoming
.

Electrical
rates
are
considered
relatively
low

Rapid
City
obtains
most
of
its
water
supply
from
Rapid
Creek
and
the
alluvial
aquifers
associated
with
the
creek
,
owning
significant
water
rights
in
Pactola
Reservoir
located
some
west
of
the
city
,
but
does
also
obtain
water
from
some
springs
in
the
vicinity
,
and
has
the
ability
to
draw
water
from
deep
formations
which
receive
water
from
recharge
in
areas
of
the
Black
Hills
where
the
formations
come
to
the
surface
.

The
heavy
dependence
on
shallow
alluvial
aquifers
is
of
some
concern
to
planners
,
as
most
suburbs
of
Rapid
City
use
septic
systems
for
domestic
sewage
treatment
.

However
,
water
supplies
remain
relatively
good
for
future
growth

operate
in
the

announced
on

,
0000
that
area
north
of
Elk
Point
,
near
Spink
,
was
a
finalist
for
a
new
oil
refinery
.

The
facility
,
which
would
process
of
oil
a
day
and
use
of
water
daily
from
the
Missouri
River
,
has
caused
significant
controversy
among
concerned
residents
of
Elk
Point
and
the
surrounding
area
.

Prior
to
the
announcement
,
the
project
was
kept
under
considerable
secrecy
,
and
was
known
only
as
"
Project
Gorilla
"
while
Hyperion
made
several
purchase
agreements
on
land
north
and
east
of
Elk
Point
.

Elk
Point
is
the
forerunner
among
three
other
out-of-state
locations
Hyperion
is
considering
for
construction
of
the
massive
,
refinery
.

Opponents
are
concerned
about

,
water
,
and
noise
pollution
;
environmental
degradation
of
nearby
food
crops
such
as
soy
beans
,

;
negative

market
and
competition

;
displacement
of
some
local
residents
and
population
resettling
;
potential
industrial
disasters
including
explosions
,
leaks
,
and
spills
,
reminiscent
of
the
recent
explosion
at
a
similar-capacity
Texas
City
Oil
Refinery
that
caused
the
deaths
of
00
workers
and
injured
over
000
;
contamination
potential
threats
of
terrorism
;
and
concerns
of
the
sheer
size
of
the
facility
,
which
will
be
over
twice
the
area
of
Elk
Point
itself
.

Supporters
argue
that
the
facility
will
bring
a
much-needed
economic
boost
to
the
Union
County
area
,
and
would
create
over
0,000
new
construction
jobs
and
employ
0,000
full-time
workers
once
completed
.

Hyperion
representatives
have

History
Prehistoric
Native
American
habitation
was
not
uncommon
throughout
the
Clinch
valley
,
especially
during
the
Woodland
period
(
0000
B.C.
-
0000
A.D.
)
and
the
Mississippian
period
(
0000-0000
A.D.
)
.

A
number
of
such
habitation
sites
were
excavated
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
in
anticipation
of
the
construction
of
Norris
Dam
and
Melton
Hill
Dam
,
respectively
.

The
Melton
Hill
excavations
uncovered
two
substantial
Woodland
period
villages
along
the
Clinch
at
Bull
Bluff
and
Freels
Bend
,
both
approximately
downstream
from
Clinton
.

By
the
time
Euro-American
explorers
and
long
hunters
arrived
in
the
Clinch
valley
in
the
mid-00th
century
,
what
is
now
Anderson
County
was
part
of
a
vast
stretch
of
land
claimed
by
the
Cherokee
.

Although
the
Treaty
of
Holston
,
signed
in
0000
,
was
intended
as
a
negotiation
with
the
Cherokee
to
prohibit
settlement
of
the
area
including
what
is
today
Anderson
County
,
the
treaty
became
ineffective
as
more
settlers
moved
through
the
Appalachian
Mountains
from
Virginia
and
North
Carolina
into
Tennessee
.

The
earliest
settlers
in
Anderson
County
included
the
Wallace
,
Gibbs
,
Freels
,
Frost
and
Tunnell
families
.

The
flooding
of
white
settlers
into
the
Indian
domain
was
cause
for
several
skirmishes
,
which
eased
after
the
Treaty
of
Tellico
in
0000
(
including
an
origination
point
for
the
land
to
be
relinquished
from
the
Cherokee
being
the
Tellico
Blockhouse
)
allowed
for
greater
ease
in
settling
the
area
.

Founded
in
0000
,
the
town
of
Burrville
was
named
in
honor
of
Aaron
Burr
,
first
term
Vice
President
under
Thomas
Jefferson
.

Land
was
selected
and
partitioned
for
a
courthouse
,
and
Burrville
was
designated
as
the
county
seat
for
the
newly
formed
Anderson
County
,
Tennessee
.

Anderson
County
was
partitioned
from
a
portion
of
Grainger
County
,
Tennessee
as
well
as
a
portion
of
Knox
County
,
Tennessee
,
in
0000
;
neighboring
Roane
County
,
Tennessee
,
was
also
formed
from
a
portion
of
Knox
County
,
Tennessee
,
in
0000
,
making
Anderson
and
Roane
counties
effectively
called
'
sister
counties
'
.

On
November
0
,
0000
,
by
act
of
Tennessee
State
Legislature
,
the
town
of
Burrville
was
renamed
because
of
the
disgrace
of
the
Burr-Hamilton
duel
,
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
Alexander
Hamilton
.

The
selection
of
the
name
"
Clinton
"
was
most
likely
to
honor
George
Clinton
or
his
nephew
,
DeWitt
Clinton
.

George
Clinton
was
one
of
Burr
's
New
York
political
rivals
who
,
along
with
Alexander
Hamilton
,
destroyed
Burr
's
bid
for
the
governorship
of
the
state
of
New
York
after
his
single-term
Vice
Presidency
.

George
Clinton
succeeded
Burr
as
the
second-term
Vice
President
for
Thomas
Jefferson
in
0000
(
and
also
served
as
James
Madison
's
Vice
President
,
making
Clinton
the
first
Vice
President
to
serve
under
two
presidents
and
the
first
Vice
President
to
die
in
office
)
.

Because
of
the
political
position
of
George
Clinton
as
Vice
President
at
the
time
of
Burrville
's
name
change
,
compared
to
DeWitt
Clinton
's
position
as
the
mayor
of
New
York
City
,
most
likely
the
residents
of
the
town
of
Burrville
would
have
been
more
readily
identifiable
and
more
honorable
toward
George
Clinton
than
DeWitt
;
therefore
,
it
is
most
likely
Clinton
was
named
after
George
Clinton
,
barring
historical
proof
.

The
Clinton
High
School
desegregation
controversy
In
0000
,
Clinton
gained
national
attention
when
segregationists
opposed
the
desegregation
of
Clinton
High
School
.

Following
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
decision
in
the
case
of
Brown
v.
Board
of
Education
,
a
court
order
required
the
desegregation
of
the
high
school
.

Twelve
African-American
students
enrolled
in
the
high
school
in
the
fall
of
0000
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
Clinton
Twelve
attended
classes
at
Clinton
High
School
for
the
first
time
,
becoming
the
first
African-Americans
to
desegregate
a
state-supported
public
school
in
the
Southeast
.

While
the
first
day
of
classes
occurred
without
incident
,
pro-segregation
forces
led
by
John
Kasper
and
Asa
Carter
arrived
in
Clinton
the
following
week
and
rallied
the
city
's
white
citizens
.

Riots
broke
out
in
early
September
,
forcing
Governor
Frank
G.
Clement
to
station
National
Guard
units
in
Clinton
throughout
September
.

Sporadic
violence
and
threats
continued
for
the
next
two
years
,
culminating
in
the
bombing
of
Clinton
High
School
on
October

With
an
influx
of
outside
aid
,
however

the

Rogers
Group
quarry
and
asphalt
plant
controversy
In
the
0000s
,
the
Rogers
Group
—
a
firm
specializing
in
road
paving
—
began
a
campaign
to
reactivate
an
abandoned
quarry
and
build
an
asphalt
plant
just
east
of
Clinton
near
the
community
of
Bethel
.

The
initiative
met
with
opposition
from
local
and
environmental
groups
,
who
were
concerned
that
the
plant
would
release
cancer-causing
toxins
into
nearby
residential
neighborhoods
.

Others
were
concerned
about
plummeting
property
values
,
noise
pollution
,
damage
from
rock
blasting
,
and
environmental
damage
to
Buffalo
Creek
.

The
company
argued
that
it
would
follow
stringent
environmental
and
pollution
guidelines
,
retention
ponds
would
limit
runoff
,
and
that
the
site
would
be
surrounded
by
vegetation
.

Nevertheless
,
Anderson
County
refused
to
rezone
the
quarry
property
for
industrial
uses
,
and
Rogers
Group
sued
the
county
in
0000
.

In
December
0000
,
after
Rogers
Group
's
lawsuit
had
stagnated
,
the
city
of
Clinton
voted
to
annex
the
quarry
property
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
Clinton
City
Council
voted
0-0
to
rezone
the
quarry
property
for
industrial
uses
,
paving
the
way
for
the
plant
's
construction
.

In
response
,
a
local
advocacy
group
known
as
Citizens
for
Safety
and
Clean
Air
filed
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
several
Bethel
residents
in
Anderson
County
Chancery
Court
contending
that
the
council
's
rezoning
was
unconstitutional
and
seeking
an
injunction
preventing
the
council
from
rezoning
the
property
as
an
industrial
zone
.

Norris
is
a
city
in
Anderson
County
,
Tennessee
,
United
States
.

Its
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
included
in
the
Knoxville
,
Tennessee
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Norris
was
built
as
a
model
planned
community
by
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
(
TVA
)
in
0000
to
house
workers
building
Norris
Dam
.

It
is
named
in
honor
of
Nebraska
Senator
George
W.
Norris
,
a
long-term
supporter
of
TVA
.

TVA
chairman
Arthur
Morgan
envisioned
Norris
as
a
model
of
cooperative
,
egalitarian
living
.

The
city
design
was
developed
by
TVA
staff
,
who
loosely
based
their
design
on
the
English
garden
city
movement
of
the
0000s
.

Winding
roads
followed
the
contour
of
the
terrain
.

Houses
did
not
always
face
the
street
.

A
central
common
green
and
a
belt
of
rural
land
around
the
town
were
reserved
for
use
by
residents
.

The
houses
,
which
were
some
of
the
first
all-electric
homes
,
were
built
using
local
wood
and
stone
,
according
to
twelve
basic
house
designs
that
each
included
a
porch
and
fireplace
.

Different
exterior
materials
were
used
for
visual
variety
.

Norris
represents
the
first
use
of
greenbelt
design
principles
in
a
self-contained
town
in
the
United
States
.

The
town
was
the
first
in
Tennessee
to
have
a
complete
system
of
dial
telephone
s.
Norris
Creamery
was
the
first
milk-producing
plant
in
the
world
to
be
powered
solely
by
electricity
.

During
the
0000s
TVA
officials
excluded
black
families
from
the
city
,
purportedly
to
conform
to
the
customs
and
traditions
of
the
area
.

However
,
black
leaders
said
that
poor
whites
and
blacks
had
lived
and
worked
together
in
the
area
long
before
TVA
came
into
existence
.

The
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
(
NAACP
)
complained
repeatedly
(
in
0000
,
0000
and
0000
)
about
racial
discrimination
by
TVA
in
the
hiring
,
housing
and
training
of
blacks
.

In
0000
the
U.S.
Congress
directed
that
the
city
be
sold
at
public
auction
.

It
was
purchased
for
0.0
million
by
a
Philadelphia
investment
group
headed
by
Henry
D.
Epstein
,
which
then
sold
individual
homes
to
their
residents
.

The
city
was
officially
incorporated
in
0000
.

In
0000
the
Epstein
group
sold
its
remaining
Norris
real
estate
to
a
corporation
formed
by
Norris
residents
and
known
as
the
Norris
Corporation
.

The
town
,

found
a
tree
with
carvings
of
a
cow
bell

a
buckle
,
possibly
carved
by
Indians
to
warn
white

away
,

carved
by

s

creek
was
named
Bell
Buckle
Creek

Buckle
area
was

Economy
Camden
and
Benton
County
function
on
primarily
an
agrarian
economy
,
and
Camden
serves
as
a
bedroom
community
for
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
facility
and
the
DuPont
titanium
dioxide
production
plant
in
New
Johnsonville
,
five

and
on
the
opposite

of
the
Tennessee
River
.

In

were
known
for
sorghum
production
;
however
,
the
last
sorghum
production
facility
shut
down

Tourism
,
however
,
is
quickly
supplanting
it

with
the
well-promoted
Tennessee

Camden
area
as
early
as
Archaic
period
(
0000-0000

History
The
Sequatchie
Valley
was
part
of
Cherokee
lands
until
0000
,
when
the
Cherokee
ceded
it
to
the
U.S.
as
part
of
the
Treaty
of
Tellico
.

The
valley
was
probably
named
after
a
Cherokee
chief
,
but
the
name
has
also
been
rumored
to
mean
"
beautiful
valley
"
in
the
Cherokee
language
.

By
the
late
00th
century
,
the
valley
had
been
identified
by
long
hunters
,
one
of
whom
,
Anthony
Bledsoe
,
became
the
county
's
namesake
.

Bledsoe
County
was
formed
in
0000
,
with
the
town
of
Madison
as
its
county
seat
.

Pikeville
was
established
in
0000
on
lands
donated
by
Charles
Love
,
an
early
Sequatchie
settler
.

The
origin
of
the
town
's
name
is
unknown
,
although
some
have
suggested
that
it
was
named
for
explorer
General
Zebulon
Pike
.

By
0000
,
the
Bledsoe
County
seat
had
been
moved
from
Madison
to
Pikeville
.

The
town
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

J.V.
Wigle
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
a
combustion
engineer
from
Michigan
and
laboratory
assistant
at
Eastern
Michigan
State
,
met
a
local
woman
,
Mattie
Lawson
,
and
settled
down
in
Pikeville
.

He
first
brought
electricity
to
town
when
he
electrified
the
house
where
he
lived
near
the
corner
of
Poplar
and
Wiegle
streets
.

(
Wiegle
Street
,
named
after
J.V.
Wigle
,
is
misspelled
)
Later
electricity
was
brought
to
other
parts
of
Pikeville
.

In
addition
to
bringing
electricity
to
Pikeville
,
Wigle
bottled
Coca-Cola
and
made
wrought
iron
railings
in
the
community
.

He
was
granted
two
U.S.
patents
in
0000
(
0,000,000
&
0,000,000
)
for
a
coin
selecting
device
and
a
braking
mechanism
.

His
two
sons
attended
the
engineering
school
at
Vanderbilt
University
.

His
son
Tom
(
0000

,
helped
build
U.S.
Route

heading
north
out
of
town
as
it
rises
up
the
mountain
near
the
county

Alcoa
is
a
city
in
Blount
County
,
Tennessee
,
United
States
,
south
of
Knoxville
.

Its
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Knoxville
,
Tennessee
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

As
its
name
suggests
,
Alcoa
is
the
site
of
a
large
aluminum
smelting
plant
owned
and
operated
by
the
Alcoa
corporation
.

Formerly
known
as
North
Maryville
,
the
town
was
incorporated
under
its
present
name
in
0000
.

History
Early
company
town
Shortly
after
the
Pittsburgh
Reduction
Company
changed
its
name
to
the
Aluminum
Company
of
America
in
0000
,
the
company
began
investigating
the
possibility
of
establishing
a
large
smelting
operation
in
East
Tennessee
.

The
hydroelectric
potential
of
the
Little
Tennessee
River
,
which
exits
the
mountains
about
southwest
of
Alcoa
,
was
one
of
the
primary
incentives
,
as
the
company
's
aluminum
smelting
operation
would
require
massive
amounts
of
electricity
.

In
0000
,
the
company
established
a
base
camp
at
what
is
now
known
as
Calderwood
,
but
was
initially
known
as
"
Alcoa
,
"
and
would
be
known
as
such
until
the
name
was
reapplied
to
the
company
's
operations
in
North
Maryville
a
few
years
later
.

The
company
considered
several
potential
plant
sites
in
Knoxville
,
Etowah
,
and
Monroe
County
,
but
chose
North
Maryville
due
in
part
to
the
influence
of
Maryville
mayor
Samuel
Everett
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

By
0000
,
the
company
had
completed
the
initial
purchase
of
in
North
Maryville
,
and
had
initiated
construction
of
the
smelting
plant
and
000
houses
for
company
employees
.

ALCOA
's
chief
engineer
Edwin
Fickes
and
hydraulic
engineer
Robert
Ewald
drew
up
plans
for
the
town
to
house
the
plant
's
workers
.

The
town
design
initially
called
for
the
acquisition
of
,
and
included
four
sections
—
Vose
and
Springbrook
in
the
north
(
around
what
is
now
Springbrook
Park
)
and
Bassel
and
Hall
in
the
south
(
around
what
is
now
the
South
Plant
)
.

Hall
,
named
for
the
inventor
of
the
aluminum
electrolytic
process
,
was
originally
a
segregated
community
for
the
plant
's
African-American
workers
.

Oldfield
,
a
small
community
between
the
planned
town
and
Maryville
,
would
later
be
annexed
by
the
city
of
Alcoa
.

World
War
I
brought
about
a
spike
in
the
demand
for
aluminum
,
and
the
company
quickly
expanded
its
North
Maryville
operations
.

In
0000
,
a
rolling
mill
(
now
West
Plant
)
was
completed
,
and
the
company
purchased
the
Knoxville
Power
Company
for
its
Little
Tennessee
Valley
holdings
.

That
same
year
,
the
company
's
town
officially
incorporated
as
"
Alcoa
.
"

C.L.
Babcock
was
the
town
's
first
mayor
,
and
Victor
Hultquist
was
the
first
city
manager
.

Hultquist
,
who
was
also
ALCOA
's
superintendent
of
construction
,
remained
city
manager
until
0000
,
and
oversaw
much
of
the
town
's
early
development
.

In
0000
,
Alcoa
had
a
population
of
0,000
people
living
in
000
houses
.

The
Great
Depression
and
World
War
II
Early
Alcoa
was
a
classic
"
company
town
,
"
with
the
company
maintaining
a
paternalistic
relationship
with
the
city
.

The
city
's
welfare
was
almost
wholly
dependent
upon
the
company
's
fortunes
.

This
presented
a
problem
for
the
company
,
which
feared
that
its
workforce
would
leave
to
look
for
jobs
elsewhere
during
times
of
low
production
.

Thus
,
during
the
Great
Depression
,
the
company
maintained
steady
production
levels
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
demand
for
aluminum
.

Managers
sought
to
cut
workers
'
hours
—
which
at
one
point
dropped
to
00
hours
per
week
—
rather
than
slash
jobs
.

By
the
end
of
the
decade
,
the
company
had
stockpiled
00,000
tons
of
aluminum
.

The
Depression
(
and
accompanying
New
Deal
legislation
)
also
brought
about
increased
labor
union
activity
in
Alcoa
.

A
strike
in
0000
was
forcibly
ended
when
Hultquist
deployed
a

A
second
strike
in
0000
was
broken
in
a
similar
fashion
,
with
two
striking
workers
shot
and
killed
and
the
National
Guard
forced
to
intervene
.

World
War
II
proved
immensely
profitable
for
ALCOA
,
as
aluminum
was
needed
for
aircraft
construction
.

Production
increased
000
%
during
the
war
,
and
the
company
's
Alcoa
operations
workforce
swelled
to
00,000
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
company
built
its
North
Plant
,
which
at
the
time
of
its
completion
was
the
world
's
largest
plant
under
a
single
roof
.

Modern
Alcoa
After
World
War
II
,
the
city
of
Alcoa
became
less
and
less
dependent
upon
its
parent
company
.

ALCOA
's
public
image
had
suffered
due
to
its
hardline
stance
toward
labor
unions
,
and
in
response
,
it
launched
a
series
of
public
relations
initiatives
,
including
the
donation
of
land
for
schools
,
parks
,
and
airport
construction
.

The
company
also
desegregated
its
facilities
during
this
period
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
company
began
selling
off
company
housing
to
employees
.

In
0000
,
Ross
Walker
became
the
first
city
manager
who
was
not
employed
by
the
company
,
and
toward
the
end
of
the
decade
,
the
company
had
relinquished
ownership
of
city
utilities
.

The
completion
of
the
Hall
Road
Viaduct
in
the
0000s
and
the
continued
development
of
McGhee
Tyson
Airport
over
subsequent
decades
led
to
commercial
expansion
and
helped
the
city
diversify
its
economy
.

History
The

History
When
the
first
Euro-American
explorers
arrived
in
the
area
,
they
found
the
Great
Indian
Warpath
,
which
ran
along
the
route
where
the
modern
US-000
has
been
built
.

It
was
long
used
by
the
indigenous
people
s
of
the
area
.

A
historic
Cherokee
village
known
as
Elajay
was
situated
at
the
confluence
of
Ellejoy
Creek
(
named
after
the
village
)
and
Little
River
.

Its
site
was
near
the
modern
Heritage
High
School
.

Ensign
Henry
Timberlake
passed
through
the
village
in
0000
while
returning
from
his
expedition
to
the
Overhill
villages
to
the
west
.

He
reported
that
it
had
been
abandoned
.

In
0000
,
Revolutionary
War
veteran
John
Craig
built
a
wooden
palisade
enclosing
cabins
at
what
is
known
as
Fort
Craig
(
or
Craig
's
Station
)
at
present-day
Maryville
.

Such
stations
were
built
throughout
the
frontier
to
defend
settlers
against
attacks
from
the
Cherokee
.
"

On
April
00
,
0000
,
when
settlers
believed
Indian
attacks
were
imminent
,
000
men
,
women
,
and
children
gathered
in
small
huts
at
John
Craig
's
station
on
Nine
Mile
Creek
.
"

Craig
donated
00
acres
(
000,000
m
²
)
next
to
his
fort
for
the
founding
of
a
new
town
.

Incorporated
as
a
city
on
July
00
,
0000
,
the
settlement
was
named
in
honor
of
Mary
Grainger
Blount
,
wife
of
the
territorial
governor
William
Blount
.

Blount
County
was
named
after
him
.

The
family
of
Sam
Houston
moved
to
Maryville
from
Virginia
in
0000
,
when
Houston
was
00
.

His
older
brothers
put
him
to
work
as
a
clerk
in
a
store
they
established
in
town
,
but
he
ran
away
.

Houston
lived
for
a
few
years
with
the
Cherokee
at
Hiwassee
Island
,
on
the
Hiwassee
River
,
where
he
became
fluent
in
their
language
and
appreciative
of
their
culture
.

After
his
return
to
Maryville
about
0000
,
Houston
started
a
one-room
schoolhouse
.

He
signed
up
for
the
army
during
the
War
of
0000
and
rose
rapidly
in
rank
,
beginning
his
military
and
political
career
.

The
schoolhouse
still
stands
just
off
US-000
near
the
community
of
Wildwood
.

Maryville
was
a
center
of
abolitionist
activity
throughout
the
early
00th-century
;
it
was
generated
mostly
by
the
Society
of
Friends
,
which
had
a
relatively
large
presence
in
Blount
County
.

They
were
supported
by
anti-slavery
advocates
such
as
Isaac
L.
Anderson
,
the
founder
of
Maryville
College
.

When
Tennessee
voted
on
the
Ordinance
of
Secession
in
0000
,
only
00
%
of
Blount
Countians
voted
in
favor
of
seceding
from
the
Union
.

Although
staunchly
pro-Union
throughout
the
Civil
War
,
Maryville
was
not
liberated
by
federal
troops
until
May
0000
.

In
August
of
that
year
,
a
Confederate
cavalry
raid
,
under
the
command
of
General
Joseph
Wheeler
,
attacked
the
courthouse
where
the
Union
troops
had
taken
shelter
.

To
try
to
dislodge
the
federal
soldiers
,
Confederates
set
fire
to
several
buildings
,
including
a
store
where
the
city
's
records
were
being
kept
.

Polly
Tool
,
an
African-American
slave
,
rescued
most
of
the
records
.

She
was
honored
by
a
statue
in
the
Blount
County
courthouse
.

In
0000
,
Maryville
elected
W.B.
Scott
,
the
second
African-American
mayor
in
U.S.
history
.

In
the
0000s
,
after
several
department
stores
and
other
retailers
moved
from
the
downtown
area
to
Alcoa
's
Midland
shopping
center
,
the
city
spent
$
00
million
on
a
renewal
project
called
"
Now
Town
.
"

Traffic
was
re-routed
,
facades
were
placed
on
old
buildings
,
slum
s
were
cleared
,
and
the
Bicentennial
Greenbelt
Park
was
created
.

The
project
failed
to
attract
business
back
to
the
downtown
locations
;
instead
retailers
moved
to
the
new
Foothills
Mall
a
few
years
later
.

The
downtown
area
remained
in
decline
until
the
0000s
(
decade
)
,
when
the
city
agreed
to
reverse
many
of
the
"
Now
Town
"
changes
.

Mountains
National
Park
and
the
home
of
several
museums
and
attractions
relating
to
the
natural
and
human
history
of
the
Great
Smokies
.

Dubbing
itself
"
The
Peaceful
Side
of
the
Smokies
,
"
Townsend
has
the
least
traffic
of
the
three
main
entrances
to
the
national
park
.

The
park
's
other
two
entrances
—
one
just
south
of
Gatlinburg
,
Tennessee
,
and
the
other
just
north
of
Cherokee
,
North
Carolina
—
are
home
to
multiple
commercial
attractions
that
draw
millions
of
tourists
annually
.

Townsend
is
low-key
,
with
a
handful
of
inexpensive
restaurants
and
motels
and
several
businesses
geared

outdoor
sports
,
and
a

horse
show
.

Geography
Townsend
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

Townsend
is
situated
in
Tuckaleechee
Cove
,
one
of
several
"
limestone
windows
"
that
dot
the
northern
base
of
the
Smokies
.

These
windows
form
when
erosional
forces
carry
away
the
older
rocks
(
mostly
sandstone
)
,
exposing
the
younger
rock
below
(
i.e.
,
limestone
)
.

Limestone
windows
are
normally
flatter
than
other
mountainous
valleys
,
and
are
typically
coated
with
rich
,
fertile
soil
.

Other
limestone
windows
in
the
area
include
Cades
Cove
,
Wear
Cove
,
and
Jones
Cove
.

Tuckaleechee
Cove
is
situated
between
Bates
Mountain
to
the
north
and
Rich
Mountain
to
the
south
,
with
the
cove
's
greater
population
estimated
at
around
0,000
.

Little
River
,
its
source
high
in
the
mountains
on
the
north
slopes
of
Clingmans
Dome
,
slices
east-to-west
through
Tuckaleechee
and
drains
much
of
the
cove
.

History
Native
Americans
were
the
first
inhabitants
of
Tuckaleechee
Cove
,
with
the
oldest
archaeological
finds
in
the
cove
dating
to
0000
B.C.
.

A
number
of
pottery
fragments
and
ax
heads
dating
to
the
Woodland
period
have
also
been
found
.

By
0000
A.D.
,
Tuckaleechee
's
Native
American
inhabitants
had
built
a
fortified
village
near
the
cove
's
northern
entrance
.

The
Cherokee
arrived
in
the
area
around
0000
,
and
built
a
series
of
small
villages
along
Little
River
.

The
name
"
Tuckaleechee
"
is
from
the
Cherokee
"
Tikwalitsi
"
,
and
its
original
meaning
is
unknown
.

A
branch
of
the
Great
Indian
Warpath
forked
in
the
cove
,
with
one
branch
heading
west
to
the
Overhill
towns
along
the
Little
Tennessee
River
and
another
heading
south
to
North
Carolina
.

00th
century
anthropologist
James
Mooney
recounted
an
attempted
raid
on
the
Cherokee
villages
in
Tuckaleechee
by
the
Shawano
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

The
raid
was
thwarted
when
a
Cherokee
conjurer
named
Deadwood
Lighter
envisioned
the
position
of
the
Shawano
ambush
,
and
the
Cherokees
surprised
the
raiders
from
the
rear
,
killing
many
of
them
and
chasing
the
rest
back
over
the
crest
of
the
Smokies
.

By
the
time
the
first
Euro-American
settlers
arrived
in
Tuckaleechee
in
the
late
00th
century
,
the
Cherokee
villages
had
been
abandoned
.

In
0000
,
humorist
George
Washington
Harris
published
an
account
of
a
country
dance
held
that
year
in
Tuckaleechee
(
"
Tuck-a-lucky
"
)
Cove
on
the
farm
of
"
Capt.
Dillon
.
"

Moonshine
,
cornbread
,
eggs
and
ham
were
served
,
and
revelers
danced
to
music
provided
by
a
fiddle-and
-
dulcimer
duo
.

To
win
dance
partners
,
the
men
engaged
in
a
display
of
"
feats
of
strength
,
"
while
the
women
quilted
.

The
logging
industry
In
the
0000s
,
the
lumber
industry
experienced
a
boom
,
due
largely
to
two
key
innovations
—
the
band
saw
and
the
logging
railroad
.

Flatland
forest
resources
in
the
Ohio
Valley
and
along
the
Mississippi
Delta
were
quickly
exhausted
,
and
logging
firms
began
turning
more
and
more
to
the
untapped
resources
of
the
more
mountainous
areas
.

In
0000
,
hoping
to
capitalize
on
the
thick
virgin
forests
of
the
Smokies
,
Colonel
W.B.
Townsend
of
Pennsylvania
purchased
of
land
along
Little
River
,
stretching
from
Tuckaleechee
Cove
all
the
way
to
Clingmans
Dome
.

The
following
year
,
Townsend
received
a
charter
for
his
new
firm
,
the
Little
River
Lumber
Company
.

A
band
saw
mill
was
erected
in
Tuckaleechee
,
and
Townsend
gave
his
name
to
the
community
that
grew
in
the
mill
's
vicinity
.

The
Little
River
Railroad
was
constructed
shortly
thereafter
,
connecting
the
saw
mill
with
Walland
to
the
west
,
and
following
Little
River
all
the
way
to
Elkmont
,
to
the
southeast
.

Townsend
quickly
profited
from
the
forests
of
the
Little
River
bottomlands
.

In
0000
,
he
reported
that
Little
River
Lumber
's
consistently-high
rate
of
planks-per-acre
was
showing
no
sign
of
decline
.

Indeed
,
a
single
giant
chestnut
tree
in
the
Smokies
could
produce
00,000
planks
of
wood
.

Townsend
's
success
led
to
a
rapid
expansion
of
logging
operations
throughout
the
Smokies
.

By
the
time
the
park
was
formed
in
the
0000s
,
nearly
two-thirds
of
area
forests
had
been
cut
down
.

[

The
rapid
destruction
of
the
forests
of
southern
Appalachia
led
to
increased
efforts
by
conservationists
to
slow
or
halt
logging
operations
.

Col.
Townsend
initially
opposed
the
effort
,
but
after
some
wavering
,
sold
at
base
price
of
his
Little
River
Lumber
tract
in
0000
to
what
would
eventually
become
the
Great
Smoky
Mountains
National
Park
.
