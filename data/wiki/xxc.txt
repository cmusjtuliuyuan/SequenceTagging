Oakwood
is
a
city
in
Montgomery
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Oakwood
is
part
of
the
Dayton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

It
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

John
Henry
Patterson
,
industrialist
and
founder
of
the
National
Cash
Register
Corporation
,
is
considered
the
"
Father
of
Oakwood
.
"

Oakwood
is
completely
land-locked
by
the
surrounding
municipalities
of
Dayton
and
Kettering
.

Its
small
,
compact
geographic
area
facilitates
the
response
of
its
single
unified
(
consolidated
)
Department
of
Public
Safety
,
in
which
all
personnel
are
certified
as
police
officer
s
,
firefighter
s
,
and
emergency
medical
services
(
EMS
)
officers
.

Oakwood
is
one
of
only
a
few
U.S.
cities
to
employ
the
concept
.

Public
safety
officers
work
00-hour
shifts
,
performing
the
different
functions
within
eight-hour
blocks
of
each
shift
.

History
At
the
turn
of
the
twentieth
century
,
Oakwood
was
primarily
farmland
situated
on
a
hill
directly
south
of
the
City
of
Dayton
.

In
0000
,
when
a
disastrous
flood
devastated
downtown
Dayton
(
the
Great
Dayton
Flood
)
,
advertising
began
to
tout
Oakwood
property
as
"
000
feet
higher
than
the
intersection
of
Third
and
Main
Streets
.
"

In
light
of
this
real
estate
advantage
and
its
location
adjacent
to
the
City
of
Dayton
,
Oakwood
’s
largest
period
of
growth
began
and
by
0000
,
the
village
population
numbered
over
0,000
.

Oakwood
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
and
in
0000
adopted
the
Council/Manager
form
of
government
that
is
still
in
place
.

One
of
the
city
’s
early
residents
was
Orville
Wright
,
whose
home
,
Hawthorn
Hill
,
still
stands
at
the
corner
of
Harman
and
Park
Avenues
.

John
H.
Patterson
,
founder
of
the
National
Cash
Register
Company
(
NCR
)
also
called
Oakwood
home
.

The
city
is
known
as
a
suburban
residential
area
with
mostly
tree-lined
streets
.

During
World
War
II
,
the
Runnymede
Playhouse
in
Oakwood
hosted
Unit
IV
of
the
Dayton
Project
.

The
Dayton
Project
was
a
little-known
part
of
the
Manhattan
Project
involved
in
creating
industrial
quantities
of
polonium
for
use
in
the
neutron
generating
triggers
of
the
first
atomic
weapon
.

Geography
It
is
within
the
Miami
Valley
region
of
southwestern
Ohio
,
and
borders
on
Dayton
,
Ohio
to
its
North
and
East
and
Kettering
,
Ohio
to
its
South
and
West
.

The
campus
of
the
University
of
Dayton
is
directly
adjacent
to
Oakwood
on
the
northeast
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

The
city
is
unofficially
divided
into
two
parts
,
east
and
west
,
by
the
city
's
major
road
,
State
Route
00
,
also
termed
Far
Hills
Avenue
.

SR
00
runs
north-south
and
connects
the
city
of
Dayton
with
Oakwood
and
,
further
south
,
with
Kettering
and
other
suburbs
.

The
geography
of
the
eastern
and
western
sections
differs
to
a
significant
extent
,
with
the
western
side
covered
in
prominent
hills
,
while
most
of
the
eastern
section
is
predominantly
level
or
gently
sloping
.

Housing
and
aesthetics
Oakwood
contains
a
rich
collection
of
architecture
.

Because
of
the
city
's
age
,
many
of
the
houses
were
constructed
before
World
War
II
and
are
older
in
design
.

Houses
in
Oakwood
,
which
vary
greatly
in
size
,
have
styles
which
include
Tudor
,
Swiss
chalets
,
Colonial
Revival
,
White
Clapboard
Colonial
,
and
Gothic
Revival
.

The
western
end
of
the
city
features
many
large
properties
and
historic
houses
,
such
as
Hawthorn
Hill
,
home
of
Orville
Wright
.

The
houses
in
this
area
tend
to
lie
on
well
secluded
plots
of
land
,
surrounded
by
many
trees
.

Because
of
Oakwood
's
affluence
,
there
is
a
general
societal
push
for
beautification
.

Rundown
houses
and
unkempt
lawns
are
generally
frowned
upon
by
the
community
and
result
in
neatly
cut
lawns
and
gardens
.

The
city
itself
gives
"
Beautification
Awards
"
to
the
judged
most
beautiful
houses
in
order
to
maintain
this
high
level
of
aesthetic
awareness
.

The
city
has
relatively
strict
zoning
laws
that
restrict
major
changes
to
houses
and
require
city
approval
for
any
planned
structural
additions
.

The
city
prohibits
chain-link
fences
that
can
be
seen
from
the
street
,
and
requires
all
external
utility
units
(
such
as
air
conditioning
units
)
to
be
obstructed
from
the
view
from
the
street
.

Public
architecture
is
a
general
source
of
pride
for
the
Oakwood
community
.

The
city
buildings
were
designed
to
incorporate
the
rich
variation
of
traditional
architectural
styles
found
in
the
city
's
houses
.

Oakwood
High
School
displays
an
elaborate
external
design
.

The
elementary
schools
,
Edwin
D.
Smith
Elementary
School
and
Harman
Elementary
School
,
echo
this
elaborate
style
.

Smith
Elementary
is
built
in
the
Tudor
style
like
the
High
School
while
Harman
Elementary
is
Colonial
revival
.

The
newest
addition
to
the
school
system
,
the
Julian
and
Marjorie
Lange
School
,
features
Spanish
revival
architecture
.

The
Oakwood
Board
of
Education
occupies
a
gray
stucco
manse
with
red
tile
roof
in
the
northern
most
area
of
Oakwood
on
Rubicon
Road
.

Wright
Memorial
Library
offers
similar
aesthetics
,
and
the
police
and
fire
department
is
reminiscent
of
a
French
chateau
.

Schools
Oakwood
schools
are
repeatedly
ranked
among
the
very
best
in
Ohio
and
the
top-tier
in
the
nation
.

NeighborhoodScout.com
chose
Oakwood
as
number
0
in

for
the
entire
Midwest
.

The
school
district
's
mascot
is
the
Lumberjack
so
as
to
pay
homage
to
the
wooded
areas
which
gave
Oakwood
its
name
.

The
Lange
School
is
the
city
's
kindergarten
building
.

Until
The
Lange
School
opened
in
0000
,
kindergartens
were
in
each
elementary
school
.

The
Harman
Elementary
School
and
Edwin
D.
Smith
Elementary
School
provide
service
to
children
from
first
through
sixth
grades
.

One
contiguous
junior
and
senior
high
school
provides
education
for
all
Oakwood
students
grades
seven
through
twelve
.

Oakwood
High
School
graduated
its
first
senior
class
in
0000
and
began
the
practice
of
the
Baccalaureate
ceremony
at
Westminster
Presbyterian
Church
in
downtown
Dayton
.

The
end
of
an
Oakwood
student
's
experience
is
the
Senior
Awards
,
Baccalaureate
,
and
Commencement
ceremonies
.

The
top
senior
awards
are
the
Daisy
Talbott
Greene
and
Harry
E.
Talbott
awards
which
are
narrowed
down
throughout
the
school
year
to
the
best
all-around
senior
female
and
male
as
voted
by
the
high
school
faculty
.

These
students
exemplify
"
scholarship
,
athletics
,
and
leadership
"
under
the
definition
of
the
award
.

Oakwood
High
School
's
yearbook
is
The
Acorn
,
and
its
newspaper
is
The
Dome
.

Oakwood
's
educational
system
places
a
strong
emphasis
on
post-secondary
education
.

Oakwood
High
School
is
a
national
school
of
excellence
.

Oakwood
High
School
's
English
,
mathematics
,
natural
science
,
and
foreign
language
courses
are
matched
by
many
performing
arts
opportunities
for
its
students
.

It
is
not
uncommon
for
Oakwood
's
top
academic
graduates
to
gain
acceptance
to
some
of
the
most
selective
universities
and
colleges
in
the
United
States
and
the
world
.

Most
graduates
,
however
,
attend
schools
within
a
000
mile
radius
,
with
a
large
percentage
remaining
in
Ohio
.

Oakwood
High
School
is
consistently
ranked
as
one
of
the
top
00
academic
institutes
in
Ohio
as
well
as
one
of
the
top
000
in
the
United
States
.

Much
of
the
community
's
unity
centers
around
the
city
schools
.

Sporting
events
,
plays
and
musicals
are
generally
well
attended
by
the
city
's
adults
.

The
quality
of
the
Oakwood
School
District
attracts
many
families
and
in
turn
keeps
real
estate
values
high
in
spite
of
the
aging
housing
base
.

Oakwood
voters
generally
support
property
tax
raises
in
order
to
keep
the
schools
well
maintained
which
in
turn
help
to
keep
property
values
high
.

History
On
August
00
,
0000
,
Benjamin
Wilhelm
,
a
settler
from
Pennsylvania
,
settled
near
the
intersection
of
U.S.
Route
00
and
US
Route
00-A
.

He
built
his
home
and
a
small
general
store
as
a
stop
and
resting
place
for
travelers
heading
west
.

The
small
town
began
to
attract
travelers
and
entrepreneurs
,
and
on
February
0
,
0000
the
town
was
incorporated
as
"
The
Village
of
Vandalia
"
with
Benjamin
Wilhelm
as
its
first
mayor
.

The
village
was
laid
out
in
00
lots
including
a
church
,
hotels
,
blacksmiths
shops
,
a
steam
sawmill
,
meat
markets
,
and
a
carriage
shop
.

The
first
church
was
started
by
the
United
Brethren
congregation
.

By
0000
,
Vandalia
was
outgrowing
its
"
village
"
status
,
and
its
citizens
voted
to
make
it
a
council-manager
form
of
government
,
effectively
making
the
village
into
a
municipal
corporation
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
Vandalia
became
a
Charter
City
of
the
State
of
Ohio
.

Name
Some
records
indicate
that
Benjamin
Wilhelm
,
the
town
's
founder
,
settled
in
Vandalia
on
his
way
to
Vandalia
,
Illinois
.

Instead
he
stopped
here
and
named
his
new
town
after
his
original
destination
.

Others
claim
that
the
town
was
named
Vandalia
because
the
National
Road
was
intended
to
extend
to
Vandalia
,
Illinois
,
but
,
for
a
time
,
it
looked
as
though
it
would
not
do
so
.

As
a
result
the
name
was
used
for
a
town
along
the
Road
in
Ohio
.

Architecture
Vandalia
has
two
specific
types
of
architecture
that
are
heavily
present
throughout
the
city
:
colonial
and
post-modern
.

Many
of
the
city
buildings
have
post-modern
design
and
are
mainly
glass
and
brick
.

Butler
High
School
has
been
re-constructed
in
this
style
,
and
New
Morton
Middle
School
,
the
Justice
and
Municipal
Buildings
,
the
Recreation
Center
,
and
a
new
fire
station
have
already
been
constructed
in
this
manner
.

Clashing
with
this
in
a
unique
way
that
many
find
aesthetically
pleasing
is
Vandalia
's
colonial
architecture
.

Many
of
the
older
buildings
and
some
of
the
newer
multi-story
buildings
along
James
E.
Bohanan
Memorial
Drive
have
a
very
high
end
,
colonial
look
.

Other
townhouses
and
condos
throughout
this
area
have
used
this
architecture
frequently
,
and
many
developments
around
Miller
Lane
have
colonial
styles
.

Some
homes
throughout
different
neighborhoods
like
Meeker
Creek
,
Ashbury
Farms
,
Park
Place
,
and
Copperfield
have
many
colonial
style
homes
.

recently
passed
plans
to
reinvent
the
city
's
urban
core
around

The
plan
is
to
bring
many
of
the
old
shopping
centers
to
the
streetfront
while
placing
parking
spaces
in
the
back
.

The
first
business
to
take

in
this
plan
is

stoplights
,
and
brick
pavers

Airport
conflictions
The
city
of
Dayton
had
proposed
an
extension
to
the
Dayton
International
Airport
in
0000
that
would
annex
part
of
Butler
Township
.

The
idea
caused
a
mass
conflict
as
it
would
disturb
the
natural
shape
of
the
city
of
Vandalia
and
it
would
heavily
disturb
the
shape
of
National
Road
,
or
Rt.
00
.

The
proposals
where
cancelled
,
however
in
0000
when
the
city
of
Vandalia
purchased
the
same
land
that
was
partially
owned
by
University
of
Dayton
,
the
city
of
Dayton
finally
began
to
work
on
their
redeveloped
expansion
of
the
airport
which
included
a
new
sight
tower
and
updating
of
landscaping
and
the
Airport
Access
Road
.

The
same
land
will
soon
see
increased
development
with
the
opening
of
MAC
,
Morton
Middle
School
,
Vandalia-Butler
Fire
Station
#
0
,
and
is
zoned
for
increased
high
end
/
tech
office
jobs
.

The
land
is
also
heavily
developed
as
an
office
park
and
a
mix
of
retail
and
restaurants
.

The
city
of
Vandalia
is
hoping
that
,
with
regional
cooperation
,
the
city
of
Dayton
will
work
well
to
promote
more
office
and
upscale
development
in
the
region
.

site
of
a
Shawnee
(

)
village
known
as
Wakatomika
,
which
gave
its
name
to
Wakatomika
Creek
,
the
creek
that
empties
into
the
Muskingum
River
near
the
northern
edge
of
the
village
.

These
were
the
easternmost
of
the
Shawnee
villages
,
and
the
home
of
the
most
hostile
of
that
tribe
.

David

,
the
Moravian
missionary
,
preached
there
in

an
effort
to
convert

the
wrongs

discussed
at

place
with
much
rancor

was
formed
,
with
Rev.

Wallace
published
a
single
edition

until
Wallace
and
Agnew
produced
the
Advocate
in
0000
,
which
had
a
run

office
was
opened
.

The

closed
several
years
before

opened
its
office
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
together
with
several
other
prominent
citizens
,
George
Willison
Adams
formed
a
stock
company
to
build
the
third
suspension
bridge
in
the
United
States
across
the
Muskingum
river
near
Dresden
.

When
the
other
members
of
the
company
became
fearful
that
the
plan
was
not
feasible
and
that
they
would
lose
their
money
,
Adams
built
the
bridge
at
his
own
expense
,
his
nephew
,
George
Copeland
,
was
the
bridge
's
engineer
.

It
was
0000
feet
in
length
,
cost
$
00,000.00
and
was
made
from
materials
manufactured
in
Dresden
.

The
bridge
was
run
as
a
toll
bridge
for
several
years
before
Adams
eventually
sold
the
bridge
to
the
county
commissioners
for
one-third
of
the
original
building
cost
of
the
bridge
.

The
bridge
was
eventually
destroyed
in
the
Great
Flood
of
0000
.

0000
also
saw
a
small
congregation
of
00
people
organized
for
the
German
Methodist
Episcopal
church
.

Services
were
held
,
first
in
the
Market
house
and
,
later
,
in
0000
,
a
frame
church
was
built
.

Also
in
0000
,
L.
J.
Lemert
opened
the
first
bank
in
Dresden
.

In
0000
Bently
took
over
ownership
of
The
Intelligencer
who
,
in
turn
sold
the
paper
to
M.
B.
Lovett
who
suspended
publication
around
0000
.

In
0000
G.
Eaton
established
the
second
bank
in
Dresden
.

Meanwhile
,
in
0000
,
T.
W.
Peacock
and
son
started
a
second
newspaper
in
the
town
called
the
Dresden
Monitor
,
which
they
sold
to
J.
A.
Jackson
a
year
later
.

Ownership
of
the
Dresden
Monitor
then
passed
through
the
hands
of
L.
M.
Murphy
,
W.
H.
Conklin
and
J.
T.
Shryock
successively
.

Shryock
ran
the
paper
successfully
for
two
years
before
selling
the
paper
to
John
W.
Martin
,
who
changed
its
name
to
Herald
and
continued
publishing
it
for
another
six
months
.

In
0000
James
W.
Wheeling
established
a
newspaper
called
Dresden
Doings
which
he
published
bi-weekly
.

In
September
0000
Wheeling
sold
his
paper
to
W.
E.
Smith
.

Smith
began
publishing
the
paper
weekly
and
continued
publishing
the
Doings
until
0000
when
it
became
The
Dresden
Transcript
.

The
Transcript
is
still
being
published
weekly
as

the
village
.

River
traffic
to
the
mouth
of
the
Portage
River
,
and
beyond
,
moved
the
products
to
national
and
world
ports
.

With
the
growth
of
the
village
,
it
became
necessary
to
establish
a
post
office
.

Because
there
were
three
other
Hartfords
in
Ohio
,
the
Post
Office
Department
requested
a
name
change
.

After
much
discussion
,
heated
debate
and
research
in
the
Post
Office
Directory
,
the
name
of
Oak
Harbor
was
chosen
.
"

Oak
"
to
emphasize
the
prominence
of
that
wood
in
the
surrounding
area
,
and
"
Harbor
"
,
the
importance
of
the
river
to
the
Village
.

Thus
in
January
0000
,
the
Hartford
Post
Office
ceased
to
exist
and
the
Post
Office
named
Oak
Harbor
came
into
being
.

The
name
of
the
Village
itself
was
changed
from
Hartford
to
Oak
Harbor
on
March
00
,
0000
.

Oak
Harbor
was
incorporated
April
00
,
0000
.

Up
until
the
0000s
,
the
Portage
River
was
the
only
way
for
local
businesses
to
ship
their
products
.

The
first
boat
on
the
river
was
the
"
John
Marshall
"
,
run
by
Adolphus
Kraemer
.

The
scow
"
Mary
Berkhead
"
,
was
,
in
pre-Civil
War
times
,
the
fourth
largest
on
the
Great
Lakes
.

It
shipped
white
oak
staves
from
the
Charles
Roose
Stave
Factory
to
Buffalo
,
New
York
.

Poplar
plank
were
also
sent
to
Buffalo
sometime
later
during
the
Civil
War
.

Oak
went
by
the
Welland
Canal
to
Scotland
to
be
used
for
ship
building
.

Thousands
of
cords
of
wood
were
sent
to
Cleveland
,
Sandusky
and
the
Lake
Erie
Islands
to
be
used
for
fuel
for
the
Buffalo/Detroit
steamships
.

A
great
number
of
the
products
from
Oak
Harbor
manufacturing
went
down
the
Portage
River
and
on
to
world
ports
.

Festivals
Oak
Harbor
is
home
to
the
annual
Apple
Festival
which
occurs
in
early
October
.

Many
apple
related
events
are
always
scheduled
including
the
"
Apple
Run
"
which
is
a
0
kilometer
race
on
the
Sunday
of
the
festival

Antwerp
is
a
village
in
Paulding
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
along
the
Maumee
River
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Antwerp
is
the
nearest
village
to
the
Six
Mile
Reservoir
,
the
site
of
the
Reservoir
War
in
0000
.

Antwerp
is
the
birthplace
of
Asa
Long
,
the
English
draughts
player
.

The
place
is
named
after
the
Belgian
city
of
Antwerp
.

History
Antwerp
is
located
in
the
former
wetland
region
known
until
the
00th
century
as
the
Great
Black
Swamp
.

The
area
was
avoided
by
the
early
settlers
due
to
its
thick
forestation
and
extensive
swamps
and
marshes
.

After
the
area
had
been
drained
,
small
industries
developed
here
,
and
the
construction
of
the
canals
along
the
Maumee
River
in
the
0000s
and
the
land
reclamation
project
that
followed
helped
convert
the
former
swamplands
into
fertile
farmlands
,
leading
to
the
growth
of
a
farming
community
in
Antwerp
.

In
the
late
00th
century
,
Antwerp
was
the
largest
village
in
Paulding
County
;
its
economy
was
driven
by
a
lucrative
local
logging
industry
.

Accordingly
,
when
the
Wabash
,
St.
Louis
and
Pacific
Railway
decided
to
erect
a
train
station
in
the
village
,
it
was
built
larger
than
stations
in
most
other
communities
in
the
region
.

After
the
train
station
closed
in
0000
,
it
was
purchased
by
the
local
historical
society
;
today
,
it
is
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
as
the
"
Antwerp
Norfolk
and
Western
Depot
"

Industry
Paulding
is
largely
a
bedroom
community
.

At
one
point
,
Paulding
had
a
factory
processing
sugar
from
beets
,
and
another
processing
ketchup
from
tomatoes
,
but
both
factories
have
ceased
production
and
neighboring
farms
no
longer
produce
those
crops
.

At
one
point
,
Paulding
boasted
of
three
local
elevators
-
Equity
Exchange
,
Paulding
Grain
and
Seed
,
and
the
Farm
Bureau
-
but
the
loss
of
rail
service
,
most
grain
is
trucked
elsewhere
.

Paulding
was
once
home
to
Betty
Zane
popcorn
,
but
that
disappeared
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Many
manufacturing
facilities
have
come
and
gone
,
producing
such
products
as
glass
mailboxes
,
ink
wells
,
and
brake
linings
.

A
number
of
small
factories
exist
,
but
the
largest
single
employer
in
the
Village
is
the
government
,
with
Paulding
Exempted
Village
Schools
being
the
largest
organization
.

Many
residents
commute
to
industrial
jobs
,
often
in
neighboring
counties
.

Education
Paulding
High
School
sports
participate
in
the
Northwest
Conference
,
an
athletic
body
sanctioned
by
the
Ohio
High
School
Athletic
Association
(
OHSAA
)
.

The
school
on
Water
Street
is
one
of
the
largest
schools
in
the
state
providing
elementary
education
.

In
many
districts
,
elementary
schools
are
kept
small
so
students
can
walk
to
school
.

The
graduating
class
of
0000
included
the
last
Paulding
students
who
experienced
a
one-room
schoolhouse
,
as
they
had
attended
the
first
grade
at
Emerald
.

That
was
a
fairly
pleasant
transition
,
unlike
0000
,
when
many
county
residents
were
outraged
to
learn
Dr.
Martin
Essex
of
the
Ohio
State
Board
of
Education
had
revoked
the
charters
of
0
of
the
0
Paulding
County
schools
,
asserting
that
they
were
too
small
to
offer
a
good
education
.

Auglaize-Brown
asked
to
join
the
Paulding
Exempted
Village
School
district
,
while
the
Grover

merged

History
The

of
Somerset
was
established
in
0000
by
settlers
from
Somerset
,
Pennsylvania
at
the
spot
on
Zane
's
Trace
located
midway
between
Lancaster
and
Zanesville
.

Seven
years
later
,
parts
of
Fairfield
,
Muskingum
,
and
Washington
counties
were
merged
to
create
Perry
County
,
and
the
house
of
a
Somerset
resident
was
named
the
first
temporary
courthouse
.

In
0000
,
the
county
government
arrange
for
the
erection
of
a
purpose-built
courthouse
in
Somerset
;
while
most
of
the
building
was
used
for
a
jail
,
it
also
included
a
courtroom
and
space
for
some
county
offices
.

Ten
years
later
,
a
permanent
courthouse
was
constructed
on
the
village
's
public
square
.

As
the
village
of
New
Lexington
grew
in
importance
,
its
residents
began
to
agitate
for
the
county
seat
to
be
moved
to
their
community
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
the
state
legislature
passed
three
separate
laws
to
permit
the
county
seat
to
be
moved
;
contentious
elections
and
a
decision
by
the
Supreme
Court
of
Ohio
saw
the
county
seat
move
to
New
Lexington
,
back
to
Somerset
,
and
finally
back
to
New
Lexington
.

After
it
ceased
to
be
used
as
a
courthouse
,
the
building
was
leased
to
Somerset
for
use
as
its
village
hall
.

History
In
0000
two
distilleries
were
built
near
Ashville
and
were
owned
by
William
and
Richard
Staige
(
Stage
)
.

The
land
that
is
now
Ashville
was
at
that
time
primarily
the
property
of
Richard
Staige
.

After
many
years
he
sold
his
distillery
to
Mahlon
Ashbrook
,
who
did
a
large
business
with
his
brother
Absolom
.

He
also
built
a
grist
mill
on
Walnut
Creek
about
0000
and
owned
a
large
store
that
was
run
by
his
sister
Idy
and
her
husband
Daniel
Kellerman
.

Kellerman
was
the
first
postmaster
in
Ashbrook
(
later
Ashville
)
.

The
Ashbrook
's
enterprises
failed
in
0000
.

From
that
time
,
until
the
construction
of
the
Scioto
Valley
Railroad
through
Ashville
and
the
advent
of
a
depot
in
0000
,
business
was
slow
.

Ashville
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
with
the
first
mayor
being
W.
R.
Julian
.

A
historical
museum
,
Ohio
's
Small
Town
Museum

The
museum
,
established
in

,
claims
to
be
home
to
America
's
oldest
working
traffic
light
,
which
directed
traffic
in
downtown
Ashville
until
the
0000s
.

This
signal
was
designed
by
local
resident
Teddy
Boor
.

Ashville
is
featured
in
the

Concepts
video
production
"

The
video
depicts
a
surprising
number
of
achievements
and
innovations
,
as
well
as
connections
to
American
and
world
history
.

The
Puppeteers
of
America
organization
was
first
incorporated
in
Ashville
in

Circleville
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Pickaway
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
along
the
Scioto
River
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
Delaware
Indians
were
pushed
west
from
Pennsylvania
by
the
coming
of
the
English-led
settlers
to
that
state
.

They
were
given
permission
by
the
Wyandot
to
settle
in
the
Ohio
country
,
and
one
of
their
settlements
was
Maguck
,
built
by
0000
in
the
area
of
modern
Circleville
.

Noted
frontier
explorer
Christopher
Gist
was
the
first
recorded
European
visitor
to
the
Circleville
area
.

Gist
reached
"
Maguck
,
"
a
small
town
of
about
00
families
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Scioto
River
and
the
south
side
of
Circleville
,
on
January
00
,
0000
,
and
remained
in
the
town
until
January
00
.

Circleville
was
founded
in
0000
.

It
derived
its
name
from
the
circular
portion
of
a
large
Hopewell
culture
earthwork
upon
which
it
was
built
.

The
original
town
plan
integrated
Circleville
into
the
preexisting
land
with
a
street
layout
of
concentric
circles
.

An
octagonal
courthouse
stood
directly
in
the
center
.

Dissatisfaction
rose
with
Circleville
's
layout
,
however
,
and
in
0000
,
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
authorized
the
"
Circleville
Squaring
Company
"
to
convert
it
into
a
square
.

By
0000
,
this
had
been
completed
in
several
phases
.

No
remaining
traces
of
the
original
earthworks
remain
,
though
a
few
old
buildings
retain
curved
walls
that
were
part
of
the
original
circular
layout
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
an
F-0
tornado
hit
the
city
.

A
squall
line
moving
through
the
region
spawned
several
tornadoes
in
the
county
,
including
the
F-0
that
hit
town
.

The
tornado
touched
down
on
the
north
side
of
town
doing
substantial
damage
to
a
barber
shop
and
a
masonry
building
.

A
furniture
store
was
also
damaged
with
a
hole
in
its
roof
where
it
was
reported
that
items
from
inside
the
store
were
sucked
out
.

Damage
to
nearby
buildings
also
occurred
as
the
tornado
moved
east
across
the
north-central
part
of
town
.

The
tornado
then
moved
into
a
residential
area
in
the
Northwood
Park
neighborhood
where
several
homes
along
Fairlawn
Drive
were
destroyed
.

Heavy
damage
to
trees
and
vehicles
also
occurred
in
this
area
.

The
tornado
would
lift
as
it
crossed
Edgewood
Drive
,
but
snapped
the
tops
of
some
nearby
trees
as
it
lifted
and
moved
on
.

the
only
Brimfield
Township
statewide
.

It
was
known

History
Colonel
John
Garrett
III
purchased
000
acre
s
(
0
000
000
m
²
)
of
land
in
Nelson
Township
,
Portage
County
,
Ohio
in
0000
,
the
year
Ohio
became
a
state
.

The
land
was
purchased
for
the
price
of
$
0,000
,
or
about
$
0.00
per
acre
.

In
July
of
the
following
year
,
he
settled
on
this
land
with
his
family
and
two
friends
.

These
settlers
constructed
a
grist
mill
,
which
was
to
open
in
January
0000
.

In
this
month
,
however
,
Garrett
died
.

In
0000
,
the
Cleveland
-
Pittsburgh
Road
was
constructed
near
Garrett
's
mill
.

This
improved
commerce
to
the
area
,
and
nearby
pioneers
would
mill
their
grain
at
the
mill
,
eventually
building
roads
and
trails
to
meet
with
the
Cleveland-Pittsburgh
Road
.

By
0000
,
residents
in
the
area
around
the
mill
had
built
up
a
settlement
which
they
hoped
to
incorporate
.

This
was
done
,
and
on
September

History
Long
before
settlers
moved
into
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
,
Seneca
Indians
traversed
the
area
now
called
Streetsboro
.

They
used
Old
Portage
Trail
,
which
crosses
the
southwest
corner
of
the
city
,
to
go
from
Lake
Erie
to
the
Ohio
River
basin
.

The
founder
of
Streetsboro
Township
was
Titus
Street
from
Connecticut
,
who
purchased
the
land
in
0000
.

The
land
was
surveyed
by
Streets
'
agents
Ralph
Cowles
and
Lemuel
Punderson
in
the
summer
of
0000
and
divided
into
lots
of
.

In
0000
,
a
turnpike
from
Cleveland
to
Wellsville
,
Ohio
was
laid
by
Frederick
Wadsworth
,
Samuel
Cowles
,
John
Strauyhen
and
Titus
Street
.

Street
agreed
to
give
enough
land
to
make
it
through
the
township
.

In
0000
,
the
turnpike
was
completed
.

It
followed
much
of
the
route
of
the
present
Ohio
State
Route
00
.

Major
growth
occurred
in
Streetsboro
with
the
opening
of
the
Ohio
Turnpike
on
October

,
with
Exit
00
(
now
known
as
Exit
000
)
initially
being
the
only
interchange
in
Portage
County
.

By
0000
,
with
the
growth
of
the
automobile
industry
,
Streetsboro
experienced
a
population
explosion
.

Proximity
to
the
Akron
and
Cleveland
areas
,
along

(
Ohio
Turnpike
)
,
Interstate
000
and
State
Routes
000
,

greatly
contributed
to
the
rapid
growth
of
manufacturing
,
distribution
,
commercial
and
residential
development
in
the
past
fifty
years
.

In

Shady
Lake
Park
,
located
on
Route

,
which

the
steady
growth
of

area
within

History
During
the
Depression
,
the
Davey
Tree
Company
operated
a
nursery
and
experimental
tree
farm
on
the
site
of
what
is
now
called
the
Village
of
Sugar
Bush
Knolls
.

The
village
was
named
for
the
sugar
maple
trees
which
originally
stood
near
Lake
Martin
.

The
Davey
Company
owned
the
land
where
the
village
is
now
located
and
kept
horses
in
the
barn
on
Ferguson
Road
where
the
Framptons
would
later
live
.

The
company
owned
the
small
white
house
on
the
corner
of
Ferguson
and
Lake
Martin
Drive
.

During
the
early
thirties
,
the
company
offered
to
let
Charles
Miller
,
one
of
its
employees
,
and
his
family
move
into
that
house
,
which
had
no
electricity
,
telephone
,
or
well
.

In
0000
the
Millers
'
son
,
"
Tuck
"
,
and
family
moved
in
with
the
senior
Millers
;
at
this
time
,
the
street
was
just
a
gravel
road
and
did
not
extend
out
to
Route
00
.

Martin
Davey
,
the
president
of
Davey
Tree
,
arranged
to
have
Lake
Martin
(
named
for
him
)
,
Lake
Roger
and
Lake
Quincy
(
for
which
Lake
Quincy
Media
is
named
)
dug
out
of
the
swampland
.

Lake
Roger
was
named
for
William
Roger
Williams
and
Lake
Quincy
for
David
Quincy
Grove
,
both
officers
of
the
Davey
Tree
Company
.

Harold
Moore
was
the
caretaker
of
the
area
used
by
Davey
employees
for
recreation
.

A
picnic
shelter
,
rowboats
,
tree
swings
,
and
picnic
tables
were
used
for
the
company
's
picnics
.

The
death
of
Martin
Davey
in
0000
ended
plans
for
building
the
company
headquarters
on
the
site
.

In
the
0000s
the
land
was
divided
into
building
lots
and
sold
.

Local
businessman
Cyril
Porthouse
purchased
a
number
of
lots
and
built
one
of
the
first
homes
.

He
loaned
the
Village
money
to
have
sewers
installed
so
that
the
village
could
be
developed
.

Some
of
the
early
homes
were
built
by
McElhones
,
Bushes
,
Longs
,
Kaisers
,
and
Geldhofs
.

Windham
is
a
village
located
in
Portage
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

It
is
formed
from
portions
of
Windham
Township
,
one
of
the
original
townships
of
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

In
0000
,
the
US
government
chose
Windham
as
the
site
of
an
army
camp
for
workers
at
the
newly-built
Ravenna
Arsenal
.

As
a
result
,
Windham
experienced
the
largest
increase
in
population
of
any
municipality
in
the
United
States
between
the
0000
and
0000
censuses
:
The
population
increased
from
000
residents
to
0,000
.

Windham
is
part
of
the
Akron
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Owing
to
its
location
,
which
is
slightly
closer
to
Youngstown
than
Akron
and
significantly
closer
to
Warren
(
at
away
,
even
closer
to
Windham
than
the
county
seat
of
Ravenna
)
,
the
village
also
positions
itself
in
relation
to
cities
in
the
Youngstown-Warren-Boardman
,
OH-PA
Metropolitan
Area
.

Accordingly
,
the
sole
bank
in
Windham
holds
membership
in
the
Youngstown-Warren
Regional
Chamber
of
Commerce
.

History
Prior
to
0000
,
the
land
now
comprising
the
Village
and
Township
of
Windham
was
owned
by
Caleb
Strong
,
as
part
of
his
holdings
through
the
Ohio
Company
of
Associates
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
a
group
of
sixteen
men
met
in
Becket
,
Massachusetts
at
the
home
of
Thatcher
Conant
to
discuss
the
purchase
of
land
in
Ohio
for
settlement
.

These
men
,
who
would
be
known
as
the
Beckett
Land
Company
,
consisted
of
Conant
,
Elijah
Alford
,
Nathan
Birchard
,
Gideon
Bush
,
Dillingham
Clark
,
Elisha
Clark
,
Isaac
Clark
,
Benjamin
Higley
,
Aaron
P.
Jagger
,
Enos
Kingsley
,
Jeremiah
Lyman
,
Bill
Messenger
,
Ebenezer
Messenger
,
Benjamin
C.
Perkins
,
John
Seely
,
and
Alpheus
Streator
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
the
Beckett
Land
Company
purchased
about
from
Caleb
Strong
.

The
land
was
divided
into
000
lot
s
,
and
allotted
according
to
each
family
's
investment
in
the
company
.

Conant
,
his
wife
Elizabeth
,
Dillingham
and
Abigail
Clark
,
and
Alpheus
and
Anna
Streator
donated
portions
of
their
allotments
near
the
center
of
the
township
for
a
village
green
,
which
was
common
practice
for
townships
in
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
.

The
group
of
sixteen
families
then
departed
from
Massachusetts
on
May
0
,
0000
.

Six
weeks
later
,
they
arrived
in
the
purchased
survey
township
,
which
was
located
immediately
south
of
Nelson
Township
in
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
.

This
new
township
,
known
today
as
Windham
Township
,
was
survey
town
0
in
range
0
of
the
Western
Reserve
.

The
first
religious
service
in
the
new
township
was
held
on
July
00
,
0000
,
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
settlers
.

This
service
was
very
likely
Congregationalist
,
as
several
of
the
families
belonged
to
the
Congregational
Church
in
Becket
,
Massachusetts
.

The
Congregational
Church
eventually
constructed
a
building
on
the
Green
,
and
today
that
church
still
remains
on
the
Green
as
a
member
church
of
the
United
Church
of
Christ
.

The
Windham
Historical
Society
notes
that
the
township
was
originally
named
Strongsburg
,
however
,
some
sources
cite
the
original
name
as
Strongsburgh
.

The
namesake
was
original
landowner
Caleb
Strong
,
who
was
by
then
the
Governor
of
Massachusetts
.

There
is
some
discrepancy
in
how
this
township
came
to
be
known
as
Windham
.

According
to
the
Windham
Historical
Society
,
the
name
of
the
township
"
was
changed
to
Sharon
,
by
an
act
of
legislature
in
about
0000
…
.

A
few
years
later
the
name
was
again
changed
to
Windham
,
which
it
has
remained
to
present
.
"

The
Historical
Society
also
cites
political
concerns
as
the
reason
the
name
was
changed
from
Strongsburg
to
Sharon
.

However
,
on
Windham
Township
's
website
,
March
0
,
0000
is
cited
as
the
date
on
which
"
the
Township
was
made
a
district
by
itself
and
the
name
was
changed
to
'
Sharon
'
.
"

The
website
goes
on
to
state
that
in
0000
,
by
an
act
of
legislature
,
the
name
was
changed
again
to
Windham
.

Yet
another
source
,
The
Ohio
Gazetteer
,
and
Travelers
's
Guide
,
states
that
the
name
was
changed
from
Sharon
to
Windham
in
January
,
0000
.

Still
another
source
places
these
dates
as
0000
and
0000
,
respectively
.

Common
to
most
sources
are
a
few
claims
which
reasonably
can
be
ascertained
to
be
fact
:
A
private
academy
was
chartered
in
Windham
on
February
00
,
0000
.

Windham
Academy
was
the
00th
to
be
chartered
by
Ohio
.

This
school
closed
in
0000
,
and
was
replaced
by
a
second
,
short-lived
private
school
in
the
0000s
.

Windham
High
School
was
founded
in
0000
,
across
the
street
from
the
present
school
building
.

The
Village
of
Windham
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
and
on
October
00
,
0000
the
village
officially
withdrew
from
Windham
Township
.

Ravenna
Arsenal
In
0000
,
the
United
States
Department
of
the
Army
reserved
in
eastern
Portage
County
for
the
construction
of
two
facilities
One
of
these
was
the
Portage
Ordnance
Depot
,
which
with
its
twin
facility
the
Ravenna
Ordnance
Plant
became
known
as
the
Ravenna
Arsenal
.

Over
00,000
people
were
employed
at
the
Arsenal
during
World
War
II
,
and
the
village
of
Windham
was
chosen
as
the
site
to
house
many
of
these
workers
.

Windham
experienced
a
population
boom
as
a
result
;
its
growth
of
over
0000
%
was
the
largest
of
any
U.S.
municipality
in
the
0000
Census
,
as
was
reported
in
the
June
0000
edition
of
National
Geographic
Magazine

.

Windham
's
location
on
the

however

has
in

caused

Glandorf
is
a
village
in
Putnam
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Glandorf
was
founded
by
Johann
Wilhelm
Horstmann
and
six
other
men
from
Glandorf
,
Germany
in
0000
.

They
embarked
on
the
ship
Columbus
on
September
0
,
0000
in
Amsterdam
,
landed
November
0
,
0000
in
New
York
,
and
purchased
some
land
in
Putnam
County
in
December
.

Members
of
this
group
were
Johann
F.
Kahle
,
Wilhelm
Gülker
,
Christian
Strope
,
F.
Wischmann
,
Friedrich
Bredeick
and
Mathias
and
Friedrich
Bockrath
.

Kahle
bought
land
at
Greensburg
approximately
0
miles
to
the
west
of
Glandorf
and
named
it
Maria
Camp
.

Horstmann
's
land
was
named
Glandorf
.

Their
wives
and
ten
other
families
from
Glandorf
followed
in
0000
.

This
was
just
the
beginning
of
further
emigration
from
Germany
to
Ohio
and
other
states
of
the
USA
.

After
his
death
on
February
00
,
0000
,
Horstmann
left
his
land
to
the
community
.

In
0000
Horstmann
built
a
log
house
to
serve
as
church
,
school
,
and
rectory
.

The
new
parish
was
placed
under
the
patronage
of
St.
John
the
Baptist
.

In
0000
the
log
house
was
replaced
by
a
wooden
church
with
a
steeple
,
a
bell
and
a
pulpit
from
hallowed-out
sycamore
log
.

A
brick
church
followed
between
0000
and
0000
.

In
0000
the
Neo-Gothic
church
St.
John
the
Baptist
was
erected
and
consecrated
on
December
00
.

In
0000
a
fire
started
in
the
sacristy
of
the
church
and
the
sacristy
and
its
contents
were
a
complete
loss
.

The
entire
interior
has
to
be
repainted
.

A
convent
of
the
German
sisters
'
order
of
the
Society
of
the
Precious
Blood
was
founded
in
0000
.

They
cultivated
the
land
which
was
originally
owned
by
Horstmann
and
served
as
teachers
.

The
convent
was
abandoned
in
0000
.

An
0000
act
of
Ohio
Legislature
provided
for
the
organization
of
Putnam
County
and
the
establishment
of
a
county
seat
.

The
Governor
appointed
Wm.
Cochran
,
Henry
Morris
and
Silas
McClish
as
Associate
Judges
to
organize
the
county
.

Provision
was
also
made
for
the
appointment
of
County
Commissioners
,
a
Town
Director
and
a
Surveyor
to
select
000
acres
in
Union
Township
as
a
county
seat
.

The
associate
Judges
appointed
Thomas
Gray
,
Wm.
Priddy
,
and
Samuel
Myers
as
County
Commissioners
,
Abraham
Sarber
as
Town
Director
and
F.
C.
Fitch
as
Surveyor
.

The
Town
Director
,
with
the
Commissioners
and
Surveyor
,
laid
out
and
platted
a
town
as
required
by
the
legislature
and
they
named
the
town
Kalida
,
meaning
"
beautiful
"
,
which
became
the
seat
of
justice
of
Putnam
County
.

This
was
the
first
town
platted
in
Putnam
County
.

A
frame
court
house
was
erected
in
0000
,
but
this
was
replaced
by
a
brick
building
in
0000
.

Kalida
remained
the
county
seat
until
October
0000
.

At
that
time
a
county-wide
vote
selected
Ottawa
as
the
county
seat
.

A
post
office
was
established
very
soon
after
the
organization
of
Kalida
and
according
to
the
best
tradition
the
first
post
road
serving
Kalida
was
The
Defiance
and
Wapakoneta
Road
from
Fort
Recovery
to
Defiance
.

In
0000
Guthrie
&
Sarber
built
a
grist
mill
on
Hog
Creek
at
Kalida
,
the
second
and
at
that
time
the
most
important
water
mill
in
the
county
.

The
Kalida
area
drained
into
the
Ottawa
River
(
Hog
Creek
)
.

The
land
was
originally
covered
with
forests
and
was
part
of
the
Great
Black
Swamp
.

After
the
land
was
cleared
to
develop
agriculture
,
ditches
and
clay
tiles
were
needed
to
aide
in
drainage
of
the
soil
to
make
it
suitable
for
farming
.

Many
small
tile
mills
were
founded
in
the
area
to
provide
the
needed
tile
.

Today
the
landscape
of
Putnam
County
includes
hundreds
of
highly
productive
farms
.

The
first
Newspaper
in
the
county
was
the
Kalida
Venture
edited
by
Francis
Gillette
.

From
the
time
of
the
first
issue
,
February
00
,
0000
,
Putnam
County
has
not
been
without
at
least
one
newspaper
.

The
Kalida
Sentinel
was
established
at
Kalida
in
0000
.

Schools
were
important
in
this
new
community
,
so
on
September
00
,
0000
,
the
trustees
divided
the
township
into
two
small
school
districts
and
proceeded
to
open
free
schools
that
year
.

According

Samuel
built

a
cabin
,
previous

the
marriage
,
we
moved
into
it
,
and
out
of
a
walnut
log
near
by
we
split
,
hewed
and
planned
stuff
and
made
corner
cupboard
,
a
table
,

,
and
all
of

Pandora
is
a
village
in
Putnam
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
located
on
the
Riley
Creek
.

The
village
is
located
at
the
site
of
a
glacier-formed
beach
that
no
longer
exists
,
being
part
of
the
reason
why
there
is
sandy
soil
outside
of
town
.

In
0000
,
Thomas
Gray
became
the
first
settler
of
the
area
.

Pandora
prospered
because
it
was
the
main
stop
for
travelers
,
mostly
rich
travelers
such
as
doctors
and
lawyers
,
between
Findlay
and
Kalida
.

Pandora
was
originally
named
Columbia
and
later
changed
to
Pendleton
in
0000
.

After
finding
out
there
was
another
town
of
the
same
name
,
it
was
renamed
to
Pandora
,
what
it
is
known
as
today
.

Pandora
was
once
possibly
Ohio
's
largest
industrial
area
until
several
fires
burned
down
the
business
district
of
Pandora
numerous
times
.

Now
Pandora
is
known
as
"
The
Garden
Spot
of
Ohio
"
because
the
community
harvests
several
crops
more
than
anywhere
else
in
the
state
.

Early
history
Independence
was
laid
out
on
the
northwest
quarter
of
Section
00
,
January
00
,
0000
,
by
Daniel
Spohn
.

In
the
early
days
of
its
existence
it
was
nicknamed
"
Spohntown
"
and
"
Squeelgut
,
"
but
was
named
Independence
by
Thomas
B.
Andrews
,
rather
in
a
spirit
of
defiance
at
the
attitude
of
Bellville
,
which
was
not
a
friendly
one
to
the
aspiring
village
.

The
name
was
changed
to
Butler
in
the
0000s
.

Andrews
was
its
first
Postmaster
,
and
,
before
the
town
was
laid
out
,
kept
the
office
in
his
house
near
the
site
.

After
the
town
was
laid
out
and
a
warehouse
erected
,
he
moved
the
office
into
the
warehouse
.

The
land
upon
which
the
town
stands
was
entered
on
the
00th
of
May
,
0000
by
William
Simmons
.

The
town
plat
was
surveyed
by
Joseph
Hastings
.

Mr.
Andrews
was
instrumental
in
getting
the
town
established
and
laying
it
out
,
taking
a
lot
for
pay
.

The
first
store
was
started
by
William
Lamley
,
who
kept
groceries
and
whisky
.

It
may
be
remarked
here
that
Independence
is
a
temperance
town
,
and
will
not
allow
(
since
the
Bowersox
affair
mentioned
in
another
chapter
)
any
saloon
to
exist
in
the
place
.

Lamley
's
store
was
a
small
frame
building
,
near
the
rail
road
,
in
the
north
end
of
the
town
.

He
afterward
erected
a
building
,
which
is
now
occupied
by
Downing
as
a
store
,
and
started
a.
hotel
.

Joseph
Geary
kept
this
hotel
.

the
first
in
the
place
.

David
Teeter
erected
a
second
hotel
.

John
Diltz
,
a
carpenter
and
present
Postmaster
,
erected
the
next
dwelling
,
and
shortly
after
,
Daniel
Garber
erected
a
shoe-shop
on
Main
street
.

William
Clapper
erected
the
next
building
and
kept
boarders
.

Gen.
G.
A.
Jones
came
up
from
Mount
Vernon
,
erected
a
warehouse
,
started
a
store
and
dealt
in
produce
.

In
0000
,
I.
W.
Pearce
purchased
the
warehouse
of
Jones
,
conducted
the
business
.

and
was
also
railroad
agent
.

This
gentleman
at
present
keeps
the
principal
store
in
the
place
,
and
does
what
banking
business
is
necessary
.

When
the
town
was
laid
out
,
the
schoolhouse
a
frame
was
a
short
distance
south
of
town
.

In
0000
,
the
present
building
was
erected
.

It
is
a
two-story
frame
,
and
occupied
by
two
teachers
and
about
one
hundred
pupils
.

In
0000
,
the
village
was
incorporated
,
the
first
Mayor
being
J.
M.
McLaughlin
;
the
second
and
present
Mayor
,
George
W.
McBee
.

There
are
four
dry-goods
and
grocery
stores
,
one
hardware
,
one
stove
and
tin
,
and
several
smaller
establishments
;
two
churches
,
one
hotel
,
and
a
proper
proportion
of
mechanics
and
professional
men
.

The
population
is
about
four
hundred
.

The
place
stands
in
a
great
land
in
the
Baltimore
&
Ohio
Railroad
.

Lucas
is
a
village
in
Richland
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

History
Quite
a
few
years
before
the
founding
of
Lucas
,
General
Brooks
and
his
army
came
up
the
Rockyfork
river
with
supplies
for
troops
at
Fort
Meigs
in
0000
located
in
Perrysburg
Ohio
.

They
took
a
one
day
rest
where
the
Village
of
Lucas
now
stands
.

This
trip
was
no
small
task
.

Brooks
was
commanding
more
than
one
hundred
wagons
drawn
by
six
hundred
horses
.

Lucas
was
born
in
0000
by
a
man
named
John
Tucker
.

He
laid
out
the
land
,
but
his
brother
,
David
Tucker
,
was
the
owner
of
the
land
that
Lucas
now
sits
on
.

A
couple
major
factors
in
the
location
of
Lucas
Ohio
,
or
any
town
during
this
time
period
,
would
be
resources
around
it
.

The
village
is
placed
on
the
Pennsylvania
railroad
seven
miles
southeast
of
the
bigger
city
of
Mansfield
Ohio
and
is
also
located
on
the
Rockyfork
river
.

A
few
months
prior
to
the
founding
of
this
village
another
small
town
tried
to
start
down
stream
from
where
Lucas
would
soon
be
.

This
town
was
called
Octororo
.

When
Lucas
popped
up
a
rivalry
was
created
.

Lucas
won
this
rivalry
because
it
grew
faster
than
Octororo
.

To
this
day
there
is
no
remnants
of
the
failed
town
of
Octororo
.

One
of
the
reasons
Lucas
came
out
on
top
was
because
they
had
three
mill
sites
.

The
names
of
these
mills
were
LaRue
,
Zerby
,
and
Oldfield
.

The
Zerby
mill
was
build
in
0000
by
Peter
Zerby
.

In
0000
the
LaRue
and
Oldfield
mills
will
were
constructed
.

LaRue
mill
by
Mr.
LaRue
,
and
Oldfield
mill
by
Reinhart
Oldfield
.

The
Oldfield
mill
continued
operation
up
in
to
the
00
’s
while
being
owned
by
Colonel
George
Weaver
.

Another
reason
Lucas
was
successful
and
was
able
to
grow
so
fast
would
be
the
many
saw
mills
in
the
area
placed
on
the
Rockeyfork
River
.

The
first
house
in
Lucas
stood
where
the
bank
now
sits
on
Main
Street
.

About
half
a
dozen
lawyers
of
the
Mansfield
bar
were
from
Monroe
Township
,
these
men
all
went
on
to
hold
higher
offices
in
government
.

These
men
include
:
W.
S.
Kerr
,
N.
M.
Wolfe
,
C.
E.
McBride
,
A.
A.
Douglas

Douglas
,
J.
M.
Reed
,
J.
P.
Henry
,
Harry
T.
Manner
,
and
Allen
S.
Beach
.

Two
other
men
from
Monroe
Township
served
as
coroners
for
Richland
County
.

These
men
were
:
Dr.
W.
S.
Mecklem
and
Dr.
G.
W.
Baughman
.

These
men
,
like
many
others
from
Lucas
,
started
out
by
plowing
and
planting
fields
and
eventually
worked
their
way
up
.

Lucas
was
founded
in
0000
,
and
is
part
of
the
Mansfield
,
Ohio
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

In
0000
,
Lucas
was
made
famous
as
the
location
of
Humphrey
Bogart
and
Lauren
Bacall
's
wedding
.

They
were
married
on
May
00
at
Malabar
Farm
,
the
country
home
of
Pulitzer
Prize-winning
author
Louis
Bromfield
,
who
was
a
close
friend
of
Bogart
's
.

The
wedding
was
held
in
the
Big
House
.

In
0000
,
numerous
sequences
for
the
movie
The
Shawshank
Redemption
were
filmed
at
Malabar
Farm
in
Lucas
.

They
included
the
scene
at
the
beginning
of
the
movie
where
Andy
is
parked
outside
his
home
contemplating
murdering
his
wife
(
filmed
outside
of
Pugh
Cabin
)
,
and
the
oak
tree
and
rock
wall
scene
where
Red
finds
the
box
from
Andy
under
the
black
rock
.

The
oak
tree
is
clearly
visible
from
Bromfield
Road
,
and
the
adjacent
rock
wall
is
still
standing
to
this
day
.

employer
,
specializing
in

,
industrial

Film
industry
From

the
home
of
the

equipment
to
the

Department
to
film
the
escapades
of
some
of
the
city
's
homosexual
men
,
who
met
for
sexual
relations
in
an
underground
public
restroom
deep
in
the
bowels
of
Central

.

An

chapter
in
the
city

history
,
the
men
filmed

charged
under
Ohio
's
sodomy
law
,
and
all
served
a
minimum
of
one
year
in

state
penitentiary
.

The
resulting
footage
,
combined
with
overdubbed

was
eventually
compiled
by

E.
Jones
of
Massillon
,
Ohio
,
obtained
copies
of

Department
.

Jones
transferred
the
grainy
color
footage
of
the
original
police
surveillance
films
to
video
and
removed
the
police
commentary
,
presenting
it
as
a
silent
piece
entitled
Tearoom
(

)
.

film
was

History
The
original
town
of
Ontario
started
as
a
settlement
in
Springfield
Township
near
Mansfield
.

In
0000
,
the
Ontario
settlement
combined
with
another
small
settlement
known
as
New
Castle
.

Ontario
is
located
on
a
major
east-west
transportation
corridor
that
was
originally
known
in
the
early
0000s
as
"
Ohio
Market
Route

This

was

Upon

of
the
federal
numbered
highway
system
in
0000
,
the
Lincoln
Highway
through
Ontario
became
U.S.
Route
00
.

In
0000
,
General
Motors
built
a
large
Fisher
Body
stamping
plant
in
Ontario
and
on
June
00
,
0000
,
the
residents
voted
to
incorporate
Ontario
into
a
village
.

In
0000
,
the
new
Ontario
High
School
was
built
,
complete
with
an
indoor
swimming
pool
,
a
theatre
,
0
shops
,
and
numerous
high-tech
classrooms
and
labs
for
college-preparatory
studies
.

New
school
construction
and
renovation
has
continued
over
the
years
,
and
today
the
Ontario
School
District
enjoys
a
long
and
distinguished
reputation
for
education
excellence
with
state-of-the-art
facilities
.

In
0000
,
the
Richland
Mall
was
built
.

It
was
the
first
modern
enclosed
mall
in
north-central
Ohio
,
and
was
originally
anchored
by
the
prestigious
Lazarus
Department
Store
(
based
in
Columbus
)
,
the
O'Neil
's
Department
Store
(
based
in
Akron
)
,
and
by
Sears
.

The
Lazarus
store
was
the
first
Lazarus
built
outside
of
Columbus
.

The
store
's
unique
"
high-hat
"
entrance
tower
remains
visible
for
miles
along
U.S.
Route
00
.

The
Lazarus
store
eventually
became
Macy
's
,
and
then
subsequently
was
closed
in
0000
following
the
purchase
of
the
May
Department
Store
company
by
Federated
Department
Stores
,
parent
of
Macy
's
and
the
former
Lazarus
.

The
mall
in
0000
was
renamed
Westfield
Shoppingtown
Richland
for
a
period
of
time
,
is
once
again
called
Richland
Mall
following
a
name
change
in
0000
.

It
is
now
home
to
almost
00
stores
and
is
anchored
by
Macy
's
(
located
in
the
original
O'Neils
store
that
had
become
Kaufmann
's
for
a
period
of
time
)
,
Sears
,
and
JCPenney
(
a
later
addition
to
the
mall
)
.

The
arrival
of
both
General
Motors
and
the
Richland
Mall
to
Ontario
was
the
beginning
of
the
eventual
shift
of
commerce
and
industry
from
the
adjacent
rust
belt
city
of
Mansfield
to
the
new
suburb
-
satellite
town
of
Ontario
.

On
June
0
,
0000
,
General
Motors
filed
for
Chapter
00
bankruptcy
protection
and
announced
that
its
Ontario
stamping
plant
(
Mansfield-Ontario
Metal
Center
)
will
close
in
June
0000
.

Several
annexation
s
have
been
made
to
Ontario
since
its
incorporation
and
millions
of
dollars
have
been
spent
on
public
infrastructure
including
streets
,
water
and
sewer
facilities
,
parks
,
schools
,
and
new
civic
buildings
for
Administrative
offices
,
Public
Safety
Departments
and
the
Water
Department
.

The
city
administration
offices
have
been
housed
in
several
different
locations
including
the
"
Old
Library
"
which
is
now
being
used
as
a
Senior
Center
.

In
0000
,
the
city
's
offices
were
moved
to
the
newly
constructed
Charles
K.
Hellinger
Municipal
Building
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
Ontario
became
a
city
with
a
population
over
0,000
.

Since
the
0000s
,
Ontario
has
been
a
location
of
choice
for
residential
development
,
due
in
part
to
its
civic
administration
,
its
school
system
,
and
significant
commercial
and
industrial
development
.

only
city
in

center
of
the
Chillicothe
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
(
as
defined
by
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
in
0000
)
.

Chillicothe
is
a
designated
Tree
City
USA
by
the
National
Arbor
Day
Foundation
.

History
Chillicothe
was
the
first
and
third
capital
of
Ohio
and
is
located
in
southern
Ohio
along
the
Scioto
River
.

The
town
's
name
comes
from
the
Shawnee
Chala
·
ka
·
tha
,
named
after
one
of
the
five
major
divisions
of
the
Shawnee
people
,
as
it
was
the
chief
settlement
of
that
tribal
division
.

The
Shawnee
and
their
ancestors
inhabited
the
territory
for
thousands
of
years
prior
to
European
contact
.

At
the
time
of
European-American
settlement
,
the
community
was
plotted
by
General
Nathaniel
Massie
on
his
land
grant
.

Modern
Chillicothe
was
the
center
of
the
ancient
Hopewell
tradition
,
which
flourished
from
000
BCE
until
000
CE
.

This
Amerindian
culture
had
trade
routes
extending
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
.

They
built
earthen
mound
s
for
ceremonial
and
burial
purposes
throughout
the
Scioto
and
Ohio
River
valleys
.

Later
Native
Americans
who
inhabited
the
area
through
the
time
of
European
contact
included
Shawnees
.

Present-day
Chillicothe
is
the
most
recent
of
seven
locations
in
Ohio
that
bore
the
name
,
because
it
was
applied
to
the
main
town
wherever
the
Chalakatha
settled
.

It
was
after
the
American
Revolution
that
most
European
settlement
came
to
this
area
.

Migrants
from
Virginia
and
Kentucky
moved
west
along
the
Ohio
River
in
search
of
land
.

Chillicothe
served
as
the
capital
of
Ohio
from
the
beginning
of
statehood
in
0000
until
0000
when
Zanesville
became
the
capital
for
two
years
.

The
capital
was
moved
to
Zanesville
as
part
of
a
state
legislative
compromise
to
get
a
bill
passed
.

In
0000
the
legislature
moved
the
capital
back
to
Chillicothe
.

In
0000
the
state
legislature
voted
to
move
the
capital
again
,
to
Columbus
to
have
it
near
the
geographic
center
of
the
state
,
where
it
would
be
more
accessible
to
most
citizens
.

Migrants
to
Chillicothe
included
free
blacks
,
who
came
to
a
place
with
fewer
restrictions
than
in
the
slave
states
.

They
created
a
vibrant
community
and
aided
runaway
slaves
coming
north
.

As
tensions
increased
prior
to
the
breakout
of
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
free
black
community
at
Chillicothe
maintained
stations
and
aid
to
support
refugees
on
the
Underground
Railroad
.

Slaves
escaping
from
the
South
traveled
across
the
Ohio
River
to
freedom
,
and
then
up
the
Scioto
River
to
get
more
distance
from
their
former
homes
and
slave
hunters
.

White
abolitionist
s
aided
the
Underground
Railroad
as
well
.

orchestrated
the
establishment
of
a
school

became
the

Sample
plat
ted
South
Salem
in
0000
in
order
better
to
serve
the
students
and
teachers
of
the
school
.

After

,
the
village
reached
the
point

growth
ceased
.

Although

.

The
Salem
Academy
(
by
then
known
as
the
"
South
Salem
Academy
"
)
closed
in
0000
due
to
competition
from

schools
,
and
since
that
time
,
the
village
has
declined

point
on
the
Western
Reserve
and
Maumee
Turnpike
,
which
was
also
known
as
the
"
Old
Mud
Pike
"
because
of
the
thick
mud
that
often
mired
animals
and
vehicles
alike
.

It
was
the
first
permanent
route
across
the
Black
Swamp
.

The
toll
road
connected
Perrysburg
with
Lower
Sandusky
,
which
has
since
been
renamed
Fremont
.

A
mile
marker
from
the
road
remains
at

Street
,
in

the
village
pharmacy
.

Several
of
the
milestone
s
are
still
in

along
the
stretch
between
present
day
Fremont
and
Perrysburg
.

The
route
is
currently
designated
U.S.
Route
00
.

crosses
the
Portage
River
.

Railroad
also
crossed
the
Portage
River
in

to
Pittsburgh
.

A
half
mile
upstream
from
the
highway
and
the
rail
bridges
lies
Trailmarker
Park
.

This
is
site
of
a
shallow
point
in
the
river
where
Native
Americans
routinely
crossed
the
Portage
.

A
tree
that
was
bent
by
Native
Americans
to
mark
the
crossing
point
had
a
large
limb
that
stretched
over
the
west
bank
of
the
river
,
just
south
of
the
Cherry
Street
bridge
.

However
,
the
limb
was
mistakenly
removed
by
village
workers
in
the
0000s
.

The
origin
of
the
name
Woodville
is
often
attributed
to
General
Amos
E.
Wood
,

Wood
County
is
named
.

However
,
it
is
unclear
whether
this

History
In
0000
,
Sidney
Smith
hired
R.M.
Shoemaker
of
Cincinnati
to
survey
a
new
town
at
the
corners
of
sections
00
,
00
,
00
,
and
00
in
Scipio
Township
.

He
called
it
"
Republic
,
"
though
it
was
known
by
many
early
settlers
simply
as
"
Scipio
Center
.
"

With
the
arrival
of
a
rail
line
from
Sandusky
in
0000
,
Republic
became
a
popular
trading
center
.

Stores
,
warehouses
,
shops
,
and
factories
sprang
up
almost
overnight
.

And
,
a
second
rail
line
was
contemplated
between
Republic
and
Melmore
in
Eden
Township
.

When
the
old
Seneca
County
courthouse
at
Tiffin
burned
on
May
00
,
0000
,
efforts
were
made
to
establish
the
new
county
seat
at
Republic
.

Republic
's
fortunes
began
to
decline
when
the
new
Cincinnati
,
Sandusky
&
Cleveland
Railroad
bypassed
it
to
make
a
straight
run
to
Tiffin
,
although
it
experienced
something
of
a
revival
with
the
coming
of
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
.

The
railroad
passes
over
State
Route
00
over
an
arch
shaped
sonte
bypass
.

The
motto
for
the
village
is
"
Small
in
size
,
big
in
heart
"
which
was
selected
as
a
winner
in
a
contest
won
by
Michelle
Wheatley
along
with
an
accompanying
logo
which
celebrates
the
areas
agricultural
heritage

home
of
Heidelberg
University
and

University
.

At

and

manufacturing
center
.

History
The
history
of
Tiffin
dates
back
to
0000
.

The
familiar
bronze
statue
of
"
The
Indian
Maiden
"
on
Frost
Parkway
,
near
Miami
Street
,
marks
the
site
of
Fort
Ball
,
a
military
depot
of
the
war
of
0000
.

Fighting
an
engagement
of
that
war
,
Eratus
Bowe
first
sighted
the
location
upon
which
Tiffin
now
stands
.

In
0000
,
he
returned
to
the
site
and
built
his
Pan
Yan
Tavern
,
which
later
became
a
stagecoach
stop
,
on
the
north
sandusky
river
.

Early
homesteaders
followed
soon
after
Bowe
,
and
the
settlement
of
Oakley
sprang
up
around
the
Pan
Yan
.

The
main
traveled
road
of
the
area
followed
the
path
of
the
stagecoaches
through
Oakley
,
which
was
called
Fort
Ball
after
0000
.

In
0000
,
Josiah
Hedges
purchased
a
piece
of
land
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
opposite
Oakley
and
founded
another
settlement
.

He
named
this
village
"
Tiffin
"
in
honor
of
Edward
Tiffin
,
first
governor
of
Ohio
and
later
member
of
the
United
States
Senate
,
and
a
man
who
had
fought
to
finally
win
statehood
for
the
Ohio
Territory
in
0000
.

Tiffin
was
incorporated
by
an
act
of
the
Ohio
Legislature
on
March
0
,
0000
.

These
two
communities
,
split
by
the
Sandusky
River
,
were
rivals
;
however
,
in
0000
,
seeing
that
later
their
interests
lay
together
,
the
villages
merged
to
form

Fort
Loramie
is
a
village
in
Shelby
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
along
Loramie
Creek
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
village
was
founded
in
0000
.

History
In
0000
Pierre
Loramie
,
a
French-Canadian
fur
trader
built
a
trading
post
just
north
of
the
present-day
village
of
Fort
Loramie
.

Loramie
traded
in
furs
with
the
Wyandotte
and
Shawnee
Indian
tribes
.

During
the
0000
campaign
of
General
George
Rogers
Clark
,
Col.
Benjamin
Logan
led
an
attack
on
the
trading
post
,
and
it
was
burned
to
the
ground
.

In
0000
,
Anthony
Wayne
ordered
the
construction
of
Fort
Loramie
.

It
was
located
at
the
portage
between
St.
Mary
's
River
and
modern-day
Loramie
's
Creek
.

Wayne
initially
intended
Fort
Loramie
to
be
an
actual
stockade
,
but
after
defeating
the
natives
at
the
Battle
of
Fallen
Timbers
in
August
0000
,
he
determined
a
blockhouse
and
several
storage
buildings
were
more
important
.

He
now
intended
Fort
Loramie
to
be
a
supply
depot
for
American
fortifications
,
including
Fort
Wayne
,
Fort
Adams
,
and
Fort
Defiance
,
in
modern-day
northern
Ohio
.

In
December
0000
,
the
American
military
finally
completed
construction
of
the
buildings
.

During
the
War
of
0000
,
Fort
Loramie
served
as
a
supply
depot
for
forts
in
northern
Ohio
as
well
as
for
military
forces
sent
against
the
British
in
Michigan
and
Canada
.

In
0000
,
the
United
States
sold
Fort
Loramie
to
James
Furrow
,
who
created
a
tavern
and
post
office
out
of
the
buildings
.

In
0000
,
Furrow
gave
up
the
business
.

Despite
this
,
a
village
had
begun
to
form
.

Many
people
had
moved
from
eastern
Ohio
,
seeking
better
land
and
increased
opportunity
.

Most
of
the
early
migrants
were
of
German
descent
.

After
the
War
of
0000
,
settlement
began
in
the
Fort
Loramie
area
,
and
a
town
was
laid
out
and
surveyed
by
Jonathan
Counts
.

Lots
were
sold
at
auction
,
and
the
name
Berlin
was
given
to
the
town
.

When
work
started
on
the
Miami-Erie
Canal
in
0000
,
German
immigration
began
in
earnest
.

The
immigrants
came
mainly
as
laborers
on
the
canal
and
soon
purchased
land
and
became
permanent
settlers
.

The
canal
was
opened
in
0000
,
bringing
finished
goods
,
groceries
,
clothing
and
machinery
to
the
area
,
and
taking
wood
products
,
grain
,
pork
and
other
farm
items
back
to
the
cities
.

The
first
flour
mill
was
built
in
0000
,
and
the
first
general
store
,
Willman
's
,
was
established
the
same
year
.

Other
early
establishments
included
Quinlan
's
pharmacy
and
two
taverns
,
Bruckens
and
Vogelsang
's
Café
,
both
of
which
are
still
in
operation
.

The
first
church
,
St.
Michael
's
Catholic
Church
,
was
completed
in
0000
.

The
one-room
school
house
for
the
grade
school
(
grades
0-0
)
was
built
in
0000
just
east
of
St.
Michael
's
Church
.

In
0000
the
Fort
Loramie
Community
Fire
Co.
was
established
.

By
0000
,
the
canal
was
almost
a
thing
of
the
past
as
a
result
of
the
network
of
railroads
that
were
expanding
in
all
directions
.

The
canal
area
,
which
ran
through
the
center
of
town
,
fell
into
disrepair
,
but
was
cleaned
up
,
landscaped
,
and
turned
into
a
community
park
.

The
canal
area
north
of
town
is
part
of
a
Miami
and
Erie
Canal
Towpath
Hiking
Trail
.

The
most
important
feature
remaining
from
the
early
canal
days
is
Lake
Loramie
,
the
reservoir
that
kept
the
canal
filled
with
water
.

It
is
now
a
state
park
and
a
haven
for
fishermen
,
boaters
,
campers
,
and
vacationers
.

Port
Jefferson
is
a
village
in
Salem
Township
,
Shelby
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
First
known
as
Pratt
,
the
village
adopted
its
present
name
when
it
was
incorporated
on
April
00
,
0000
.

Port
Jefferson
was
located
where
the
Sidney
feeder
canal
connected
with
the
Great
Miami
River
.

The
purpose
of
the
feeder
was
to
provide
a
steady
flow
of
water
to
the
Miami
Canal
at
the
Lockington
Locks
.

A
large
dam
in
the
river
east
of
Port
Jefferson
diverted
the
waters
into
the
feeder
.

Because
Port
Jefferson
was
the
closest
point
on
the
canal
system
for
the
vast
territory
east
of
Sidney
and
Port
Jefferson
,
it
became
an
important
center
for
commercial
activity
almost
overnight
.

All
grain
,
lumber
,
and
other
products
north
and
east
of
town
,
destined
for
the
canal
,
passed
through
it
.

The
canal
feeder
at
Port
Jefferson
was
completed
to
Sidney
by
0000
,
some
0
years
before
the
Miami
&
Erie
Canal
was
opened
between
Cincinnati
and
Toledo
.

Samuel
Rice
heard
about
the
bright
economic
prospects
of
the
village
in
the
early
0000s
.

After
first
touring
a
small
underdeveloped
town
called
Chicago
in
northern
Illinois
,
he
traveled
here
,
evaluated
the
prospects
of
Port
Jefferson
,
and
chose
to
invest
here
.

He
purchased
a
substantial
amount
of
property
around
the
village
,
and
waited
.

During
its
heyday
between
0000
and
the
0000s
,
Port
Jefferson
almost
rivaled
Sidney
in
size
and
influence
.

Nearly
000
Port
Jefferson
men
worked
in
the
wooden
products
(
barrels
and
staves
)
business
.

Four
blacksmiths
,
including
Epler
and
Johnson
,
were
kept
busy
by
the
canal
boat
work
.

Gottlieb
Allinger
built
a
large
mill
on
the
canal
in
0000
,
now
the
site
of
the
locally
famous
Hussey
's
Restaurant
.

Three
dry
goods
stores
,
three
groceries
,
and
a
shoe
shop
blossomed
.

Construction
of
two
major
railroads
in
Sidney
by
0000
signaled
the
decline
of
the
canal
's
importance
and
that
of
Port
Jefferson
as
well
.

Samuel
Rice
's
bet
that
his
town
would
become
a
major
Midwest
trading
center
never
materialized
.

However
,
local
residents
did
refer
to
Port
Jefferson
as
'
Little
Chicago
'
for
a
number
of
years
.

Russia
is
a
village
in

Township
,
Shelby
County
,
Ohio
,
United

.

The
population
was
000
at

census

The
correct
local
pronunciation
is
"
roo-shee
"
,
with

.

History
Russia
was
founded
by
Lewis
Phillips
,
who
purchased
and
plotted
the
land
where
the
village
now
sits
.

Phillips
'
house
,
built
in
0000
,
was
the
first
house
in
Russia
;
other
settlers
followed
by
the
late
0000s
.

Phillips
was
also
the
first
businessman
in
the
village
,
opening
a
grocery
store
in
0000
.

Later
settlers
soon
founded
a
dry
goods
store
and
multiple
sawmill
s
;
Russia
's
economy
was
once
heavily
dependent
on
its
sawmills
.

Among
the
earliest
settlers
were
French
speaking
Suisse
who
had
served
under
L.
Napoleon
Bonaparte
during
the
war
with
Russia
.

One
such
survivor
Monnin
,
Jean
George
having
immigrated
to
the
USA
in
0000
,
brought
family
to
,
and
named
the
village
"
Russia
"
over
the
fact
that
it
reminded
him
the
Russian
front
during
the
war
0000
,
having
survived
!

Russia
was
established
in
an
area
that
was
already
predominately
French
.

In
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
a
large
number
of
emigrants
from
Alsace
,
Lorraine
,
and
other
parts
of
France
settled
in
southwestern
Shelby
County
and
the
adjacent
portions
of
northeastern
Darke
County
.

Besides
Russia
,
these
immigrants
founded
the
communities
of
Frenchtown
and
Versailles
.

By
the
middle
of
the
0000s
,
the
heavily
Roman
Catholic
population
had
grown
to
the
point
that
multiple
parish
es
were
established
in
the
area
.

A
log
church
was
built
and
dedicated
to
Saint
Remigius
,
the
patron
saint
of
France
,
and
Mass
was
first
celebrated
there
on
June
00
,
0000
.

The
congregation
soon
outgrew
its
building
and
constructed
a
new
brick
church
;
when
it
became
too
small
,
a
larger
brick
church
was
constructed
and
completed
in
0000
.

Today
,
St.
Remy
's
Catholic
Church
dominates
Russia
's
skyline
.

The
village
is
one
of
many
small
communities
in
a
heavily
Catholic
region
of
western
Ohio
known
as
the
"
Land
of
the
Cross-Tipped
Churches

History
From
the
0000s
to
0000
,
canal
boats
carried
Shelby
County
's
products
to
Cincinnati
or
Toledo
.

Sidney
was
crossed
by
the
Miami
and
Erie
Canal
's
Sidney
or
Port
Jefferson
Feeder
Branch
.

Before
railroads
came
to
Sidney
,
it
was
the
only
alternative
to
muddy
unpaved
roads
.

Part
of
the
canal
remains
south
of
Water
Street
.

The
City
of
Sidney
,
named
after
Sir
Philip
Sidney
,
a
well-known
poet
and
member
of
British
Parliament
,
was
originally
a
parcel
of
land
located
along
the
west
side
of
the
Great
Miami
River
.

This
land
was
donated
by
Charles
Starrett
to
be
used
as
the
site
of
a
new
town
which
was
to
become
the
county
seat
of
Shelby
County
.

The
area
around
Sidney
was
once
the
richly-forested
hunting
ground
of
the
Shawnee
and
Miami
Indian
nations
.

This
fertile
area
was
developed
as
agricultural
lands
over
time
.

The
construction
of
the
Miami-Erie
Canal
between
0000
and
0000
connected
Sidney
in
a
north/south
direction
with
the
major
trade
centers
in
Ohio
.

In
addition
to
opening
the
first
significant
"
outside
"
trade
for
Sidney
,
the
construction
of
the
canal
also
attracted
an
influx
of
settlers
to
the
area
.

As
the
influence
of
the
canal
declined
,
another
transportation
element
,
railroads
,
began
to
develop
in
Sidney
.

East-west
rail
began
to
be
laid
in
0000
,
followed
by
north-south
rail
in
0000
.

Sidney
is
still
served
by
these
railroad
lines
today
.

In
the
0000s
,
another
transportation
element
,
the
Interstate
Highway
,
would
play
a
significant
role
in
the
development
of
Sidney
which
later
helped
earn
its
title
"
All-America
City
"
in
0000
.

Today
,
Interstate
00
connects
Sidney
with
Canada
to
the
north
,
and
Florida
to
the
south
.

Sidney
has
four
interchanges
with
Interstate
00
,
providing
access
for
both
commercial
and
industrial
users
.

Sidney
is
located
north
of
Dayton
,
west
of
Columbus
,
south
of
Toledo
,
and
east
of
Indianapolis
.

Sidney
offers
an
historic
downtown
featuring
the
famous
Louis
Sullivan
designed
People
's
Savings
&
Loan
building
,
the
Monumental
Building
(
erected
as
a
monument
to
those
Shelby
Countians
who
died
in
the
Civil
War
)
,
and
the
Shelby
County
Courthouse
.

The
Courthouse
,
which
occupies
one
city-block
known
as
Court
Square
,
was
recently
named
as
one
of
the
"
Great
American
Public
Places
"
.

Another
characteristic
of
Sidney
is
its
parks
and
recreation
system
.

When
the
City
's
first
comprehensive
plan
was
being
developed
in
the
mid-0000s
,
the
City
decided
to
have
a
park
or
recreation
area
within
a
half-mile
of
every
residence
.

This
goal
has
resulted
in
a
system
of
00
neighborhood
parks
,
a
baseball
complex
,
softball
complex
,
soccer
complex
,
municipal
swimming
pool
,
and
the
Tawawa
Park
,
a
nature
and
picnic
area
.

Sidney
is
the
hometown
of
renowned
scientist
and
Nobel
Prize
winner
Paul
Lauterbur
,
who
was
involved
in
the
invention
of
the
MRI
.

In
0000
,
President
Ronald
Reagan
visited
the
city
of
Sidney
on
a
train
(
the
same
train
that
President
Roosevelt
traveled
on
during
his
visit
to
Sidney
in
0000
)
whilst
touring
the
country
.

Sidney
again
saw
another
President
enter
the
limits
of
the
city
when
President
Bush
visited
the
town
in
0000
,
eating
at
the
Spot
Restaurant
in
downtown
Sidney
.

Republican
presidential
candidate
Mitt
Romney
visited
the
Shelby
County
Fairgrounds
in
Sidney
in
0000
.

Sidney
,
Iowa
derives
its
name
from
the
community
.

The
town
of
Buckeye
,
Arizona
was
originally
named
after
Sidney
.

Malin
M.
Jackson
,
who
built
Arizona
's
Buckeye
Canal
,
was
from
Sidney
.

Rail
Sidney
has
two
railroad
lines
.

Both
were
built
independently
in
the
0000s
.

Until
the
0000s
one
could
board
the
Knickerbocker
Limited
in
Sidney
and
then
step
down
in
Grand
Central
Terminal
in
New
York
City
.

This
east-west
line
was
built
as
the
Bellefontaine
and
Indiana
Railroad
which
ran
from
Galion
,
Ohio
to
Union
City
on
the
Ohio-Indiana
border
.

It
was
built
in
conjunction
with
the
Indianapolis
and
Bellefontaine
Railroad
thus
providing
a
route
from
Cleveland
and
the
East
to
Indianapolis
,
and
later
St.
Louis
.

In
0000
,
the
two
were
merged
into
the
"
Bee
"
Line
:
the
Bellefontaine
Railway
,
in
0000
,
into
the
first
"
Big
Four
"
:
the
Cleveland
,
Columbus
,
Cincinnati
and
Indianapolis
Railway
,
and
in
0000
,
into
the
second
"
Big
Four
"
:
the
Cleveland
,
Cincinnati
,
Chicago
and
St.
Louis
Railway
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
this
railroad
relocated
its
tracks
from
downtown
Sidney
to
the
south
edge
of
the
city
over
the
then
new
Big
Four
concrete
arch
bridge
.

Early
in
the
twentieth
century
,
it
was
leased
by
the
New
York
Central
System
.

Later
the
Big
Four
was
taken
over
by
the
Penn
Central
,
then
Conrail
,
and
finally
CSX
Transportation
.

There
are
several
other
concrete
arch
bridges
similarly
designed
and
built
for
the
Big
Four
which
are
located
in
Avon
,
Indiana
,
Greencastle
,
Indiana
and
Danville
,
Illinois
in
addition
to
the
one
in
Sidney
.

In
the
0000s
one
could
board
a
train
in
Sidney
and
step
down
in
Cincinnati
or
New
Orleans
.

This
north-south
line
was
built
as
the
Dayton
and
Michigan
Railroad
.

In
the
0000s
it
was
leased
by
the
Cincinnati
,
Hamilton
and
Dayton
Railroad
.

It
was
taken
over
by
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
early
in
the
twentieth
century
.

Later
the
line
was
taken
over
by
the
Chesapeake
and
Ohio
Railroad
,
then
by
CSX
Transportation
.

Highway
system
The
Dixie
Highway
,
later

downtown
Sidney
,
connecting
it
with
Toledo
and

Canton
is
the
county
seat
of
Stark
County
in
northeastern
Ohio
,
approximately
south
of
Akron
and
south
of
Cleveland
.

The
City
of
Canton
is
the
largest
incorporated
area
in
the
Canton-Massillon
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
Canton-Massillon
metropolitan
area
,
which
includes
all
of
Stark
and
Carroll
counties
,
had
a
population
of
000,000
.

Founded
in
0000
on
the
West
and
Middle
Branches
of
the
Nimishillen
Creek
,
Canton
became
a
manufacturing
center
because
of
its
numerous
railroad
lines
.

After
the
decline
of
heavy
manufacturing
,
the
city
's
industry
diversified
into
service
economy
,
including
retailing
,
education
,
finance
,
and
healthcare
.

According
to
the
0000
census
,
Canton
's
population
declined
0.0
%
,
down
to
00,000
residents
.

Despite
this
decline
,
the
0000
figure
actually
had
moved
Canton
up
from
0th
to
0th
place
among
Ohio
cities
,
as
nearby
Youngstown
in
neighboring
Mahoning
County
,
once
considerably
more
populous
than
Canton
,
had
suffered
a
larger
decline
.

Canton
is
home
to
the
Pro
Football
Hall
of
Fame
,
the
McKinley
National
Memorial
,
the
William
McKinley
Presidential
Library
and
Museum
,
the
First
Ladies
National
Historic
Site
,
and
is
the
terminus
of
the
Cuyahoga
Valley
Scenic
Railroad
.

History
Canton
was
founded
in

.

Cantonrep.com
quotes
Kim
Kenney
,
the
curator
of
the
William
McKinley
Presidential
Library
&
Museum
,
whose
information
came
from
E.T.
Heald
's
series
,
The
Stark
County
Story
,
as
saying
that
Canton
was
incorporated
as
a
village
in
0000
,
and
then
as
a
city
in
0000
.

Bezaleel
Wells
,
the
surveyor
who
divided
the
land
of
the
town
,
named
it
after
Canton
(
a
traditional
name
for
Guangzhou
)
,
China
.

The
name
was
a
memorial
to
a
trader
named
John
O'Donnell
,
whom
Wells
admired
.

O'Donnell
had
named
his
Maryland
plantation
after
the
Chinese
city
,
as
he
had
been
the
first
person
to
transport
goods
from
there
to
Baltimore
.

Canton
was
the
adopted
home
of
President
William
McKinley
.

Born
in
Niles
,
McKinley
first
practiced
law
in
Canton
around
0000
,
and
was
prosecuting
attorney
of
Stark
County
from
0000
to
0000
.

The
city
was
his
home
during
his
successful
campaign
for
Ohio
governor
,
the
site
of
his
front-porch
presidential
campaign
of
0000
and
the
campaign
of
0000
.

Canton
is
now
the
site
of
the
William
McKinley
Presidential
Library
and
Museum
and
the
McKinley
National
Memorial
,
dedicated
in
0000
.

Geography
Address
system
Canton
's
street
layout
forms
the
basis
for
the
system
of
addresses
in
Stark
County
.

Canton
proper
is
divided
into
address
quadrants
(
NW
,
NE
,
SW
,
SE
)
by
Tuscarawas
Street
(
dividing
N
and
S
)
and
Market
Avenue
(
dividing
E
and
W
)
.

Due
to
shifts
in
the
street
layout
,
the
E-W
divider
becomes
Cleveland
Avenue
south
of
the
city
,
merging
onto
Ridge
Road
farther
out
.

The
directionals
are
noted
as
suffixes
to
the
street
name
(
e.g.
Tuscarawas
St
W
,
00th
Street
NE
)
.

Typically
within
the
city
numbered
streets
run
east
and
west
and
radiate
from
the
Tuscarawas
Street
baseline
,
while
named
avenues
run
north
and
south
.

This
system
extends
into
Stark
County
but
is
not
shared
by
the
cities
of
Massillon
,
East
Canton
or
North
Canton
,
which
have
their
own
internal
address
grids
.

Government
Canton
works
under
a
mayor
–
council
government
and
it
is
the
largest
city
in
Ohio
to
operate
without
a
charter
.

The
city
council
is
divided
among
nine
wards
with
three
at-large
seats
and
the
council
president
.

The
current
mayor
is
William
J.
Healy
II
,
a
Democrat
who
is
currently
in
his
second
term
.

Economy
The
Canton
area
's
economy
is
primarily
industrial
,
with
a
significant
agricultural
segment
.

The
city
is
home
to
the
Timken
Company
,
a
major
manufacturer
of
tapered
roller
bearings
and
specialty
steel
.

Several
other
large
companies
operate
in
the
greater-Canton
area
,
including
the
Belden
Brick
Company
(
brick
and
masonry
producer
)
and
Diebold
(
ATMs
,
electronic
voting
devices
,
and
bank
vaults
)
.

The
area
is
also
home
to
several
regional
food
producers
,
including
Nickles
Bakery
(
baked
goods
)
,
Park
Farms
(
poultry
)
and
Shearer
's
Foods
(
snack
foods
)
.

Poultry
production
and
dairy
farming
are
also
important
segments
of
the
Canton-area
economy
.

As
in
many
industrial
areas
of
the
United
States
,
employment
in
the
manufacturing
sector
is
in
a
state
of
long-term
decline
.

LTV
Steel
(
formerly
Republic
Steel
)
had
been
a
large
employer
before
its
bankruptcy
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
Timken
Company
proposed
moving
its
Canton-based
bearing
production
to
plants
in
the
South
.

While
Timken
's
steel
production
remains
centered
around
Canton
,
this
has
struck
a
blow
to
the
economy
and
the
city
's
image
and
pride
.

The
Hoover
Company
(
vacuum
and
floor
cleaners
)
had
been
an
iconic
part
of
North
Canton
for
more
than
00
years
.

It
was
purchased
by
Techtronic
Industries
Co
Ltd
from
the
Whirlpool
Corporation
in
January
0000
,
resulting
in
the
June
0000
closure
of
the
original
North
Canton
site
.

In
response
to
these
manufacturing
losses
,
the
area
is
undergoing
a
transition
to
a
retail
and
service-based
economy
.

Canton
,
like
many
mid-size
American
cities
,
has
lost
most
of
its
downtown
retail
business
to
the
suburbs
.

The
lion
's
share
of
the
Canton
area
's
retail
is
located
in
the
general
vicinity
of
the
Westfield
Belden
Village
Mall
in
Jackson
Township
.

In
recent
years
,
the
downtown
area
has
seen
some
rejuvenation
,
with
cafes
,
restaurants
,
and
art
galleries
springing
up
.

Despite
the
exodus
of
most
of
the
city
's
retail
to
the
Belden
Village
area
,
a
few
retail
centers
remain
in
Canton
(
at
or
near
the
city
limits
)
.

Tuscarawas
Street
(
Lincoln
Way
)
,
a
leg
of
the
Lincoln
Highway
connecting
Canton
with
neighboring
Massillon
,
is
home
to
the
Canton
Centre
Mall
and
several
retail
outlets
of
varying
size
.

A
vein
of
commerce
runs
along
Whipple
Ave
,
connecting
the
Canton
Centre
area
with
the
Belden
Village
area
.

A
similar
vein
runs
north
from
the
downtown
area
,
along
Cleveland
and
Market
Avenues
.

Connecting
Cleveland
and
Market
Avenues
is
a
small
shopping
district
on
00th
St.
NW
,
and
retail
lines
the
Route
00
corridor
leading
from
Canton
to
Louisville
and
Alliance
.

Arts
and
education
The
Canton
Museum
of
Art
,
founded
in
0000
,
is
a
broad-based
community
arts
organization
designed
to
encourage
and
promote
the
fine
arts
in
Canton
.

The
museum
focuses
on
00th
and
00th
Century
American
artists
,
specifically
works
on
paper
,
and
on
American
ceramics
,
beginning
in
the
0000s
.

The
museum
sponsors
annual
shows
of
work
of
high
school
students
in
Canton
and
Stark
County
,
and
financial
scholarships
are
awarded
.

Educational
Outreach
programs
take
the
museum
off-site
to
libraries
,
parochial
schools
,
area
public
schools
,
five
inner
city
schools
and
a
school
for
students
with
behavioral
disorders
.

The
city
's
Arts
District
,
located
downtown
,
is
the
site
of
monthly
First
Friday
arts
celebrations
.

Canton
's
K-00
students
are
primarily
served
by
the
Canton
City
School
District
,
although
students
north
of
00th
St.
NW
have
an
overlap
with
Plain
Local
School
District
.

Canton
Local
School
District
serves
the
better
part
of
Canton
South
.

Malone
University
,
a
private
,
four-year
liberal
arts
college
affiliated
with
the
Evangelical
Friends
Church
,
is
located
on
00th
St.
N.W.
Catholic-run
Walsh
University
is
located
nearby
in
North
Canton
.

Stark
State
College
and
a
branch
of
Kent
State
University
are
also
nearby
,
in
Jackson
Township
.

Also
,
in
downtown
Canton
,
there
is
a
small
annex
for
Stark
State
College
to
be
used
by
the
Early
College
High
School
students
who
are
located
on
the
Timken
Campus
.

The
city
is
also
served
by
two
Catholic
high
schools
---
St.
Thomas
Aquinas
High
School
and
Central
Catholic
High
School
(
located
in
Perry

East
Sparta
is
a
village
in
Stark
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Canton
–
Massillon
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
mayor
is
Mike
Stephens
.

History
The
village
of
Sparta
was
established
on
March
00
,
0000
by
Amos
Janney
in
the
southeastern
part
of
Pike
Township
.

Janney
chose
the
name
as
the
rival
of
Athens
.

The
name
of
the
village
would
later
be
changed
to
East
Sparta
because
of
a
second
village
in
Ohio
called
Sparta
,
Ohio
.

Janney
built
the
first
flour
mill
and
sawmill
.

In
0000
Janney
put
an
ad
in
the
paper
announcing
a
new
product
he
called
Friction
Rollers
.

Originally
founded
as
a
trading
area
with
a
flour
mill
,
bloomery
and
sawmill
it
later
became
an
important
manufacturing
center
in
Stark
County
.

The
reason
is
that
the
roots
of
the
steel
production
which
developed
in
stark
county
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
00th
century
go
back
to
pioneer
days
and
the
first
foundry
built
by
Luther
Drury
.

Abraham
Cozier
who
opened
a
small
store
in
0000
also
provided
his
home
as
the
birth
place
of
Sparta
's
two
churches
,
the
Methodist
and
the
Christian
.

At
the
opposite
end
of
society
from
the
churches
'
were
the
taverns
which
got
an
early
start
in
Sparta
.

Philip
Weaver
is
credited
with
running
the
first
saloon
in
0000
.

In
pioneer
days
Pike
Township
had
more
than
its
share
of
distilleries
,
saloons
,
drinking
and
law
suits
,
but
the
excess
produced
reaction
,
and
Pike
Township
residents
voted
the
township
dry
and
later
prided
themselves
on
having
fewer
criminals
and
less
litigation
than
any
other
township
in
the
county
.
