McClure
is
a
borough
in
Snyder
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
town
is
named
for
Alexander
Kelly
McClure
.

McClure
owes
its
origin
to
the
building
of
the
Sunbury-Lewistown
railroad
,
that
at
one
time
ran
through
the
center
of
town
.

The
town
was
founded
in
0000
.

The
borough
of
McClure
was
established
on
January
0
,
0000
,
when
the
residents
decided
to
incorporate
.

The
town
was
originally
named
Stuckton
after
George
Stuck
who
owned
the
farm
land
that
today
is
known
as
McClure
.

In
the
year
0000
,
when
it
was
certain
that
the
Middlecreek
Valley
railroad
would
be
located
practically
through
the
center
of
the
Stuck
Farm
,
George
Stuck
staked
out
a
section
of
his
farm
,
laid
out
a
few
lots
and
named
the
place
“
STUCKTON
.

”
Thus
a
town
was
born
,
but
without
houses
,
except
an
old
rotted
log
hut
.

It
remained
as
such
for
the
next
four
years
.

No
one
seemed
interested
in
buying
lots
or
building
a
home
.

Middleburg
is
a
borough
in
Snyder
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Snyder
County
.

History
Native
Americans
had
lived
in
the
region
for
centuries
.

White
settlers
are
recorded
living
in
the
area
in
0000
.

Middleburg
was
originally
named
Swinefordstown
(
Swinefordstettle
in
the
Pennsylvania
Dutch
dialect
)
after
John
Albright
Swineford
who
ran
a
tavern
here
in
0000
.

He
was
also
the
owner
of
land
located
on
the
north
bank
of
the
Middle
Creek
on
which
engineer
Frederick
Evans
laid
out
the
town
in
0000
.

This
town
became
known
as
Middleburgh
circa
0000
,
and
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

A
portion
of
the
site
that
Middleburg
occupies
was
the
location
of
the
Stump
's
Run
Massacre
in
January
of
0000
.

Stump
's
Run
is
located
to
the
west
of
the
Glendale
Cemetery
and
is
also
near
the
Snyder
County
Historical
Society
.

In
this
incident
,
two
colonists
named
Frederick
Stump
and
John
Ironcutter
were
found
to
be
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
four
Native
American
men
,
three
Native
American
women
,
and
three
children
over
a
two-day
period
.

Four
of
the
men
and
two
of
the
women
were
killed
at
Stump
's
cabin
,
which
was
located
at
the
mouth
of
the
Middle
Creek
near
Selinsgrove
.

After
Stump
and
Ironcutter
shoved
the
bodies
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
,
they
traveled
up
the
creek
to
Stump
's
Run
to
kill
the
remaining
woman
and
the
children
.

These
bodies
were
thrown
into
the
native
cabins
,
and
the
cabins
burned
.

Although
the
men
claimed
self-defense
,
it
is
suspected
that
this
could
have
been
provoked
by
a
drunken
brawl
,
or
that
the
natives
were
killed
by
Stump
in
retaliation
for
the
deaths
of
his
wife
and
children
at
the
hands
of
Native
American
raiders
.

The
two
men
were
arrested
and
taken
to
the
Cumberland
County
jail
at
Carlisle
for
trial
,
but
were
freed
at
the
hands
of
a
sympathetic
mob
.

The
men
were
never
recaptured
.

The
section
of
the
borough
located
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
Middle
Creek
was
developed
in
a
manner
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
settlement
on
the
northern
bank
.

This
portion
of
the
town
began
with
a
few
pioneer
homes
and
a
grist
mill
known
as
the
Franklin
Roller
Mills
.

When
the
Sunbury
and
Lewistown
Railroad
was
constructed
,
more
lots
for
homes
were
laid
out
,
and
the
southern
section
of
the
town
was
first
known
as
Franklin
,
and
later
,
Swineford
.

In
January
0000
,
the
property
owners
in
Swineford
petitioned
the
Middleburgh
borough
for
annexation
,
and
this
wish
was
granted
in
February
of
the
same
year
.

Despite
the
fact
that
the
two
towns
were
united
under
one
government
in
0000
,
two
separate
and
distinct
post
offices
operated
in
the
borough
until
March
0000
,
when
the
Swineford
post
office
was
closed
.

The
Swineford
name
is
still
used
by
the
Swineford
National
Bank
,
which
was
founded
in
Swineford
in
0000
and
is
listed
as
a
part
of
the
Fulton
Financial
Family
in
0000
.

A
major
employer
in
the
town
following
the
Second
World
War
was
the
Middleburg
Tannery
.

This
facility
employed
nearly
sixty
men
and
tanned
high
grade
sole
leather
.

Most
of
the
raw
material
used
at
the
plant
came
from
South
America
,
and
many
of
the
finished
products
were
used
in
the
manufacture
of
Florsheim
Shoes
.

The
tannery
complex
was
leveled
by
a
devastating
fire
in
June
0000
and
it
was
never
rebuilt
.

Middleburg
is
also
home
to
the
main
processing
plant
of
Ira
Middleswarth
and
Son
,
Inc.
,
the
manufacturer
of
Middleswarth
Potato
Chips
.

Environmental
Issues
Ongoing
pollution
and
soil
erosion
in
the
region
continue
to
degrade
the
water
quality
and
the
environment
locally
as
well
as
regionally
.

Farming
,
wastewater
treatment
facilities
and
industrial
spills
are
cited
as
contributing
factors
to
loss
of
water
quality
.

It
also
contributes
to
the
pollution
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
.

Controlling
the
wastewater
discharges
alone
is
expected
to
cost
local
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
.

The
township
(
and

is
home
to
most
of
Snyder
County
's
commercial
activity
and
serves
as
the
location
for
nearly
all
of
the
county
's
national-chain
retail
outlets
,
hotels
,
and
restaurants
.

The
Susquehanna
Valley
Mall
is
in
Monroe
Township
.

The
most
recent
addition
is
Monroe
Marketplace
,
a
collection
of
department
stores
and
restaurants
which
was
developed
on
farmland
and
the
site
of
a
former
church
camp
along
U.S.
Routes
00
&

.

It
was
fully
completed
in

Nearly
every

"
retail
format
(
e.g.
home
improvement
,
general
merchandise
,
grocery
,
department
store
,
and
consumer
electronics
)
has
a
presence
in
the
township
.

U.S.
Routes
00
&

combine
at
the
township
's
north
end
and
continue
southward
through
the
township
in
a
combined
fashion
.

The
highway
is
a
major
travel
artery
through
the
region
.

Day
time
flow
is
constant
(
truck
and

)
with
very
heavy
loads
and
serious
backups
on

holiday
weekends

A
thruway
project
has
been
in
the
works
to
allow
traffic
to
bypass
the
congested
commercial
area
,
with
only
a
portion
(
that
which
bypasses
Selinsgrove
)
having
ever
been
completed
.

The
remaining
portion
which
would
lie
in
Monroe
Township
exists
only
as
a
concept
.

Residents
along
the
proposed
route
have
expressed
concerns
about
the
negative
impact
on
their
quality
of
life
that
the
thruway
will
mean
.

Others
are
concerned
that
the
bypass
will
mean
a
loss
of
business
that
the
traffic
on
highway
brings
to
restaurants
and
hotels
along
the
current
route
.

The
primary
inhibition
to
construction
is
a
lack
of
funding
for
the
estimated
$
000
million
project
.

The
village
of
Paxtonville
lies
on
Middle
Creek
in
Pennsylvania
and
is
connected
to
Middleburg
,
Koonhunter
and
Beavertown
by
the
Paxtonville
Road
.

Settled
in
the
late
00th
century
,
it
was
first
known
as
Kern
's
Mill
,
but
was
renamed
after
Robert
Paxton
.

Just
after
the
Civil
War
an
iron
furnace
was
built
there
,
but
it
fell
into
disuse
after
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
when
richer
ores
were
found
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
.

In
the
early
years
of
the
00th
century
,
brick-making
was
a
major
industry
,
but
this
ended
in
the
summer
of
0000
when
fire
destroyed
the
Paxton
Brick
Company
.

A
water-powered
sawmill
and
cider
press
were
in
operation
about
0000
.

At
various
times
businesses
included
a
creamery
,
a
restaurant
,
a
cigar
factory
,
a
shirt
factory
,
one
or
two
general
stores
,
a
barbershop
,
a
grist
mill
and
a
gunsmith
.

As
of
December
0000
,
the
town
boasts
a
church
and
a
feed
mill
,
as
well
as
a
community
center
.

The
building
housing
the
community
center
was
previously
a
two
room
school
house
in
which
instruction
was
provided
for
grades
0
through
0
.

Its
last
use
for
this
purpose
was
in
the
Spring
of
0000
;
after
this
time
pupils
were
bussed
to
Middleburg
.

Around
0000
a
school
building
stood
on
the
north-east
corner
of
Mill
Street
and
the
Paxtonville
Road
.

The
soil
underlying
the
village
is
principally
glacial
till
,
but
about
000
feet
west
and
00
feet
south
of
the
juncture
of
the
Paxtonville
Road
and
Paxton
Street
sedimentary
rock
lies
just
beneath
the
soil
surface
.

Stone
American
Indian
artifacts
,
chiefly
arrow
and
spear
points
,
are
to
be
found
at
the
north
edge
of
town
near
the
bank
of
Middle
Creek
.

The
completion
of
the
Sunbury
and
Lewistown
Railroad
in
the
0000s
connected
Paxtonville
with
these
two
cities
,
and
for
many
years
a
number
of
daily
passenger
trains
stopped
at
the
Paxtonville
station
,
which
was
located
near
the
creek
.

Passenger
service
ended
in
the
late
0000s
.

For
a
short
period
of
time
,
toward
the
end
of
the
00th
century
,
Paxtonville
was
shown
on
railroad
maps
as
Benfer
.

A
number
of
the
oldest
houses
are
log
,
but
this
construction
is
not
evident
because
they
have
frame
or
shingle
siding
;
they
date
from
the
early
00th
century
.

As
of
0000
there
stands
on
the
south
side
of
Maple
Avenue
,
about
000
feet
west
of
the
intersection
with
Paxton
Street
,
a
house
of
unusual
construction
.

Built
by
Gabriel
Gill
about
0000
,
it
lacks
a
frame
,
but
the
exterior
walls
serve
this
purpose
,
being
constructed
of
three
layers
of
one
inch
planks
,
with
the
middle
layer
running
at
a
00
degree
angle
to
the
other
two
which
is
one
form
of
vertical
plank
wall
construction
.

Over
the
years
most
residents
have
been
of
Pennsylvania-Dutch
ancestry
,
as
witnessed
by
family
names
such
as
Walter
,
Gill
,
Straub
and
Musser
.

About
0000
the
cemetery
was
moved
from
behind
its
position
behind
the
church
on
the
east
edge
of
the
village
to
its
modern
location
on
the
south-west
edge
.

Coffins
and
their
contents
were
carried
on
horse-drawn
wagons
.

Immediately
after
World
War
I
donations
from
townspeople
allowed
the
erection
of
the
Memorial
Hall
on
the
west
side
of
Paxton
Street
.

It
served
a
number
of
functions
,
including
showing
movies
.

During
the
era
of
silent
films
these
were
accompanied
by
the
Paxtonville
Orchestra
.

Eastern
Snyder
County
.

A
regional
plan
has
been
developed
by
Shamokin
Dam
borough
,
Selingrove
borough
,
Monroe
Township
,
and
Penn
Township
officials
.

Their
hope
is
to
garner
state
tax
dollars
through
grant
and
matching
fund
applications
.

Officials
assert
that
a
poll
of
00
%
of
residents
showed
that
they
were
willing
to
paying
higher
taxes
to
add
more
recreation
facilities
to
the
area
.

The
East
Snyder
Park
is
a
multiuse
facility
which
is
under
development
using
state
grants
and
local
donations
.

It
is
located
along
the
upper
end
of
University
Ave.
near
Rt.
000
,
at
the
location
of
the
existing
Penn
Township
ball
fields
.

The
master
plan
of
the
park
calls
for
nine
professional
grade
horseshoe
pits
,
baseball
,
softball
,
football
and
soccer
fields
,
a
preschool
playground
with
age
appropriate
apparatus
(
Kaboom
grant
)
a
playground
for
older
children
,
and
a
small
wetland
conservation
education
area
.

The
facilities
are
governed
by
the
East
Snyder
Regional
Recreation
Association
,
a
000
(
c
)
organization
with
a
board
made
up
of
interested
parties
,
local
youth
recreation
organization
representatives
and
area
government
officials
.

One
concept
brought
out
in
the
Park
,
Recreation

Plan
is
for
the
region
to
market

recreation
opportunities
.

Environmental
Issues
Ongoing
pollution
and
soil
erosion
in
the
region
continue
to
degrade
the
water
quality
and
the
environment
locally
as
well
as
regionally
.

Farming
,
wastewater
treatment
facilities
and
industrial
spills
are
cited
as
contributing
factors
to
loss
of
water
quality
.

It
also
contributes
to
the
pollution
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
.

Controlling
the
wastewater
discharges
alone
is
expected
to
cost
local
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
.

Ground

History
The
name
of
the
town
comes
from
its
days
as
a
coal
port
on
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
.

Coal
from
the
mines
of
the
Zerbe
Valley
,
near
Trevorton
was
shipped
to
the
town
via
the
Trevorton
and
Susquehanna
Railroad
,
which
was
completed
in
0000
,
crossing
the
Susquehanna
River
on
a
long
bridge
from
Herndon
to
Port
Trevorton
.

A
canal
basin
was
built
for
coal
loading
from
the
railcars
.

However
,
a
new
route
was
built
to
the
coal
mines
via
Shamokin
,
and
the
bridge
was
removed
in
0000
.

As
the
fortunes
of
the
canal
declined
,

too
did
those
of
the
town
.

commissioned
a
study
regarding
what
matters
most
in

They
found
that
some
major
concerns
were
:
alcohol
and
drug
use
among
all
age
groups
and
its
effects
on
the
community
,
the
dependency

The
master
plan
of
the
park
calls
for
nine
professional
grade
horseshoe
pits
,
baseball
,
softball
,
football
and
soccer
fields
,
a

Shamokin
Dam
is
a
small
borough
in
Snyder
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
name
is
derived
from
a
dam
that
was
built
across
the
Susquehanna
River
in
the
00th
century
.

The
dam
supported
steamboat
ferries
run
by
Ira
T.
Clement
,
which
transported
goods
and
people
between
Shamokin
Dam
and
the
city
of
Sunbury
on
the
Northumberland
County
side
of
the
river
.

These
ferries
operated
from
0000
until
the
Bainbridge
Street
Bridge
was
built
in
0000
.

The
dam
also
provided
water
to
the
Susquehanna
Division
of
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
System
which
was
constructed
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
.

The
dam
was
destroyed
by
ice
in
March
0000
.

Geography
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
is
land
and
(
0.00
%
)
is
water
.

Shamokin
Dam
sits
on
the
western
bank
of
the
Susquehanna
River
just
south
of
the
confluence
of
the
river
's
west
and
north
branches
.

The
borough
is
also
bordered
by
the
community
of
Hummels
Wharf
,
Monroe
Township
,
and
U.S.
Route
00
.

The
Norfolk
Southern
Railway
(
formerly
Conrail
/
Penn
Central
/
Pennsylvania
Railroad
)
passes
through
the
borough
between
the
Old
Trail
Road
and
the
Susquehanna
River
.

There
are
several
small
unnamed
creeks
that
cross
the
borough
eventually
draining
into
the
Susquehanna
River
.

Seasonal
flooding
occurs
in
the
lowlands
between
the
rail
line
and
the
river
where
the
canal
once
passed
.

Some
areas
of
the
borough
lie
in
the
000
year
flood
plain
.

For
many
years
addresses
in
Shamokin
Dam
were
listed
under
the
same
zip
code
as
Selinsgrove
which
was
00000
.

This
led
to
confusion
by
delivery
companies
,
emergency
services
and
visitors
to
the
region
.

Additionally
,
tax
funding
that
should
have
gone
to
Shamokin
Dam
was
lost
.

The
implementation
of
the
GIS
readdressing
program
required
that
several
local
communities
rename
streets
so
that
there
were
no
redundancies
within
the
Selinsgrove
zip
code
.

This
prompted
Shamokin
Dam
officials
to
appeal
to
the
United
States
Postal
Service
for
a
unique
zip
code
.

Shamokin
Dam
addresses
became
00000
.

History
Pennsylvania
was
,
for
centuries
,
the
home
of
many
Native
American
tribes
.

During
the
00th
century
the
region
was
dominated
by
the
Haudenosaunee
Iroquois
Confederacy
,
which
included
the
Mohawk
s
,
the
Onondaga
s
,
the
Cayuga
s
,
the
Tuscarora
s
,
the
Seneca
s
and
the
Oneida
s.
Under
the
Confederacy
the
area
was
hunting
grounds
for
the
Delaware
,
Shawnee
,
Conoy
,
Monsey
,
Mohican
and
Nanticoke
peoples
.

Allummapeed
was
a
Delaware
chief
who
lived
in
Shamokin
(
now
called
Sunbury
)
.

Shikellamy
,
of
the
Oneida
people
,
came
to
the
region
.

He
negotiated
with
the
white
settlers
on
behalf
of
the
native
residents
.

In
0000
,
Chief
Shikellamy
negotiated
with
Conrad
Weiser
to
set
the
Blue
Mountain
s
as
the
upper
limit
settlement
in
the
native
people
's
home
lands
.

Weiser
told
the
area
's
settlers
they
could
not
remain
.

The
Six
Nations
Treaty
of
0000
permitted
settlements
to
move
west
of
the
Susquehanna
River
into
lands
that
eventually
became
Snyder
County
.

Many
natives
argued
they
had
been
cheated
by
the
treaty
.

Conflicts
between
the
settlers
and
the
native
peoples
resulted
in
deaths
on
both
sides
.

Eventually
,
the
native
peoples
were
pushed
out
by
the
white
settlers
after
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

Germans
were
among
the
first
European
settlers
in
the
region
.

Their
influence
continues
today
in
the
presence
of
the
Amish
and
Mennonite
sects

closed
the
bridge
at
night
.

A
bell
was
posted
to
summon
the
toll
worker
during
the
night
.

The
bridge
was
used
by

Economics
The
coal
fired
Sunbury
power
plant
was
commissioned
by
the
Pennsylvania
Power
&
Light
company
in
0000
.

It
went
into
operation
in
0000
.

The
Sunbury
Generation
Station
is
located
along
the
Susquehanna
River
in
Shamokin
Dam
,
Pennsylvania
.

The
plant
was
purchased
by
WPS
Power
Development
in
November
0000
from
PP&L
Resources
.

The
plant
is
part
of
the
Pennsylvania/New
Jersey/Maryland
(
PJM
)
market
area
.

Power
from
the
plant
is
sold
into
Pennsylvania
’s
deregulated
electric
market
.

In
May
0000
,
the
facility
's
emission
allowances
for
both
sulfur
dioxide
(
SO0
)
and
nitrogen
oxides
(
NOX
)
were
sold
and
a
seasonal
operation
plan
was
announced
.

Then
in
July
0000
the
plant
was
sold
to
Corona
Power
,
LLC
.

The
gross
proceeds
received
by
WPS
for
the
000.0
megawatt
power
plant
were
about
$
00.0
million
,
and
were
subject
to
certain
working
capital
and
other
post-closing
adjustments
.

In
0000
,
Corona
Power
,
LLC
sought
and
won
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
tax
assessment
of
the
property
.

The
assessment
was
cut
by
more
than
two
thirds
.

Additionally
,
there
is
a
freeze
on
the
assessment
for
several
years
regardless
of
improvements
made
on
the
property
.

While
the
future
of
the
Sunbury
Generation
facility
seemed
to
be
in
good
hands
with
its
purchase
by
Corona
Power
in
0000
,
in
October
0000
Corona
Power
,
LLC
working
with
Merrill
Lynch
started
the
process
of
seeking
buyers
for
the
000
megawatt
Sunbury
Generation
facility
.

Several
other
major
local
businesses
including
Kmart
and
Wal-Mart
in
Hummels
Wharf
and
housing
units
in
Selinsgrove
borough
have
been
successful
in
appealing
their
property
tax
assessments
as
well
.

There
is
also
a
new
development
called
the
Monroe
Marketplace
which
contains
businesses
such
as
Target
,
Kohl
's
,
and
Giant
.

U.S.
Routes
00
and
00
pass
through
the
borough
.

The
highway
is
a
major
travel
artery
through
the
region
.

Flow
is
constant
(
truck
and
vehicle
)
with
very
heavy
loads
and
backups
on
Fridays
(
especially
in
the
afternoon
)
and
holiday
weekends
.

There
is
a
proposed
major
highway
bypass
project
called
the
Central
Susquehanna
Valley
Thruway
.

It
is
meeting
with
funding
challenges
that
have
delayed
the
project
for
decades
.

This
thruway
will
cross
Monroe
Township
just
north
of
Shamokin
Dam
.

Many
residential
properties
are
designated
for
eminent
domain
actions
.

Residents
along
the
proposed
route
have
expressed
concerns
about
the
negative
impact
on
their
quality
of
life
that
the
thruway
will
mean
.

Pro
development
forces
have
been
successful
in
overwhelming
their
objections
.

Others
are
concerned
that
,
like
the
town
of
Selinsgrove
which
is
in
decline
,
the
bypass
will
mean
the
loss
of
local
revenue
and
jobs
that
the
travelers
on
the
highway
bring
to
the
many
local
restaurants
and
hotels
located
along
the
current
Rte
00
&
00
highway
.

In
June
0000
another
two-year
delay
was
announced
by
the
Pennsylvania
Department
of
Transportation
.

The
primary
roadblock
is
a
lack
of
funding
for
the
estimated
over
$
000
million
dollar
project
.

The
state
's
transportation
has
historically
been
grossly
underfunded
.

This
has
resulted
in
hundreds
of
bridges
and
roads
in
need
of
repair
.

Environmental
Issues
Ongoing
pollution
and
soil
erosion
in
the
region
continue
to
degrade
the
water
quality
and
the
environment
locally
as
well

regionally
.

Farming
,
wastewater
treatment
facilities
and
industrial
spills
are
cited
as
contributing
factors
to
loss
of
water
quality
.

It
also
contributes
to
the
pollution
of
the
Chesapeake

History
Boswell
was
settled
in
0000
and
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
February
00
,
0000
.

The
community
's
founder
was
Thomas
Taylor
Boswell
,
the
first
president
and
supervisor
of
the
Merchants
Coal
Company
.

Mr.
Boswell
's
company
purchased
of
mineral
rights
under
local
farmland
and
laid
out
0,000
lots
for
coal
company
houses
to
house
the
miners
for
its
new
deep
coal
mine
just
to
the
north
.

Merchants
Coal
,
and
the
related
Orenda
Coal
,
were
subsidiaries
of
Hillman
Coal
and
Coke
Company
of
Pittsburgh
,
the
same
firm
that
built
the
neighboring
town
of
Jerome
,
Pennsylvania
.

Merchants
Coal
attempted
to
build
Boswell
to
be
a
notch
above
surrounding
coal
company
towns
in
that
plans
included
a
central
business
district
,
a
high
school
,
and
homes
constructed
from
brick
,
as
opposed
to
the
wood
used
elsewhere
.

This
also
helped
to
prevent
the
spread
of
fire
,
in
the
event
that
one
would
break
out
.

Many
of
the
original
brick
homes
are
still
standing
,
with
much
of
their
original
integrity
.

A
branch
of
the
Baltimore
&
Ohio
railroad
served
Boswell
and
its
coal
mine
.

At
its
economic
peak
shortly
after
World
War
II
,
Boswell
boasted
two
movie
theatres
,
three
department
stores
,
a
bank
,
several
jewelry
stores
,
a
druggist
,
two
funeral
homes
,
three
grocery
stores
,
nearly
a
dozen
restaurants
and
taverns
,
a
lumber
yard
,
and
a
weekly
newspaper
.

Earlier
,
pre-Prohibition
,
Boswell
also
boasted
its
own
brewery
.

Boswell
's
streets
generally
run
perpendicular
to
its
avenues
,
in
a
grid
.

Many
of
the
avenues
in
Boswell
are
named
after
coal
company
officials
.

For
example
:
At
the
same
time
,
the
borough
's
street
names
can

a

lesson

the
flow
of
water
from
Boswell
to
the
seas
,
with
two
exceptions
made
for
streets
in
the
central
business
district
.

Street
names
from

The
mine
,
Orenda
Mine
#
0
,
extracted
high
quality
,
semi
-
bituminous
coal
.

A
steam
engine
hoisted
the
coal
to
the
surface
.

The
hoist
pulled
the
coal
cars
up
a
coal
tipple
that
was
long
,
high
,
and
wide
.

In
0000
,
this
was
the
largest
coal
tipple
in
the
world
.

At
its
prime
,
000
men
were
employed
and
over
0,000
tons
of
coal
were
mined
daily
.

The
company
was
eventually
renamed
to
the
United
Coal
Company
and
in
0000
it
became
the
Davis
Coal
Company
.

For
most
of
its
history
,
the
mine
at
Boswell
operated
without
union
representation
.

An
early
attempt
to
unionize
workers
led
to
an
armed
riot
on
January
00
,
0000
.

Seven
were
wounded
and
00
arrested
in
the
melee
.

A
prolonged
struggle
for
unionization
,
which
began
at
Jerome
and
Windber
in
northern
Somerset
County
in
early
April
,
0000
,
extended
to
Boswell
on
April
00
.

By
April
00
,
0000
,
miners
at
Acosta
,
Gray
,
Ralphton
,
Randolph
and
Jenners
also
joined
the
strike
,
which
was
to
last
sixteen
months
.

(

of
the
strike

Mining
disasters
There
have
been
two
noteworthy
disasters
at
the
Boswell
mines
.

A
methane
gas
explosion
killed
five
miners
in
0000
and
another
explosion
in
0000
killed
00
miners
.

Mining
at
Boswell
was
a
problem-plagued
effort
,
according
to
discussions
with
local
residents
from
the
era
.

While
much
archival
research
remains
to
be
done
corroborate
these
details
,
it
seems
apparent
that
Merchants
Coal
,
and
its
parent
which
was
eventually
known
as
Hillman
Coal
&
Coke
,
miscalculated
in
the
siting
of
Boswell
and
its
mine
.

Given
the
size
of
Merchant
's
capital
outlay
—
including
construction
in
Boswell
of
the
world
's
largest
tipple
,
a
central
business
district
and
a
high
school
—
the
company
planned
big
things
for
Boswell
.

The
town
of
Jerome
appears
to
have
been
built
as
a
satellite
town
,
soon
to
be
linked
with
Boswell
,
both
underground
in
coal
production
and
on
the
surface
in
social
and
cultural
life
(
the
right-of-way
for
a
street
car
line
was
acquired
between
Jerome
and
Boswell
,
for
instance
)
.

However
,
local
miners
tell
of
the
"
Stone
Wall
,
"
an
unexpected
and
virtually
insurmountable
underground
geological
fault
hit
midway
between
Jerome
and
Boswell
that
prevented
the
linking
of
the
two
mines
at
a
reasonable
cost
.

Evidence
of
this
fault
can
be
seen
on
the
land
surface
near
Route
000
about
two
miles
(
0
km
)
south
of
Jerome
.

(
Indeed
,
when
mechanized
deep-mining
resumed
in
this
area
for
a
time
in
the
late
00th
century
,
the
entry
shaft
was
sunk
adjacent
to
this
fault
,
presumably
so
access
could
be
had
to
the
entire
field
.
)

It
can
be
speculated
that
Hillman
had
planned
to
use
Boswell
as
its
primary
processing
facility
after
the
link-up
,
thus
the
huge
tipple
.

Hillman
also
likely
planned
to
make
Boswell
the
center
of
operations
and
community
life
(
of
evidence
,
the
high
school
)
.

But
the
two
mines
never
came
together
;
in
fact
,
Boswell
's
mine
proved
to
be
significantly
less
productive
than
Jerome
's
,
as
shown
by
documented
production
figures
from
0000
,
for
example
.

In
that
year
,
Boswell
produced
000,000
tons
of
coal
,
while
Jerome
produced
000,000
tons
,
four
times
as
much
.

The
Boswell
mine
closed
on
March
00
,
0000
,
due
to
the
excessive
cost
of
transporting
coal
to
the
surface
(
the
Jerome
mine
worked
until
0000
)
.

The
Boswell
tipple
was
dismantled
in
0000
,
though
some
of
the
tipple
's
abutments
still
stand
today
.

After
the
mine
closed
a
slow
economic
decline
set
in
.

However
,
many
businesses
survived
well
into
the
0000s
and
early
0000s
.

Railroad
freight
service
to
Boswell
stopped
in
the
early
0000s
.

Boswell
today
is
primarily
a
bedroom
community
.

In
0000
,
the
high
school
was
rechristened
as
North
Star
High
School
.

It
is
the
successor
from
the
earlier
Boswell
,
Jenner
Boswell
,
Jenner-Boswell-Jennerstown
,
and
Forbes
High
Schools
.

The
high
school
is

Drainage
from
the
Boswell
mine
was
a
primary
source
of
pollution
into
Quemahoning
Creek
,
which
flows
just
north
of

.

A
remediation
project
was
completed
in

,
spearheaded
by
SCRIP
(

&
Gun
Club
,
a
local
sportsmen
's
club
,
provided
significant
funds
to

.

The
discovery
of
the
purple
fringeless
orchid
,
an
endangered

complicated
the
project
.

History
Initial
hunters
and
settlers
in
the
territory
that
includes
present-day
Jenner
Township
were
Mingo
,
also
known
as
the
Seneca
,
one
of
the
Six
Nations
of
the
Iroquois
.

The
land
was
ceded
by
the
Iroquois
Six
Nations
officially
by
the
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
of
0000
to
Penn
family
as
proprietors
of
Pennsylvania
province
.

Early
European
traders
crossed
Jenner
Township
as
early
as
0000
,
when
Christopher
Gist
documented
his
brief
time
there
in
his
travel
diary
.

Gist
is
said
to
have
named
Quemahoning
Creek
,
which
drains
much
of
Jenner
Township
.

The
Northern
Trail
,
an
established
Indian
trail
,
crossed
the
territory
from
east
to
west
,
intersecting
Quemahoning
Creek
at
Kickenapaulin
's
Town
,
a
rather
substantial
Indian
settlement
,
the
site
of
which
now
lies
under
the
waters
of
the
Quemahoning
Reservoir
,
just
outside
the
township
.

In
August
0000
,
the
Northern
Trail
was
improved
,
initially
for
the
British
military
use
,
and
renamed
the
Forbes
Trail
,
later
known
as
the
Pennsylvania
Road
,
the
Lincoln
Highway
,
and
now
U.S.
Route
00
.

With
the
building
of
the
Forbes
Road
to
Fort
Ligonier
and
,
later
,
onward
to
Fort
Pitt
,
present-day
Pittsburgh
,
European
settlement
began
in
earnest
.

Jenner
Township
was
formed
out
of
the
western
part
of
Quemahoning
Township
in
0000
.

The
township
was
named
in
honor
of
Dr.
Edward
Jenner
,
discoverer
of
the
smallpox
vaccine
.

Early
Jenner
Township
settlers
were
primarily
German
and
English
speakers
engaged
in
agriculture
.

Pennsylvania
Dutch
was
still
spoken
in
rural
parts
of
the
township
until
the
0000s
.

Jenner
Crossroads
,
the
township
's
first
substantial
European
settlement
,
grew
near
a
grist
mill
and
tavern
stop
established
about
0000
along
the
Pennsylvania
Road
.

Samuel
Steel
built
a
sawmill
at
Jenner
Crossroads
in
0000
;
John
Shopwood
opened
a
hotel
in
0000
,
and
Samuel
Elder
opened
the
first
store
in
0000
Other
early
industry
in
the
township
included
a
sawmill
on
Quemahoning
Creek
built
about
0000
by
Moses
Fream
and
a
small
woolen
mill
,
built
in
0000
by
William
Dalley
,
enlarged
by
Owen
and
William
Morgan
later
into
a
small
settlement
known
as
Morgantown
.

Jenners
,
Ralphton
,
Acosta
and
Gray
were
each
built
shortly
after
0000
as
company
towns
by
Consolidation
Coal
,
a
Rockefeller
interest
,
for
its
newly
opened
deep
coal
mines
.

Immigrants
from
Poland
,
Italy
,
Russia
,
Ruthenia
,
Wales
,
and
Ireland
filled
the
coal
towns
.

The
Somerset
Coal
Strike
of
0000-0000
centered
in
these
towns
,
and
nearby
Boswell
,
Jerome
and
Windber
.

The
strike
,
which
ultimately
failed
in
its
goal
to
unionize
miners
,
drew
significant
nationwide
attention
for
the
hardships
suffered
by
local
miners
.

By
the
0000s
,
the
deep
mines
had
closed
.

The
town
of
Randolph
was
also
a
very
small
coal
mining
community
in
Jenner
Township
,
any
trace
of
which
is
now
virtually
gone
,
having
been
destroyed
by
highway
construction
in
0000
.

Surface
mining
and
some
deep
mining
of
coal
continues
in
the
immediate
area
.

Farming
,
timber
harvest
and
tourism
are
also
mainstays
of
the
local
economy
.

Jenner
Township
also
serves
as
a
bedroom
community
for
the
nearby
Somerset
and
Johnstown
areas
.

The
Bridge
in
Jenner
Township
and
Matthew
Hair
Farm
are
listed
on

History
Jennerstown
was
first
settled
in
the
late
00th
century
as
a
stage
coach
stop
on
the
Forbes
Road
,
one
of
the
first
roads
constructed
by
English-speaking
settlers
over
the
Allegheny
Mountains
.

The
town
,
originally
named
Laurel
Hill
,
was
later
renamed
Jennerville
in
honor
of
Dr.
Edward
Jenner
,
discoverer
of
the
smallpox
vaccine
.

Later
,
Jennerville
became
Jennerstown
.

The
town
and
vicinity
boast
several
buildings
about
000
years
old
,
which
is
not
common
in
the
surrounding
area
.

Throughout
its
history
,
Jennerstown
has
served
primarily
as
a
wayside
for
travelers
and
as
a
farming
community
.

Its
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
initially
under
the
name
of
Laurel
Hill
.

The
village
contained
seven
or
eight
houses
,
a
store
and
a
tavern
at
that
time
.

Jennerstown
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

Jennerstown
has
never
been
a
large
town
,
and
its
current
population
represents
a
peak
.

Jennerstown
is
home
to
the
Mountain
Playhouse
,
one
of
the
oldest
venues
for
summer
stock
theatre
in
the
United

Playhouse
has
maintained
a

theatre
productions
nightly
from
May
through

History
Jerome
was
built
in
0000
as
a
company
town
for
what
became
the
Hillman
Coal
&
Coke
Company
of
Pittsburgh
,
and
named
for
Jerome
Coulson
,
the
son
of
a
coal
company
official
.

The
town
filled
mostly
with
immigrants
from
Croatia
,
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Russia
and
Italy
—
particularly
Italians
from
the
Alpine
province
of
Trentino
and
the
town
of
San
Lorenzo
in
Banale
(
part
of
the
Dolomiti
di
Brenta
area
)
[
0
]
[
0
]
—
in
addition
to
local
Scots-Irish
,
Welsh
and
German
stock
.

Jerome
was
the
largest
single
coal
mine
in
the
Cambria-Somerset
district
.

Jerome
's
wood
frame
houses
were
primarily
of
two
designs
—
two-story
semi-detached
houses
and
smaller
single-family
cottages
.

Most
of
these
initial
dwellings
still
stand
today
.

These
houses
,
especially
in
the
period
before
0000
,
typically
were
surrounded
by
large
vegetable
gardens
,
fruit
trees
and
grape
arbors
.

Homemade
wine
was
a
local
specialty
.

At
its
economic
peak
,
Jerome
boasted
a
000-seat
movie
theatre
,
a
bank
,
a
hotel
,
an
auto
dealership
,
several
dry
goods
and
grocery
stores
,
several
taverns
,
an
electrical
appliance
store
,
a
YMCA
,
and
a
bowling
alley
.

A
local
tavern
maintained
a
popular
bocce
court
.

The
mine
employed
over
0000
men
.

Residents
from
that
period
claim
Jerome
's
population
stood
at
about
0,000
at
its
peak
,
although
this
information
is
yet
to
be
documented
.

However
,
Jerome
's
population
certainly
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
capital
investment
to
tie
the
town
into
the
interurban
transit
system
.

Electric
streetcar
service
from
Jerome
to
the
nearby
city
of
Johnstown
was
proposed
as
early
as
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
project
was
financed
through
a
public
bond
offering
,
construction
completed
and
service
began
.

The
streetcar
tram
left
from
the
Jerome
terminus
every
two
hours
for
the
00
minute
trip
that
ended
on
downtown
Johnstown
's
Main
Street
.

Property
right-of-way
was
obtained
to
extend
this
tram
service
to
the
south
to
Boswell
,
Jenners
,
Somerset
and
Rockwood
,
although
track
construction
never
commenced
.

Service
to
Johnstown
ended
in
0000
.

Separately
,
a
branch
line
of
the
Baltimore
&
Ohio
Railroad
served
Jerome
and
its
coal
mine
,
connecting
to
the
B&O
trunk
line
at
Hollsopple
.

An
underground
explosion
killed
two
miners
instantly
and
two
later
from
burns
received
at
the
Jerome
mine
on
July
00
,
0000
,
the
single
largest
accident
in
the
mine
's
history
uncovered
in
research
to
date
.

The
coal
mine
closed
in
the
0000
.

Jerome
rapidly
became
a
bedroom
community
.

The
town
retained
much
of
its
close-knit
ethnic
character
and
its
spirit
well
into
the
0000s
,
however
.

As
an
example
,
the
Jerome
Volunteer
Fire
Department
was
founded
in
0000
with
Steve
Gironda
as
its
first
president
.

The
Volunteer
Fire
Department
remains
today
as
an
anchor
of
community
activity
.

In
0000
,
the
Dorfman
and
Hoffman
Company
established
a
garment
factory
in
the
former
Hillman
company
store
building
,
bringing
000
needed
jobs
to
Jerome
.

The
factory
continued
operation
until
0000
.

A
lumber
mill
operated
out
of
former
mining-operations
buildings
in
the
0000s
.

A
wind-whipped
fire
destroyed
the
lumber
mill
in
0000
,
and
remaining
mining
buildings
were
demolished
subsequently
.

National
Football
League
quarterback
Jeff
Hostetler
(
career
0000-0000
)
grew
up
on
a
farm
just
outside
Jerome
.

Hostetler
led
the
New
York
Giants
to
their
00-00
win
over
the
Buffalo
Bills
in
Super
Bowl
XXV
(

.

Jerome
native
Brian
Ferrari
qualified
for
the
0000
U.S.

Marathon
Trials
.

Ferrari
also
holds
two
NCAA
Division
II
championships
in

meters
and
one
national
cross-country
championship
.

In
0000
,
Jerome
natives
Dick
Trachok
and
Tommy
Kalmanir
each
were
inducted
into
the
University
of
Nevada
,
Reno
's
football
Team
of
Century
.

Kalminer
played
in
Nevada
's
backfield
,
0000
–

and
later
played
for
the
Los
Angeles
Rams
and
Baltimore
Colts
.

Trachock
was
a
top
running
back
at
Nevada
and
later
served
as
Nevada
's
head
football
coach
(
0000

and
athletic
director
(

.

Jerome
's
Tony
Venzon
(
0000

was
a
baseball
umpire
for
the
National

0000-0000
,
including
the
0000
,
0000
and
0000

.

Jazz
clarinetist
,
band
leader
and
composer
Ted
Lach
(
0000
–

)
was
a
native
of
Jerome
.

The
miners
'
strike
of
0000-0000
Jerome
was
the
scene
of
several
unionization
efforts
by
the
United
Mine
Workers
Union
.

An
important
and
the
longest
of
these
efforts
was
the
strike
that
began
on
Good
Friday
morning
,
April
00
,
0000
,
led
by
local
miner
George
Gregory
,
with
the
assistance
of
outside
union
supporters
.

Rumors
of
strikes
at
non-union
mines
,
such
as
Jerome
at
that
time
,
had
been
circulating
for
several
weeks
.

Indeed
the
General
Policy
Committee
of
the
United
Mine
Workers
Union
issued
a
call
on
March
00
for
the
nation
's
000,000
non-union
miners
to
join
a
planned
nationwide
strike
on
April
0
,
to
coincide
with
the
expiration
of
the
current
union
contract
.

Organizers
slid
past
armed
company
police
to
circulate
pamphlets
and
leaflets
,
as
seen
here
and
here
,
to
encourage
the
miners
'
walk
out
.

Hillman
Coal
's
viewpoint
For
its
part
,
Hillman
Coal
and
Coke
believed
it
provided
a
willful
benevolence
within
Jerome
and
Boswell
,
its
two
coal
towns
in
Somerset
County
,
although
miners
under
Hillman
tutelage
disagreed
,
as
the
strike
would
show
.

To
be
sure
,
Hillman
ran
these
towns
with
an
iron
fist
;
simply
to
enter
Jerome
by
car
required
inspection
by
a
gauntlet
of
armed
private
police
,
for
instance
.

But
Hillman
also
built
Boswell
with
a
number
of
extra
amenities
,
such
as
a
high
school
,
central
business
district
,
and
brick
construction
for
its
patch
housing
.

And
in
Jerome
,
the
Company
built
a
community
center
including
a
YMCA
,
pool
hall
,
bowling
alley
,
butchery
,
green
grocer
,
theater
,
and
post
office
,
in
addition
to
the
Hillman
Supply
Company
store
.

In
October
,
0000
Hillman
established
the
First
National
Bank
of
Jerome
for
its
workers
.

It
allowed
for
the
construction
of
a
streetcar
line
from
Johnstown
in
0000
(
as
noted
above
)
,
which
made
travel
easier
and
more
frequent
than
could
be
provided
by
railroad
.

Hillman
even
engaged
in
a
significant
capital
re-investment
at
Jerome
,
rebuilding
a
brick
new
community
center
after
the
initial
structure
was
destroyed
in
a
spectacular
,
wind-driven
fire
on
April
0
,
0000
.

However
,
demand
for
coal
nationwide
dropped
precipitously
and
continually
in
the
several
years
after
World
War
I.
In
a
response
,
Hillman
closed
its
mines
at
Ella
and
Patterson
,
Allegheny
County
,
and
at
Naomi
,
Fayette
County
,
but
maintained
production
at
Boswell
and
Jerome
.

By
mid
0000
,
the
Company
told
its
shareholders
in
its
Annual
Report
,
“
…
the
demand
[
for
coal
]
became
so
small
and
the
competition
from
non-union
fields
so
severe
that
it
was
evident
that
the
non-union
mines
of
your
Company
could
not
continue
to
operate
unless
wages
were
readjusted
.

As
a
result
of
this
condition
,
wages
were
reduced
…
at
your
Jerome
Mines
on
July
00
,
0000
.

”
Hillman
continued
that
the
reduction
allowed
the
Jerome
mine
to
operate
“
on
a
competitive
basis
”
and
“
with
regularity
,
”
with
the
result
being
that
“
earnings
of
the
men
at
your
non-union
mines
for
the
year
0000
are
far
in
excess
of
those
received
by
men
at
union
mines
…
.

”
,
who
,
Hillman
implied
,
suffered
frequent
short-term
furloughs
as
the
result
of
slack
demand
.

Hillman
told
its
shareholders
that
,
prior
to
the
pay
cut
,
“
men
working
by
day
were
being
paid
$
0.00
for
eight
hours
work
,
and
men
working
by
the
ton
were
able
to
earn
$
00.00
to
$
00.00
per
day
.

”
(
Note
that
these
wages
reported
by
Hillman
to
its
stockholders
were
flatly
contradicted
by
other
reportage
,
for
instance
,
Blankenhorn
maintained
that
union
gross
wages
in
0000
more
typically
ranged
from
$
00.00
to
$
00.00
per
week
,
and
after
deductions
for
goods
purchased
through
company
stores
,
a
typical
miner
's
weekly
net
take-home
pay
often
was
less
than
$
0.00
.
)

On
all
its
coal
operations
,
including
Jerome
and
Boswell
,
Hillman
Coal
and
Coke
reported
an
operating
profit
of
approximately
$
000,000
,
on
revenues
of
$
0.000
million
in
0000
,
and
an
operating
profit
of
approximately
$
000,000
,
on
revenues
of
$
0.000
million
in
0000
.

But
Jerome
was
seething
.

Hillman
Coal
&
Coke
cut
miners
'
wages
a
second
time
during
the
deflation
of
0000
and
working
conditions
remained
hard
and
strict
,
to
miners
'
perception
.

Additionally
,
mine
owners
had
recently
ceased
payment
and
expected
miners
to
do
for
no
pay
"
dead
work
"
,
which
was
the
removal
of
non-bituminous
soils
,
slate
and
rubbish
from
the
mines
.

Gregory
and
local
miners
held
several
secret
pre-strike
rallies
at
the
"
Sokolniapolskawjerom
"
,
the
Jerome
Polish
Falcons
Hall
,
although
one
wonders
how
secret
they
were
,
given
over
000
men
attended
one
meeting
.

Sensing
trouble
,
Hillman
suddenly
increased
its
armed
guard
patrolling
the
town
at
the
end
of
March
,
0000
.

Hillman
police
also
were
stopping
all
autos
before
entering
Jerome
.

Scattered
walkouts
began
at
smaller
non-union
mines
—
in
St.
Michael
,
Cambria
County
,
a
partial
strike
began
April
0
and
gained
momentum
through
April
0
,
and
at
Mine
00
,
near
Windber
,
Somerset
County
,
a
walk-out
on
April
0
.

Powers
Hapgood
and
his
work
On
April
00
,
John
Brophy
,
president
of
United
Mine
Workers
Union
District
0
,
asked
Powers
Hapgood
,
a
00-year-old
Harvard
graduate
,
who
had
given
up
his
silver
spoon
to
live
and
work
as
a
miner
,
if
he
would
volunteer
to
help
organize
Somerset
County
non-union
mines
.

Hapgood
began
at
Jerome
and
Boswell
.

The
gentle-looking
Hapgood
,
nephew
of
the
U.S.
’s
ambassador
to
Denmark
,
at
first
evoked
much
derision
among
some
Union
officials
,
although
apparently
not
among
miners
,
with
whom
he
worked
shoulder-to-shoulder
deep
in
the
mines
.

Four
decades
later
,
Brophy
wrote
of
Hapgood
,
"
He
was
sincere
,
friendly
,
and
courageous
to
the
point
of
foolhardiness
.

By
that
I
mean
that
he
would
sometimes
drive
ahead
in
a
situation
without
considering
sufficiently
what
he
was
up
against
.

As
a
result
,
he
got
some
pretty
hard
knocks
at
times
.
"

In
Jerome
,
Hapgood
linked
up
with
Gregory
.

While
more
acquainted
with
the
rough-and-tumble
than
was
Hapgood
initially
,
Gregory
himself
—
who
went
by
the
nickname
"
Praying
George
,
"
because
of
his
frequent
and
vocal
prayers
during
workers
'
rallies
—
was
a
strict
teetotaler
,
who
had
been
deputized
by
the
local
sheriff
for
a
Prohibition
squad
.

In
idealism
and
social
vision
,
Gregory
and
Hapgood
were
kindred
spirits
.

The
two
became
lifelong
friends
.

In
addition
to
direct
work
as
a
miner
,
Hapgood
relied
on
three
approaches
to
organize
the
Somerset
coalfields
–
civil
disobedience
,
litigation
and
publicity
.

First
,
in
pioneering
methods
evocative
later
of
Mohandas
Gandhi
and
Martin
Luther
King
,
Hapgood
depended
heavily
on
peaceful
,
civil
disobedience
.

Coal
towns
were
the
wholly
owned
,
private
property
of
corporations
at
the
time
,
and
so
,
in
the
eyes
of
these
companies
,
simply
walking
the
street
uninvited
was
deemed
to
be
trespassing
.

Hapgood
in
Somerset
County
was
arrested
more
than
a
dozen
times
on
the
picket
line
and
at
the
head
of
marches
,
as
the
strike
unfolded
.

(
Hapgood
,
Gregory
and
other
also
took
picketing
directly
to
various
corporate
headquarters
on
Wall
Street
,
where
they
did
not
invite
arrest
but
achieve
considerable
positive
publicity
and
access
.
)

Hapgood
’s
arrests
then
gave
him
venue
to
the
judicial
system
,
where
Hapgood
insisted
on
his
–
and
the
miners
’
–
procedural
and
Constitutional
rights
.

Indeed
,
an
important
part
of
the
Somerset
County
coal
strike
played
out
in
the
courtroom
of
Somerset
County
Judge
John
Berkey
,
where
mine
owners
sometimes
,
but
not
always
,
prevailed
under
Judge
Berkey
’s
often
even-handed
rulings
.

Hapgood
,
as
the
strike
continued
,
then
made
sure
that
the
plight
of
Somerset
County
miners
remained
front-page
news
across
the
United
States
.

From
the
strike
's
beginning
,
Hapgood
,
Brophy
,
Gregory
and
other
union
leaders
understood
the
powerful
role
public
opinion
could
play
;
the
men
engaged
in
what
,
even
by
today
’s
best
practices
,
would
be
seen
as
a
sophisticated
public
relations
program
.

In
New
York
City
,
the
program
sparked
sympathetic
press
coverage
,
generally
effective
public
affairs
,
the
intervention
by
the
Mayor
of
New
York
on
the
miners
'
side
,
direct
public
appeals
in
the
subways
,
and
even
the
support
of
mine
owners
,
such
as
John
D.
Rockefeller
,
Jr.
,
whose
family
owned
strike-bound
Somerset
County
coal
mines
in
Gray
,
Jenners
,
Acosta
,
Ralphton
and
Randolph
.

Gregory
and
other
miners
later
traveled
to
Washington
to
meet
with
President
Warren
G.
Harding
.

The
strike
at
Jerome
begins
On
April
00
,
Jerome
miners
dressed
for
work
and
gathered
at
the
shaft
head
,
but
refused
to
enter
the
mine
.

Blankenhorn
,
in
his
history
of
the
strike
,
wrote
,
"
The
super
began
a
conciliatory
speech
of
promises
of
good
treatment
,
'
What
's
the
good
of
that
?

We
've
heard
that
bull
for
ten
years
,
'
cried
Gregory
.....
'
If
you
do
n't
go
to
work
,
I
'll
shut
down
this
mine
till
the
grass
grows
over
the
drift
mouth
,
'
[
the
super
responded
]
....
A
boy
miner
,
DiGiancomo
,
shouted
back
,
'
I
'll
eat
that
grass
before
I
'll
scab
.
"

And
the
strike
was
on
.

The
men
marched
through
Jerome
,
with
an
accordion
player
in
the
lead
,
to
a
mass-rally
that
was
still
going
strong
when
union
organizers
arrived
around
noontime
.

The
mine
owners
were
thunderstruck
;
never
before
had
they
been
hit
by
a
successful
universal
rebellion
against
their
rule
.

The
Jerome
action
lit
the
fuse
;
the
strike
spread
to
non-union
mines
in
Hiyasota
,
Kelso
,
Boswell
,
Jenners
,
Listie
,
Acosta
,
Gray
and
elsewhere
the
next
days
;
within
one
week
a
regional
non-union
coal
work
stoppage
was
in
full
force
.

The
Jerome
strike
was
significant
in
that
it
was
among
the
first
and
the
largest
non-union
site
in
the
region
to
join
in
the
nationwide
strike
called
by
the
United
Mine
Workers
Union
,
thus
provided
tipping-point
momentum
for
the
strike
,
or
as
Blankenhorn
expressed
it
in
his
book
's
table
of
contents
,
"
Jerome
's
Explosion
.
"

The
0000
strike
became
the
largest
action
in
United
Mine
Workers
Union
history
;
at
its
peak
more
than
000,000
union
and
non-union
miners
,
in
the
bituminous
and
anthracite
fields
,
had
walked
off
their
jobs
.

Jerome
was
turned
into
an
occupied
camp
by
a
strike
that
lasted
sixteen
months
.

By
mid-May
0000
,
for
instance
,
00
Somerset
County
sheriff
's
deputies
patrolled
Jerome
,
along
side
a
much
larger
contingent
of
company
police
and
a
unit
of
the
Pennsylvania
State
police
.

The
State
Militia
arrived
a
few
months
later
.

During
this
period
,
Hillman
Coal
systematically
began
to
evict
miner
families
from
company-owned
housing
.

According
to
Hillman
records
,
quoted
by
Blankenhorn
,
000
families
in
Jerome
were
set
out
into
the
street
,
about
one-third
of
Hillman
employment
at
the
mine
at
the
time
.

A
'
tent
city
'
was
established
for
homeless
strikers
and
their
families
on
the
nearby
lands
of
sympathetic
farmers
.

These
evictions
here
and
elsewhere
in
Somerset
County
sparked
an
unusual
swell
of
public
sympathy
.

A
commission
appointed
by
the
Mayor
of
New
York
City
,
which
got
its
coal
to
run
subways
from
various
Somerset
County
coal
mines
,
found
"
hundreds
of
strikers
evicted
and
suffering
from
the
cold
"
,
"
saw
in
tents
,
hen-houses
,
stables
and
other
improvised
homes
women
and
children
whose
feet
were
bare
and
bleeding
"
and
declared
that
living
and
working
conditions
"
were
worse
than
the
conditions
of
slaves
prior
to
the
Civil
War
.
"

John
D.
Rockefeller
,
Jr.
,
whose
family
owned
several
Somerset
County
coal
mines
,
but
not
Jerome
's
,
wrote
,
"
I
believe
that
the
underlying
grievances
of
the
miners
in
this
district
are
well
founded
,
and
I
have
urged
with
all
the
sincerity
and
vigor
at
my
command
that
the
present
labor
policy
of
the
operators
,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
both
unwise
and
unjust
,
be
radically
altered
.
"

The
strike
held
together
,
despite
its
length
and
brutality
;
the
Company
said
later
that
,
of
the
approximately
000
miners
on
strike
at
its
beginning
,
only
about
000
broke
ranks
and
returned
to
work
early
.

In
the
last
days
of
the
strike
in
0000
,
a
number
of
buildings
,
railroad
bridges
and
other
property
were
destroyed
by
dynamite
in
acts
of
sabotage
.

A
gunpowder
or
dynamite
blast
destroyed
a
shelter
for
homeless
striking
families
.

Dynamite
destroyed
a
000-foot
steel
railroad
bridge
spanning
the
Stonycreek
River
near
Jerome
on
July
00
,
0000
.

Somerset
County
Sheriff
J.W.
Griffith
told
writer
Blankenhorn
that
both
strikers
and
company
employees
held
responsibility
for
explosions
.
"

There
are
guards
who
want
to
keep
their
jobs
going
and
strikers
who
have
been
making
threats
,
"
Sheriff
Griffith
said
.

Results
of
the
strike
at
Jerome
While
the
strike
caused
significant
hardship
,
and
even
decayed
into
violence
frequently
from
both
sides
,
not
all
was
grim
.

Blankenhorn
,
who
was
a
writer
for
the
magazine
"
The
Nation
"
,
relayed
the
adventure
of
one
young
student
and
union
organizer
from
Pittsburgh
,
named
Viscosky
,
who
convinced
Hillman
to
hire
him
as
a
guard
just
prior
to
the
strike
.

Blackenhorn
wrote
,
Viscosky
"
used
his
very
special
opportunity
to
line
them
[
the
miners
]
up
for
a
strike
.

The
only
man
whom
he
reported
to
the
company
was
one
who
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
'
union
,
'
the
company
faithfully
discharged
that
one
.
"

Later
,
when
Viscosky
thought
it
prudent
to
disappear
from
Jerome
before
Hillman
caught
on
,
he
convinced
police
officials
to
give
him
a
free
conduct
pass
through
checkpoints
,
"
so
he
could
visit
his
sister
in
Jenners
.
"

In
August
0000
,
union
miners
agreed
to
a
new
contract
that
did
not
include
non-union
miners
.

The
miners
at
Jerome
and
other
Somerset
County
mines
,
left
out
of
the
contract
,
continued
on
for
another
twelve
months
,
agreeing
on
August
00
,
0000
,
to
return
to
work
finally
having
been
exhausted
by
a
process
that
,
for
them
,
produced
little
economic
benefit
immediately
.

At
Jerome
,
Hillman
Coal
offered
a
general
amnesty
to
most
miners
,
if
each
returned
to
work
as
an
individual
and
not
as
part
of
a
union
local
.

Nevertheless
,
the
solid
front
displayed
by
Jerome
miners
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
mine
's
eventual
unionization
in
the
0000s
.

Further
,
as
Hapgood
,
Blankenhorn
,
Beik
and
others
point
out
,
the
miners
themselves
felt
the
0000-00
strike
to
be
a
victory
.

Prior
to
the
strike
,
miners
felt
atomized
,
helpless
and
hopeless
;
the
coal
towns
of
Somerset
County
were
"
visibly
split
"
by
ethnic
divisions
"
admittedly
...
fostered
by
the
coal
companies
"
as
a
means
of
social
control
.
"

[
C
]
oal
mining
families
....
[
lived
]
within
a
social
,
economic
and
political
system
of
profound
autocracy
thinly
veiled
by
shallow
,
pragmatic
paternalism
.
"

After
the
strike
,
Jerome
emerged
with
the
beginnings
of
an
increasingly
strong
,
tolerant
social
fabric
,
which
remained
tight-knit
for
several
generations
and
still
provides
important
unifying
elements
today
.

Environmental
impact
of
coal
mining
activities
at
Jerome
The
semi-bituminous
coal
bed
at
Jerome
,
part
of
the
Upper
Kittanning
formation
,
was
approximately
six
feet
thick
,
capped
by
shale
and
limestone
,
with
a
smooth
,
hard
sandstone
floor
.

In
0000
,
the
mine
had
a
capacity
of
0,000
tons
a
day
,
with
an
average
daily
output
of
0,000
tons
.

The
tipple
had
four
loading
tracks
with
a
capacity
of
00
cars
.

Within
the
tipple
,
coal
was
cleaned
first
by
machine
through
shaker
screens
,
then
by
hand
,
along
a
conveyor
and
at
loading
.

Refuse
coal
and
rock
was
dumped
in
a
hillside
to
the
south
of
the
tipple
.

For
the
first
00-some
years
of
its
history
,
Jerome
's
landscape
was
dominated
by
this
black
,
man-made
mountain
of
coal
mining
wastes
.

The
"
bony
pile
,
"
as
it
was
called
,
loomed
from
the
hillside
south
of
Penn
Avenue
and
east
of
Cross
and
Fifth
Avenues
.

Only
a
few
plant
species
were
hardy
enough
to
survive
the
hot
,
dry
,
nutrient-deficient
conditions
on
the
pile
.

Heavy
metals
,
including
arsenic
and
mercury
,
leached
from
the
pile
into
the
immediately
adjacent
area
.

The
pile
was
removed
in
the
0000s
,
when
local
electric
generating
stations
found
cost-effective
ways
to
render
additional
coal
out
of
the
pile
.

A
much
smaller
scar
remains
on
the
hillside
,
which
can
be
seen
as
the
bare
spot
,
center
in
the
photo
here
.

A
photo
of
a
typical
western
Pennsylvania
bony
pile
can
be
seen
here
.

While
the
bony
pile
in
this
photo
is
believed
not
to
be
Jerome
's
,
the
bony
pile
in
Jerome
looked
remarkably
similar
.

Most
water
runoff
from
the
Jerome
mine
emptied
into
the
South
Fork
of
Bens
Creek
at
Thomas
Mills
.

Bens
Creek
formerly
was
a
robust
trout
habitat
.

Mine
effluent
contained
high
concentrations
of
iron
,
which
rendered
downstream
sections
of
Bens
Creek
effectively
sterile
from
about
0000
to
0000
.

A
remediation
project
(
construction
0000-0000
,
re-engineered
0000
)
coordinated
by
the
Stonycreek-Conemaugh
River
Improvement
Project
(
SCRIP
)
,
a
local
non-governmental
organization
,
restored
Bens
Creek
by
precipitating
iron
toxins
from
the
effluent
.

The
Bens
Creek
project
,
also
known
as
the
Rock
Tunnel
Project
is
home
to
SCRIP
's
first
mine
drainage
effort
(
see
facts
sheet
on
Bens
Creek
)
.

SCRIP
subsequently
went
on
to
restore
other
creeks
and
rivers
in
Somerset
and
Cambria
Counties
.

Supplemental
to
the
efforts
of
SCRIP
,
the
Mountain
Laurel
Chapter
of
Trout
Unlimited
,
a
non-governmental
organization
,
completed
a
substantial
habitat
improvement
project
[
0
]
aimed
at
increasing
the
number
of
fish
that
Bens
Creek
can
hold
.

Bens
Creek
today
again
contains
brook
,
brown
and
rainbow
trout
.

Some
of
these
fish
are
stocked
while
wild
species
can
be
found
in
headwaters
.

Jerome
's
churches
For
much
of
its
history
,
Jerome
’s
social
life
revolved
around
its

Transportation
New
Baltimore
is
just
north
of
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
(
Interstates
00
and
Interstate
00
)
but
it
has
no
interchange
,
it
is
also
accessed
via
U.S.
00
(
Lincoln
Highway
)
.

Church
of
the
Turnpike
New
Baltimore
is
perhaps
best
known
for
being
home
to
the
St.
John
's
Church
,
a
Carmelite
church
located
on
the
southern
end
of
town
.

The
church
is
unique
in
that
it
has
two
sets
of
steps
along
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
at
milepost
000
,
one
set
of
each
side
of
the
highway
.

(
The
church
itself
is
located
on
the
eastbound
side
of
the
highway
.
)

The
steps
dated
from
when
the
Turnpike
first
opened
,
as
part
of
an
informal
,
unwritten
pact
between
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
Commission
and
the
church
after
St.
John
's
Church
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
New
Baltimore
due
to
the
Turnpike
passing
through
the
highway
.

In
addition
,
Carmelite
priests
were
buried
on
the
right-of-way
of
the
Turnpike
,
and
their
graves
had
to
be
moved
.

The
steps
have
long
been
a
novelty
of
the
Turnpike
and
to
curious
travelers
who
have
stopped
along
the
Turnpike
just
to
stop
at
the
church
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
the
PTC
announced
that
it
would
eventually
remove
the
steps
that
lead
to
the
St.
John
's
Church
.

The
steps
are
primarily
being
removed
due
to
a
widening
project
for
the
Turnpike
.

While
a
written
pact
has
not
been
found
by
either
the
church
or
the
PTC
,
even
if
a
written
pact
were
to
be
found
,
the
Turnpike
is
forbidden
by
federal
regulations
to
replace
the
steps
in
any
case
due
to
safety
concerns
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
the
PTC
build
an
interchange
at
New
Baltimore
as
a
compromise
,
since
it
is
around
the
halfway
point
of
a
00-mile
stretch
between
the
Somerset
and
Bedford
interchanges
and
would
help
break
the
monotony
between
interchanges
,
however
the
PTC
has
no
plans
for
an
interchange
in
the
area
.

The
steps
were
slated
to
be
removed
in
0000
,
however
as
of
February
0000
the
steps
are
still
in
place
.

A
convent
is
either
a
community
of
priest
s
,
religious
brothers
,
religious
sisters
,
or
nun
s
,
or
the
building
used
by
the
community
,
particularly
in
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
and
in
the
Anglican
Communion
.

The
terms
"
convent
"
or
"
nunnery
"
almost
invariably
refers
to
a
community
of
women
in
modern
English
usage
(
from
00th
century
)
,
while
"
monastery
"
,
"
priory
"
or
"
friary
"
is
used
for
men
;
but
in
historical
usage
they
are
often
interchangeable
.

Technically
,
a
"
monastery
"
or
"
nunnery
"
is
a
community
of
monastics
,
whereas
a
"
convent
"
is
a
community
of
mendicants
(
"
friary
"
specifying
a
male
community
specifically
)
,
and
a
"
canonry
"
a
community
of
canons
regular
.

The
terms
"
abbey
"
and
"
priory
"
can
be
applied
to
both
monasteries
and
canonries
and
distinguish
those
headed
by
an
Abbot
from
the
lesser
dependent
houses
headed
by
a
Prior
.

frequently
accompanied
them
on
the
piano
.

The
act
's
success
earned
them
a
movie
offer
and
the
Revuers
traveled
west
in
hopes
of
finding
fame
in
Greenwich
Village
,
a
0000
movie
starring
Carmen
Miranda
and
Don
Ameche
,
but
their
roles
were
so
small
they
barely
were
noticed
,
and
they
quickly
returned
to
New
York
.

Their
first
Broadway
effort
joined
them
with
Bernstein
for
On
the
Town
,
a
musical
romp
about
three
sailors
on
leave
in
New
York
City
that
was
an
expansion
of
a
ballet
entitled
Fancy
Free
on
which
Bernstein
had
been
working
with
choreographer
Jerome
Robbins
.

Comden
and
Green
wrote
the
lyrics
and
book
,
which
included
sizeable
parts
for
themselves
.

Their
next
two
musicals
,
Billion
Dollar
Baby
(
0000
)
and
Bonanza
Bound
(
0000
)
were
not
successful
,
and
once
again
they
headed
to
California
,
where
they
immediately
found
work
at
MGM
.

They
wrote
the
screenplay
for
Good
News
,
starring
June
Allyson
and
Peter
Lawford
,
The
Barkleys
of
Broadway
for
Ginger
Rogers
and
Fred
Astaire
,
and
then
adapted
On
the
Town
for
Frank
Sinatra
and
Gene
Kelly
,
scrapping
much
of
Bernstein
's
music
at
the
request
of
Arthur
Freed
,
who
did
not
care
for
the
Bernstein
score
.

They
reunited
with
Kelly
for
their
most
successful
project
,
the
classic
Singin
'
in
the
Rain
,
about
Hollywood
in
the
final
days
of
the
silent
film
era
.

Considered
by
many
film
historians
to
be
the
best
movie
musical
of
all
time
,
it
ranked
#
00
on
the
list
of
the
000
Best
American
Movies
of
the
00th
Century
,
compiled
by
the
American
Film
Institute
in
0000
.

They
followed
this
with
another
hit
,
The
Band
Wagon
,
in
which
the
characters
of
Lester
and
Lily
,
a
husband-and-wife
team
that
writes
the
screenplay
for
the
show-within-a-show
,
were
patterned
after
themselves
.

They
were
Oscar
-
nominated
twice
,
for
their
screenplays
for
The
Band
Wagon
and
It
's
Always
Fair
Weather
,
both
of
which
earned
them
a
Screen
Writers
Guild
Award
,
as
did
On
the
Town
.

Their
stage
work
during
the
next
few
years
included
the
revue
Two
on
the
Aisle
,
starring
Bert
Lahr
and
Dolores
Gray
,
Wonderful
Town
,
an
adaptation
of
the
comedy
hit
My
Sister
Eileen
,
with
Rosalind
Russell
and
Edie
Adams
as
two
sisters
from
Ohio
trying
to
make
it
in
the
Big
Apple
,
and
Bells
Are
Ringing
,
which
reunited
them
with
Judy
Holliday
as
an
operator
at
a
telephone
answering
service
.

The
score
,
including
the
standards
"
Just
in
Time
"
,
"
Long
Before
I
Knew
You
,
"
and
"
The
Party
’s
Over
,
"
proved
to
be
one
of
their
richest
.

In
0000
,
they
appeared
on
Broadway
in
A
Party
with
Betty
Comden
and
Adolph
Green
,
a
revue
that
included
some
of
their
early
sketches
.

It
was
a
critical
and
commercial
success
,
and
they
brought
an
updated
version
back
to
Broadway
in
0000
.

Among
their
other
credits
are
the
Mary
Martin
version
of

The
word
oyster
is
used
as
a
common
name
for
a
number
of
distinct
groups
of
bivalve
mollusc
s
which
live
in
marine
or
brackish
habitats
.

The
valves
are
highly
calcified
.

Some
kinds
of
oysters
are
commonly
consumed
,
cooked
or
raw
,
by
humans
as
a
delicacy
.

Other
kinds
,
such
as
pearl
oyster
s
,
generally
not
eaten
by
humans
,
are
harvested
for
the
pearl
produced
within
the
mantle
.

Etymology
First
attested
in
English
00th
century
,
the
word
"
oyster
"
comes
from
Old
French
oistre
,
in
turn
from
Latin
ostrea
,
the
feminine
form
of
ostreum
,
which
is
the
latinisation
of
the
Greek
ὄστρεον
(
ostreon
)
,
"
oyster
"
.

Compare
ὀστέον
(
osteon
)
,
"
bone
"
.

Types
True
oysters
True
oyster
s
are
members
of
the
family
Ostreidae
.

This
family
includes
the
edible
oysters
,
which
mainly
belong
to
the
genera
Ostrea
,
Crassostrea
,
Ostreola
,
and
Saccostrea
.

Examples
include
the
Belon
oyster
,
eastern
oyster
,
Olympia
oyster
,
Pacific
oyster
,
and
the
Sydney
rock
oyster
.

Pearl
oysters
Almost
all
shell-bearing
mollusks
can
secrete
pearls
,
yet
most
are
not
very
valuable
.

Pearl
oyster
s
are
not
closely
related
to
true
oysters
,
being
members
of
a
distinct
family
,
the
feathered
oysters
(
Pteriidae
)
.

Both
cultured
pearl
s
and
natural
pearl
s
can
be
obtained
from
pearl
oysters
,
though
other
molluscs
,
such
as
the
freshwater
mussel
s
,
also
yield
pearls
of
commercial
value
.

The
largest
pearl-bearing
oyster
is
the
marine
Pinctada
maxima
,
which
is
roughly
the
size
of
a
dinner
plate
.

Not
all
individual
oysters
produce
pearls
naturally
.

In
fact
,
in
a
harvest
of
three
ton
s
of
oysters
,
only
three
to
four
oysters
produce
perfect
pearls
.

In
nature
,
pearl
oysters
produce
natural
pearls
by
covering
a
minute
invading
parasite
with
nacre
,
not
by
ingesting
a
grain
of
sand
.

Over
the
years
,
the
irritating
object
is
covered
with
enough
layers
of
nacre
to
become
a
pearl
.

The
many
different
types
,
colours
and
shapes
of
pearls
depend
on
the
natural
pigment
of
the
nacre
,
and
the
shape
of
the
original
irritant
.

Pearl
farmers
can
culture
a
pearl
by
placing
a
nucleus
,
usually
a
piece
of
polished
mussel
shell
,
inside
the
oyster
.

In
three
to
six
years
,
the
oyster
can
produce
a
perfect
pearl
.

These
pearls
are
not
as
valuable
as
natural
pearls
,
but
look
exactly
the
same
.

In
fact
,
since
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
,
when
several
researchers
discovered
how
to
produce
artificial
pearls
,
the
cultured
pearl
market
has
far
outgrown
the
natural
pearl
market

Other
types
of
oysters
A
number
of
bivalve
molluscs
(
other
than
edible
oysters
and
pearl
oysters
)
also
have
common
names
that
include
the
word
"
oyster
"
,
usually
because
they
either
taste
or
look
like
oysters
,
or
because
they
yield
noticeable
pearls
.

Anatomy
Oysters
are
filter
feeder
s
,
drawing
water
in
over
their
gill
s
through
the
beating
of
cilia
.

Suspended
plankton
and
particles
are
trapped
in
the
mucus
of
a
gill
,
and
from
there
are
transported
to
the
mouth
,
where
they
are
eaten
,
digested
,
and
expelled
as
feces
or
pseudofaeces
.

Oysters
feed
most
actively
at
temperatures
above
00
°
C
(
00
°
F
)
.

An
oyster
can
filter
up
to
of
water
per
hour
.

Chesapeake
Bay
's
once-flourishing
oyster
population
historically
filtered
excess
nutrients
from
the
estuary
's
entire
water
volume
every
three
to
four
days
.

Today
,
that
would
take
nearly
a
year
.

Excess
sediment
,
nutrients
,
and
algae
can
result
in
the
eutrophication
of
a
body
of
water
.

Oyster
filtration
can
mitigate
these
pollutants
.

In
addition
to
their
gills
,
oysters
can
also
exchange
gases
across
their
mantles
,
which
are
lined
with
many
small
,
thin-walled
blood
vessels
.

A
small
,
three-chambered
heart
,
lying
under
the
adductor
muscle
,
pumps
colorless
blood
to
all
parts
of
the
body
.

At
the
same
time
,
two
kidneys
,
located
on
the
underside
of
the
muscle
,
remove
waste
products
from
the
blood
.

While
some
oysters
have
two
sexes
(
European
oyster
and
Olympia
oyster
)
,
their
reproductive
organs
contain
both
eggs
and
sperm
.

Because
of
this
,
it
is
technically
possible
for
an
oyster
to
fertilize
its
own
egg
.

The
gonads
surround
the
digestive
organs
,
and
are
made
up
of
sex
cells
,
branching
tubules
,
and
connective
tissue
.

Once
the
female
is
fertilized
,
she
discharges
millions
of
eggs
into
the
water
.

The
larvae
develop
in
about
six
hours
and
swim
around
for
about
two
to
three
weeks
.

After
that
,
they
settle
on
a
bed
and
mature
within
a
year
.

Habitat
and
behaviour
A
group
of
oysters
is
commonly
called
a
bed
or
oyster
reef
.

As
a
keystone
species
,
oysters
provide
habitat
for
many
marine
species
.

Crassostrea
and
Saccostrea
live
mainly
in
the
intertidal
zone
,
while
Ostrea
is
subtidal
.

The
hard
surfaces
of
oyster
shells
and
the
nooks
between
the
shells
provide
places
where
a
host
of
small
animals
can
live
.

Hundreds
of
animals
,
such
as
sea
anemones
,
barnacles
,
and
hooked
mussels
,
inhabit
oyster
reef
s.
Many
of
these
animals
are
prey
to
larger
animals
,
including
fish
,
such
as
striped
bass
,
black
drum
and
croakers
.

An
oyster
reef
can
increase
the
surface
area
of
a
flat
bottom
00-fold
.

An
oyster
's
mature
shape
often
depends
on
the
type
of
bottom
to
which
it
is
originally
attached
,
but
it
always
orients
itself
with
its
outer
,
flared
shell
tilted
upward
.

One
valve
is
cupped
and
the
other
is
flat
.

Oysters
usually
reach
maturity
in
one
year
.

They
are
protandric
;
during
their
first
year
,
they
spawn
as
males
by
releasing
sperm
into
the
water
.

As
they
grow
over
the
next
two
or
three
years
and
develop
greater
energy
reserves
,
they
spawn
as
females
by
releasing
eggs
.

Bay
oyster
s
usually
spawn
by
the
end
of
June
.

An
increase
in
water
temperature
prompts
a
few
oysters
to
spawn
.

This
triggers
spawning
in
the
rest
,
clouding
the
water
with
millions
of
eggs
and
sperm
.

A
single
female
oyster
can
produce
up
to
000
million
eggs
annually
.

The
eggs
become
fertilized
in
the
water
and
develop
into
larvae
,
which
eventually
find
suitable
sites
,
such
as
another
oyster
's
shell
,
on
which
to
settle
.

Attached
oyster
larvae
are
called
spat
.

Spat
are
oysters
less
than
long
.

Many
species
of
bivalves
,
oysters
included
,
seem
to
be
stimulated
to
settle
near
adult
conspecific
s.
Some
tropical
oysters
in
the
family
Isognomonidae
grow
best
on
mangrove
roots
.

Low
tide
can
expose
them
,
making
them
easy
to
collect
.

In
Trinidad
in
the
West
Indies
,
tourists
are
often
astounded
when
they
are
told
,
in
the
Caribbean
,
"
oysters
grow
on
trees
"
.

The
largest
oyster-producing
body
of
water
in
the
United
States
is
located
in
Chesapeake
Bay
,
although
these
beds
have
decreased
in
number
due
to
overfishing
and
pollution
.

Willapa
Bay
in
Washington
produces
more
oysters
than
any
other
estuary
in
the
US
.

Other
large
oyster
farming
areas
in
the
US
include
the
bays
and
estuaries
along
the
coast
of
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
from
Apalachicola
,
Florida
on
the
east
to
Galveston
,
Texas
on
the
west
.

Large
beds
of
edible
oysters
are
also
found
in
Japan
and
Australia
.

In
0000
,
China
accounted
for
00
%
of
the
global
oyster
harvest
.

Within
Europe
,
France
remained
the
industry
leader
.

Common
oyster
predators
include
crab
s
,
sea
bird
s
,
starfish
,
and
human
s.
Some
oysters
contain
live
crabs
,
known
as
oyster
crab
s.
Nutrient
cycling
Bivalves
,
including
oysters
,
are
effective
filter
feeders
and
can
have
large
effects
on
the
water
columns
in
which
they
occur
.

As
filter
feeders
,
oysters
remove
plankton
and
organic
particles
from
the
water
column
.

Multiple
studies
have
shown
individual
oysters
are
capable
of
filtering
up
to
00
gallons
of
water
per
day
,
and
thus
oyster
reefs
can
significantly
improve
water
quality
and
clarity
.

Oysters
consume
nitrogen-containing
compounds
(
nitrate
s
and
ammonia
)
,
phosphates
,
plankton
,
detritus
,
bacteria
,
and
dissolved
organic
matter
,
removing
them
from
the
water
.

What
is
not
used
for
animal
growth
is
then
expelled
as
solid
waste
pellets
,
which
eventually
decompose
into
the
atmosphere
as
nitrogen
.

In
Maryland
,
the
Chesapeake
Bay
Program
plans
to
use
oysters
to
reduce
the
amount
of
nitrogen
compounds
entering
the
Chesapeake
Bay
by
per
year
by
0000
.

Ecosystem
services
As
an
ecosystem
engineer
oysters
provide
"
supporting
"
ecosystem
services
,
along
with
"
provisioning
"
,
"
regulating
"
and
"
cultural
"
services
.

(
See
ecosystem
services
for
service
definitions
and
explanation
.
)

Oysters
influence
nutrient
cycling
,
water
filtration
,
habitat
structure
,
biodiversity
,
and
food
web
dynamics
.

Oyster
feeding
and
nutrient
cycling
activities
could
"
rebalance
"
shallow
,
coastal
ecosystems
if
restoration
of
historic
populations
could
be
achieved
.

Furthermore
,
assimilation
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
into
shellfish
tissues
provides
an
opportunity
to
remove
these
nutrients
from
the
environment
,
but
this
benefit
has
only
recently
been
recognized
.

In
California
's
Tomales
Bay
,
native
oyster
presence
is
associated
with
higher
species
diversity
of
benthic
invertebrates
but
other
ecosystem
services
have
not
been
studied
.

As
the
ecological
and
economic
importance
of
oyster
reefs
has
become
more
widely
acknowledged
,
creation
of
oyster
reef
habitat
through
restoration
efforts
has
become
more
important
-
often
with
the
goal
of
restoring
multiple
ecosystem
services
associated
with
natural
oyster
reefs
.

Human
history
Midden
s
testify
to
the
prehistoric
importance
of
oysters
as
food
.

In
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
town
of
Whitstable
is
noted
for
oyster
farming
from
beds
on
the
Kentish
Flats
that
have
been
used
since
Roman
times
.

The
borough
of
Colchester
holds
an
annual
Oyster
Feast
each
October
,
at
which
"
Colchester
Natives
"
(
the
native
oyster
,
Ostrea
edulis
)
are
consumed
.

The
United
Kingdom
hosts
several
other
annual
oyster
festivals
,
for
example
Woburn
Oyster
Festival
is
held
in
September
.

Many
breweries
produce
Oyster
Stout
,
a
beer
intended
to
be
drunk
with
oysters
that
sometimes
includes
oysters
in
the
brewing
process
.

The
French
seaside
resort
of
Cancale
is
noted
for
its
oysters
,
which
also
date
from
Roman
times
.

Sergius
Orata
of
the
Roman
Republic
is
considered
the
first
major
merchant
and
cultivator
of
oysters
.

Using
his
considerable
knowledge
of
hydraulic
s
,
he
built
a
sophisticated
cultivation
system
,
including
channels
and
locks
,
to
control
the
tides
.

He
was
so
famous
for
this
,
the
Romans
used
to
say
he
could
breed
oysters
on
the
roof
of
his
house
.

In
Ireland
,
it
is
traditional
to
eat
them
live
with
Guinness
and
buttered
brown
soda
bread
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
oysters
were
cheap
and
mainly
eaten
by
the
working
class
.

Throughout
the
00th
century
,
oyster
beds
in
New
York
harbor
became
the
largest
source
of
oysters
worldwide
.

On
any
day
in
the
late
00th
century
,
six
million
oysters
could
be
found
on
barges
tied
up
along
the
city
’s
waterfront
.

They
were
naturally
quite
popular
in
New
York
City
,
and
helped
initiate
the
city
’s
restaurant
trade
.

New
York
's
oystermen
became
skilled
cultivators
of
their
beds
,
which
provided
employment
for
hundreds
of
workers
and
nutritious
food
for
thousands
.

Eventually
,
rising
demand
exhausted
many
of
the
beds
.

To
increase
production
,
they
introduced
foreign
species
,
which
brought
disease
;
effluent
and
increasing
sedimentation
from
erosion
destroyed
most
of
the
beds
by
the
early
00th
century
.

Oysters
’
popularity
has
put
ever-increasing
demands
on
wild
oyster
stocks
.

This
scarcity
increased
prices
,
converting
them
from
their
original
role
as
working-class
food
to
their
current
status
as
an
expensive
delicacy
.

In
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
native
variety
(
Ostrea
edulis
)
is
still
held
to
be
the
finest
,
requiring
five
years
to
mature
and
protected
by
an
Act
of
Parliament
during
the
May
–
August
spawning
season
.

The
current
market
is
dominated
by
the
larger
Pacific
oyster
and
rock
oyster
varieties
which
are
farmed
year
round
.

Fishing
from
the
wild
Oysters
are
harvested
by
simply
gathering
them
from
their
beds
.

In
very
shallow
waters
,
they
can
be
gathered
by
hand
or
with
small
rakes
.

In
somewhat
deeper
water
,
long-handled
rakes
or
oyster
tongs
are
used
to
reach
the
beds
.

Patent
tong
s
can
be
lowered
on
a
line
to
reach
beds
that
are
too
deep
to
reach
directly
.

In
all
cases
,
the
task
is
the
same
:
the
oysterman
scrapes
oysters
into
a
pile
,
and
then
scoops
them
up
with
the
rake
or
tongs
.

In
some
areas
,
a
scallop
dredge
is
used
.

This
is
a
toothed
bar
attached
to
a
chain
bag
.

The
dredge
is
towed
through
an
oyster
bed
by
a
boat
,
picking
up
the
oysters
in
its
path
.

While
dredges
collect
oysters
more
quickly
,
they
heavily
damage
the
beds
,
and
their
use
is
highly
restricted
.

Until
0000
,
Maryland
limited
dredging
to
sailboat
s
,
and
even
since
then
motor
boats
can
be
used
only
on
certain
days
of
the
week
.

These
regulations
prompted
the
development
of
specialized
sailboat
s
(
the
bugeye
and
later
the
skipjack
)
for
dredging
.

Oysters
can
also
be
collected
by
divers
.

In
any
case
,
when
the
oysters
are
collected
,
they
are
sorted
to
eliminate
dead
animals
,
bycatch
(
unwanted
catch
)
,
and
debris
.

Then
they
are
taken
to
market
,
where
they
are
either
canned
or
sold
live
.

Cultivating
oysters
Oysters
have
been
cultured
for
well
over
a
century
.

The
Pacific
oyster
,
Crassostrea
gigas
,
is
presently
the
most
widely
grown
bivalve
around
the
world
.

Two
methods
are
commonly
used
,
release
and
bagging
.

In
both
cases
,
oysters
are
cultivated
onshore
to
the
size
of
spat
,
when
they
can
attach
themselves
to
a
substrate
.

They
may
be
allowed
to
mature
further
to
form
'
seed
oysters
'
.

In
either
case
,
they
are
then
placed
in
the
water
to
mature
.

The
release
technique
involves
distributing
the
spat
throughout
existing
oyster
beds
,
allowing
them
to
mature
naturally
to
be
collected
like
wild
oysters
.

Bagging
has
the
cultivator
putting
spat
in
racks
or
bags
and
keeping
them
above
the
bottom
.

Harvesting
involves
simply
lifting
the
bags
or
rack
to
the
surface
and
removing
the
mature
oysters
.

The
latter
method
prevents
losses
to
some
predators
,
but
is
more
expensive
.

The
Pacific
or
Japanese
oyster
,
Crassostrea
gigas
,
has
been
grown
in
the
outflow
of
mariculture
ponds
.

When
fish
or
prawn
s
are
grown
in
ponds
,
it
takes
,
typically
of
feed
to
produce
of
product
(
dry-dry
basis
)
.

The
other
goes
into
the
pond
and
after
mineralization
,
provides
food
for
phytoplankton
,
which
in
turn
feeds
the
oyster
.

To
prevent
spawning
,
sterile
oysters
are
now
cultured
by
crossbreeding
tetraploid
and
diploid
oysters
.

The
resulting
triploid
oyster
can
not
propagate
,
which
prevents
introduced
oysters
from
spreading
into
unwanted
habitats
.

Restoration
and
recovery
In
many
areas
,
non-native
oysters
have
been
introduced
in
attempts
to
prop
up
failing
harvests
of
native
varieties
.

For
example
,
the
eastern
oyster
was
introduced
to
California
waters
in
0000
,
while
the
Pacific
oyster
was
introduced
there
in
0000
.

Proposals
for
further
such
introductions
remain
controversial
.

The
Pacific
oyster
prospered
in
Pendrell
Sound
,
where
the
surface
water
is
typically
warm
enough
for
spawning
in
the
summer
.

Over
the
following
years
,
spat
spread
out
sporadically
and
populated
adjacent
areas
.

Eventually
,
possibly
following
adaptation
to
the
local
conditions
,
the
Pacific
oyster
spread
up
and
down
the
coast
and
now
is
the
basis
of
the
North
American
west
coast
oyster
industry
.

Pendrell
Sound
is
now
a
reserve
that
supplies
spat
for
cultivation
.

Near
the
mouth
of
the
Great
Wicomico
River
in
the
Chesapeake
Bay
,
five
year-old
artificial
reefs
now
harbor
more
than
000
million
native
Crassostrea
virginica
.

That
is
far
lower
than
in
the
late
0000s
,
when
the
bay
’s
population
was
in
the
billions
,
and
watermen
harvested
about
annually
.

The
0000
harvest
was
less
than
.

Researchers
claim
the
keys
to
the
project
were
:
The
oyster-tecture
movement
promotes
the
use
of
oyster
reefs
for
water
purification
and
wave
attenuation
.

An
"
Oyster-tecture
"
project
has
been
implemented
at
Withers
Estuary
,
Withers
Swash
,
South
Carolina
,
by
Neil
Chambers-led
volunteers
,
at
a
site
where
pollution
was
affecting
beach
tourism
.

Currently
,
for
the
installation
cost
of
$
0000
,
roughly
0.0
million
liters
of
water
are
being
filtered
daily
.

In
New
Jersey
,
however
,
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
refused
to
allow
oysters
as
a
filtering
system
in
Sandy
Hook
Bay
and
the
Raritan
Bay
,
citing
worries
that
commercial
shellfish
growers
would
be
at
risk
and
that
members
of
the
public
might
disregard
warnings
and
consume
tainted
oysters
.

New
Jersey
Baykeepers
responded
by
changing
their
strategy
for
utilizing
oysters
to
clean
up
the
waterway
,
by
partnering
with
Naval
Weapons
Station
Earle
.

The
Navy
station
is
under
00/0
security
and
therefore
eliminates
any
poaching
and
associated
human
health
risk
.

Oyster-tecture
projects
have
been
proposed
to
protect
coastal
cities
,
such
as
New
York
,
from
the
threat
of
rising
sea
levels
due
to
climate
change
.

As
food
Jonathan
Swift
is
quoted
as
having
said
,
"
He
was
a
bold
man
that
first
ate
an
oyster
"
,
but
evidence
of
oyster
consumption
goes
back
into
prehistory
,
evidenced
by
oyster
middens
found
worldwide
.

Oysters
were
an
important
food
source
in
all
coastal
areas
where
they
could
be
found
,
and
oyster
fisheries
were
an
important
industry
where
they
were
plentiful
.

Overfishing
and
pressure
from
diseases
and
pollution
have
sharply
reduced
supplies
,
but
they
remain
a
popular
treat
celebrated
in
oyster
festival
s
in
many
cities
and
towns
.

It
was
once
assumed
that
oysters
were
only
safe
to
eat
in
months
with
the
letter
‘
r
’
in
their
English
and
French
names
.

This
myth
is
based
in
truth
,
in
that
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere
,
oysters
are
much
more
likely
to
spoil
in
May
,
June
,
July
,
and
August
.

Nutrition
Oysters
are
an
excellent
source
of
zinc
,
iron
,
calcium
,
and
selenium
,
as
well
as
vitamin
A
and
vitamin
B00
.

Oysters
are
low
in
food
energy
;
one
dozen
raw
oysters
contains
.

Oysters
are
considered
most
nutritious
when
eaten
raw
.

Traditionally
,
oysters
are
considered
to
be
an
aphrodisiac
,
partially
because
they
resemble
female
sex
organs
.

A
team
of
American
and
Italian
researchers
analyzed
bivalves
and
found
they
were
rich
in
amino
acids
that
trigger
increased
levels
of
sex
hormone
s.
Their
high
zinc
content
aids
the
production
of
testosterone
.

Dietary
supplements
may
contain
calcium
carbonate
from
oyster
shells
,
though
no
evidence
shows
this
offers
any
benefits
beyond
what
calcium
may
offer
.

Selection
,
preparation
and
storage
Unlike
most
shellfish
,
oysters
can
have
a
fairly
long
shelf
life
of
up
to
four
weeks
.

However
,
their
taste
becomes
less
pleasant
as
they
age
.

Oysters
should
be
refrigerated
out
of
water
,
not
frozen
,
and
in
000
%
humidity
.

Oysters
stored
in
water
under
refrigeration
will
open
,
consume
available
oxygen
,
and
die
.

Oysters
must
be
eaten
alive
,
or
cooked
alive
.

The
shells
of
live
oysters
are
normally
tightly
closed
or
snap
shut
given
a
slight
tap
.

If
the
shell
is
open
,
the
oyster
is
dead
,
and
can
not
be
eaten
safely
.

Cooking
oysters
in
the
shell
kills
the
oysters
and
causes
them
to
open
by
themselves
.

Traditionally
,
oysters
that
do
not
open
have
been
assumed
to
be
dead
before
cooking
and
therefore
unsafe
.

However
,
according
to
at
least
one
marine
biologist
,
Nick
Ruello
,
this
advice
may
have
arisen
from
an
old
,
poorly
researched
cookbook
's
advice
regarding
mussels
,
which
has
now
become
an
assumed
truism
for
all
shellfish
.

Ruello
found
00.0
%
of
all
mussels
failed
to
open
during
cooking
,
but
when
forced
open
,
000
%
were
"
both
adequately
cooked
and
safe
to
eat
.
"

Oysters
can
be
eaten
on
the
half
shell
,
raw
,
smoked
,
boiled
,
baked
,
fried
,
roasted
,
stewed
,
canned
,
pickled
,
steamed
,
or
broiled
,
or
used
in
a
variety
of
drinks
.

Eating
can
be
as
simple
as
opening
the
shell
and
eating
the
contents
,
including
juice
.

Butter
and
salt
are
often
added
.

In
the
case
of
oysters
Rockefeller
,
preparation
can
be
very
elaborate
.

They
are
sometimes
served
on
edible
seaweed
,
such
as
brown
algae
.

Care
should
be
taken
when
consuming
oysters
.

Purists
insist
on
eating
them
raw
,
with
no
dressing
save
perhaps
lemon
juice
,
vinegar
(
most
commonly
shallot
vinegar
)
,
or
cocktail
sauce
.

Upscale
restaurants
pair
raw
oysters
with
a
home-made
Mignonette
sauce
,
which
consists
primarily
of
fresh
chopped
shallot
,
mixed
pepper
corn
,
dry
white
wine
and
lemon
juice
or
sherry
vinegar
.

Like
fine
wine
,
raw
oysters
have
complex
flavors
that
vary
greatly
among
varieties
and
regions
:
sweet
,
salty
,
earthy
,
or
even
melon
.

The
texture
is
soft
and
fleshy
,
but
crisp
on
the
palate
.

North
American
varieties
include
:
Kumamoto
and
Yaquina
Bay
from
Oregon
,
Malpeque
from
Prince
Edward
Island
,
Canada
,
Blue
Point
from
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
and
Cape
May
oysters
from
New
Jersey
.

Salinity
,
mineral
,
and
nutrient
variations
in
the
water
that
nurtures
them
influence
their
flavor
profile
.

Oysters
can
contain
harmful
bacteria
.

Oysters
are
filter
feeders
,
so
will
naturally
concentrate
anything
present
in
the
surrounding
water
.

Oysters
from
the
Gulf
Coast
of
the
United
States
,
for
example
,
contain
high
bacterial
loads
of
human
pathogens
in
the
warm
months
,
most
notably
Vibrio
vulnificus
and
Vibrio
parahaemolyticus
.

In
these
cases
,
the
main
danger
is
for
immunocompromised
individuals
,
who
are
unable
to
fight
off
infection
and
can
succumb
to
septicemia
,
leading
to
death
.

Vibrio
vulnificus
is
the
most
deadly
seafood-borne
pathogen
,
with
a
higher
case-to-death
ratio
than
even
Salmonella
enterica
.

Opening
oysters
Fresh
oysters
must
be
alive
just
before
consumption
or
cooking
.

There
is
only
one
criterion
:
the
oyster
must
be
capable
of
tightly
closing
its
shell
.

Open
oysters
should
be
tapped
on
the
shell
;
a
live
oyster
will
close
up
and
is
safe
to
eat
.

Oysters
which
are
open
and
unresponsive
are
dead
and
must
be
discarded
.

Some
dead
oysters
,
or
oyster
shells
which
are
full
of
sand
may
be
closed
.

These
make
a
distinctive
noise
when
tapped
,
and
are
known
as
'
clackers
'
.

Opening
oysters
requires
skill
.

The
preferred
method
is
to
use
a
special
knife
(
called
an
oyster
knife
,
a
variant
of
a
shucking
knife
)
,
with
a
short
and
thick
blade
about
long
.

While
different
methods
are
used
to
open
an
oyster
(
which
sometimes
depend
on
the
type
)
,
the
following
is
one
commonly
accepted
oyster-shucking
method
.

Inexperienced
shuckers
can
apply
too
much
force
,
which
can
result
in
injury
if
the
blade
slips
.

Heavy
gloves
are
necessary
;
apart
from
the
knife
,
the
shell
itself
can
be
razor
sharp
.

Professional
shuckers
require
less
than
three
seconds
to
open
the
shell
.

If
the
oyster
has
a
particularly
soft
shell
,
the
knife
can
be
inserted
instead
in
the
'
sidedoor
'
,
about
halfway
along
one
side
where
the
oyster
lips
widen
with
a
slight
indentation
.

Opening
or
"
shucking
"
oysters
has
become
a
competitive
sport
.

Oyster-shucking
competitions
are
staged
around
the
world
.

Widely
acknowledged
to
be
the
premiere
event
,
the
Guinness
World
Oyster
Opening
Championship
is
held
in
September
at
the
Galway
Oyster
Festival
.

The
annual
Clarenbridge
Oyster
Festival
'
Oyster
Opening
Competition
'
is
also
held
in
Galway
,
Ireland
.

Ethical
considerations
The
oyster
is
considered
by
some
ethicists
to
be
an
appropriate
food
choice
for
those
concerned
with
animal
rights
,
arguing
it
is
acceptable
to
eat
oysters
due
to
their
lack
of
a
central
nervous
system
and
the
generally
sustainable
and
environmentally
friendly
way
in
which
they
are
raised
and
harvested
.

One
common
ethical
objection
to
the
consumption
of
animals
is
that
their
cultivation
is
environmentally
harmful
.

Regarding
environmental
impact
,
00
%
of
oysters
are
sustainably
farmed
and
harvested
(
other
bivalves
are
frequently
harvested
by
harmful
dredging
)
,
feed
on
plankton
(
very
low
on
the
food
chain
)
,
and
in
fact
improve
the
marine
environment
by
removing
toxins
.

As
such
,
farmed
oysters
are
listed
as
a
"
Best
Choice
"
(
highest
rating
)
on
the
Seafood
Watch
list
.

The
view
that
oysters
are
acceptable
to
eat
,
even
by
strict
ethical
criteria
,
has
notably
been
propounded
in
the
seminal
0000
text
Animal
Liberation
,
by
philosopher
Peter
Singer
.

However
,
subsequent
editions
have
reversed
this
position
(
advocating
against
eating
oysters
)
.

Singer
has
stated
he
has
"
gone
back
and
forth
on
this
over
the
years
"
,
and
as
of
0000
,
says
,
"
while
you
could
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
you
could
also
say
that
unless
some
new
evidence
of
a
capacity
for
pain
emerges
,
the
doubt
is
so
slight
that
there
is
no
good
reason
for
avoiding
eating
sustainably
produced
oysters
"
.

Diseases
Oysters
are
subject
to
various
diseases
which
can
reduce
harvests
and
severely
deplete
local
populations
.

Disease
control
focuses
on
containing
infections
and
breeding
resistant
strains
,
and
is
the
subject
of
much
ongoing
research
.

Some
oysters
also
harbor
bacterial
species
which
can
cause
human
disease
;
of
importance
is
Vibrio
vulnificus
,
which
causes
gastroenteritis
,
which
is
usually
self-limiting
,
and
cellulitis
.

Cellulitis
can
be
so
severe
and
rapidly
spreading
,
often
it
requires
amputation
.

It
is
usually
acquired
when
the
contents
of
the
oyster
come
in
contact
with
a
cut
skin
lesion
,
as
when
shucking
an
oyster
.

.

History
The
land
that
would
become
Forest
City
was
settled
in
0000
by
William
Pentecost
and
family
and
chosen
for
its
dense
forest
,
of
which
only
a
small
portion
of
the
original
forest
still
remains
today
in
the
Industrial
Park
(
where
mine
#
0
was
once
located
)
and
at
the
beginning
of
Delaware
Street
.

Originally
called
"
Forest
Mills
"
,
it
was
settled
by
lumbermen
and
their
families
.

Between

and
0000
,
the
Jefferson
Branch
,
a
railroad
spur
of
the
D
&
H
Canal
Company
.

,
was
built
in
Forest
Mills
.

It
ran
between
Susquehanna
Depot
and
Carbondale
,
transporting
the
harvested
lumber
.

Lumbering
was
the
only
industry
of
this
area
,
with
the
exception
of
a
small
mining
operation
run
by
William
Pentecost
,
which
supplied
only
sufficient
coal
to
neighboring
farmers
for
winter
fuel
.

In
0000
,
an
outcropping
of
coal
was
discovered
.

The
Hillside
Coal
and
Iron
Company
bought
large
tracts
of
land
in
the
area
,
and
by
0000
the
first
commercially
profitable
coal
mining
enterprise
was
established
at
North
Railroad
Street
.

biggest
failure

with
the
dramedy
"
Garbo
Talks
"
,
starring
Anne
Bancroft
and
Ron
Silver
.

The
producers
of
the
film
were
sure
that
the
real
Garbo
either
could
not
be
located
or
would
flatly
turn
them
down
,
to
appear
in
a
cameo
in
the
film
.

They
did
try
however
,
with
a
known
associate
of
Greta
Garbo
's
,
who
was
located
and
was
asked
to
ask
the
great
actress
if
she
would
appear
in
the
film
.

But
the
associate
never
responded
back
.

So
Betty

was
asked
to
appear
in
film
for
the
brief
,
pivotal
'
over-the-shoulder
'
scenes
.

Comden

Harmony
Township

of
,

is

.

History
Harmony
Township
was
formed
in
0000
from
parts
of
Willingborough
and
New
Milford
Townships
.

The
present-day
Ararat
,
Oakland
,
Jackson
,
and
Thomson
Townships
were
later
split
from
parts
of
Harmony
Township
.

The
borough
of
Susquehanna
Depot
was
created
in
0000
from
part
of
Harmony
Township
.

Harmony
,
Pennsylvania
,
is
an
important
historical
site
in
the
Latter
Day
Saint
movement
.

Latter
Day
Saints
believe
that
Joseph
Smith
,
Jr.
and
Oliver
Cowdery
were
visited
by
the
angel
of
John
the
Baptist
near
Harmony
in
0000
,
where
he
bestowed
on
Smith
and
Cowdery
the
Aaronic
priesthood
.

Smith
and
Cowdery
subsequently
baptized
one
another
in
the
Susquehanna
River
.

Other
significant
events
occurred
there
during
the
periodic
residence
of
Smith
from
0000
to
0000
.

Harmony
was
the
home
of
Isaac
Hale
,
father
of
Smith
's
wife
,
Emma
Hale
.

Smith
and
his
father
boarded
with
Isaac
Hale
in
0000
while
working
on
Josiah
Stowell
's
mining
project
.

In
December
0000
,
Smith
and
Emma
moved
to
Harmony
from
Manchester
,
New
York
,
to
work
on
the
Book
of
Mormon
.

Eventually
they
bought
a
small
farm
and
house
,
where
most
of
the
Book
of
Mormon
was
produced
between
April
0
and
early
June
0000
.

The
first
convert
baptism
,
that
of
Samuel
H.
Smith
,
took
place
there
ten
days
after
Smith
and
Cowdery
had
baptized
each
other
.

Somewhere
between
Harmony
and
Colesville
,
New
York
,
Peter
,
James
,
and
John
bestowed
upon
Smith
and
Cowdery
the
Melchizedek
priesthood
.

After
the
Church
of
Christ
was
organized
by
Smith
in
0000
,
Smith
and
Emma
returned
to
Harmony
and
lived
there
through
that
summer
.

Fifteen
revelations
now
found
in
the
Doctrine
and
Covenants
were
received
in
Harmony
.

The
Harmony
in
Latter
Day
Saint
history
refers
to
a
township
rather
than
the
village
of
Harmony
.

The
township
boundary
was
changed
in
0000
,
placing
the
Latter
Day
Saint
sites
in
present-day
Oakland
Township
.

The
site
of
the
Hale
residence
lies
about
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
present-day
Oakland
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
Susquehanna
County
,
along
the
north
side
of

The
Church
of

a
granite

monument
dedicated
in

commemorates
the

of
the
restoration
is

Crime
and
Punishment
(
Prestupleniye
i
nakazaniye
)
is
a
novel
by
the
Russian
author
Fyodor
Dostoyevsky
.

It
was
first
published
in
the
literary
journal
The
Russian
Messenger
in
twelve
monthly
installments
during
0000
.

It
was
later
published
in
a
single
volume
.

This
is
the
second
of
Dostoyevsky
's
full-length
novels
following
his
return
from
ten
years
of
exile
in
Siberia
.

Crime
and
Punishment
is
the
first
great
novel
of
his
"
mature
"
period
of
writing
.

Crime
and
Punishment
focuses
on
the
mental
anguish
and
moral
dilemma
s
of
Rodion
Raskolnikov
,
an
impoverished
ex-student
in
St.
Petersburg
who
formulates
and
executes
a
plan
to
kill
an
unscrupulous
pawnbroker
for
her
cash
.

Raskolnikov
argues
that
with
the
pawnbroker
's
money
he
can
perform
good
deeds
to
counterbalance
the
crime
,
while
ridding
the
world
of
a
worthless
vermin
.

He
also
commits
this
murder
to
test
his
own
hypothesis
that
some
people
are
naturally
capable
of
such
things
,
and
even
have
the
right
to
do
them
.

Several
times
throughout
the
novel
,
Raskolnikov
justifies
his
actions
by
connecting
himself
mentally
with
Napoleon
Bonaparte
,
believing
that
murder
is
permissible
in
pursuit
of
a
higher
purpose
.

Creation
Dostoyevsky
conceived
the
idea
of
Crime
and
Punishment
in
the
summer
of
0000
,
having
gambled
away
much
of
his
fortune
,
unable
to
pay
his
bills
or
afford
proper
meals
.

At
the
time
the
author
owed
large
sums
of
money
to
creditors
,
and
was
trying
to
help
the
family
of
his
brother
Mikhail
,
who
had
died
in
early
0000
.

Projected
under
the
title
The
Drunkards
,
it
was
to
deal
"
with
the
present
question
of
drunkness
...
[
in
]
all
its
ramifications
,
especially
the
picture
of
a
family
and
the
bringing
up
of
children
in
these
circumstance
,
etc.
,
etc.
"
Once
Dostoyevsky
conceived
Raskolnikov
and
his
crime
,
now
inspired
by
the
case
of
Pierre
François
Lacenaire
,
this
theme
became
ancillary
,
centering
on
the
story
of
the
Marmeladov
family
.

Dostoyevsky
offered
his
story
or
novella
(
at
the
time
Dostoyevsky
was
not
thinking
of
a
novel
)
to
the
publisher
Mikhail
Katkov
,
whose
monthly
journal
,
The
Russian
Messenger
,
was
a
prestigious
publication
of
its
kind
,
and
the
outlet
for
both
Ivan
Turgenev
and
Leo
Tolstoy
.

However
,
Dostoyevsky
,
having
carried
on
quite
bruising
polemics
with
Katkov
in
early
0000s
,
had
never
published
anything
in
its
pages
.

Nonetheless
,
forced
by
his
situation
,
after
all
other
appeals
elsewhere
failed
,
Dostoyevsky
turned
as
a
last
resort
to
Katkov
,
urging
for
an
advance
on
a
proposed
contribution
.

In
a
letter
to
Katkov
written
in
September
0000
,
Dostoyevsky
explained
to
him
that
the
work
was
to
be
about
a
young
man
who
yields
to
"
certain
strange
,
'
unfinished
'
ideas
,
yet
floating
in
the
air
"
;
he
had
thus
embarked
on
his
plan
to
explore
the
moral
and
psychological
dangers
of
the
ideology
of
"
radicalism
"
.

In
letters
written
in
November
0000
an
important
conceptual
change
occurred
:
the
"
story
"
has
become
a
"
novel
"
,
and
from
here
on
all
references
to
Crime
and
Punishment
are
to
a
novel
.

Dostoyevsky
had
to
race
against
time
,
in
order
to
finish
on
time
both
The
Gambler
and
Crime
and
Punishment
.

Anna
Snitkina
,
a
stenographer
who
would
soon
become
his
second
wife
,
was
a
great
help
for
Dostoyevsky
during
this
difficult
task
.

The
first
part
of
Crime
and
Punishment
appeared
in
the
January
0000
issue
of
The
Russian
Messenger
,
and
the
last
one
was
published
in
December
0000
.

In
the
complete
edition
of
Dostoyevsky
's
writings
published
in
the
Soviet
Union
,
the
editors
reassembled
and
printed
the
notebooks
that
the
writer
kept
while
working
on
Crime
and
Punishment
,
in
a
sequence
roughly
corresponding
to
the
various
stages
of
composition
.

Because
of
these
labors
,
there
is
now
a
fragmentary
working
draft
of
the
story
,
or
novella
,
as
initially
conceived
,
as
well
as
two
other
versions
of
the
text
.

These
have
been
distinguished
as
the
Wiesbaden
edition
,
the
Petersburg
edition
,
and
the
final
plan
,
involving
the
shift
from
a
first-person
narrator
to
the
indigenous
variety
of
third-person
form
invented
by
Dostoyevsky
.

The
Wiesbaden
edition
concentrates
entirely
on
the
moral/physic
reactions
of
the
narrator
after
the
murder
.

It
coincides
roughly
with
the
story
that
Dostoyevsky
described
in
his
letter
to
Katkov
,
and
written
in
a
form
of
a
diary
or
journal
,
corresponds
to
what
eventually
became
part
II
.

Why
Dostoyevsky
abandoned
his
initial
version
remains
a
matter
of
speculation
.

According
to
Joseph
Frank
,
"
one
possibility
is
that
his
protagonist
began
to
develop
beyond
the
boundaries
in
which
he
had
first
been
conceived
"
.

The
notebooks
indicate
that
Dostoyevsky
was
aware
of
the
emergence
of
new
aspects
of
Raskolnikov
's
character
as
the
plot
action
proceeded
,
and
he
structured
the
novel
in
conformity
with
this
"
metamorphosis
,
"
Frank
says
.

Dostoyevsky
thus
decided
to
fuse
the
story
with
his
previous
idea
for
a
novel
called
The
Drunkards
.

The
final
version
of
Crime
and
Punishment
came
to
birth
only
when
,
in
November
0000
,
Dostoyevsky
decided
to
recast
his
novel
in
the
third
person
.

This
shift
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
struggle
,
present
through
all
the
early
stages
of
composition
.

Once
having
decided
,
Dostoyevsky
began
to
rewrite
from
scratch
,
and
was
able
to
easily
integrate
sections
of
the
early
manuscript
into
the
final
text
—
Frank
says
that
he
did
not
,
as
he
told
Wrangel
,
burn
everything
he
had
written
earlier
.

The
final
draft
went
smoothly
,
except
for
a
clash
with
the
editors
of
The
Russian
Messenger
,
about
which
very
little
is
known
.

Since
the
manuscript
Dostoyevsky
turned
in
to
Katkov
was
lost
,
it
is
unclear
to
what
the
editors
had
objected
in
the
original
.

Plot
Raskolnikov
,
a
conflicted
former
student
,
lives
in
a
tiny
,
rented
room
in
Saint
Petersburg
.

He
refuses
all
help
,
even
from
his
friend
Razumikhin
,
and
devises
a
plan
to
murder
and
to
rob
an
unpleasant
elderly
pawn-broker
and
money-lender
,
Alyona
Ivanovna
.

His
motivation
comes
from
the
overwhelming
sense
that
he
is
predetermined
to
kill
the
old
woman
by
some
power
outside
of
himself
.

While
still
considering
the
plan
,
Raskolnikov
makes
the
acquaintance
of
Semyon
Zakharovich
Marmeladov
,
a
drunkard
who
recently
squandered
his
family
's
little
wealth
.

He
also
receives
a
letter
from
his
sister
and
mother
,
speaking
of
their
coming
visit
to
Saint
Petersburg
,
and
his
sister
's
sudden
marriage
plans
which
they
plan
to
discuss
upon
their
arrival
.

After
much
deliberation
,
Raskolnikov
sneaks
into
Alyona
Ivanovna
's
apartment
where
he
murders
her
with
an
axe
.

He
also
kills
her
half-sister
,
Lizaveta
,
who
happens
to
stumble
upon
the
scene
of
the
crime
.

Shaken
by
his
actions
,
Raskolnikov
manages
to
steal
only
a
handful
of
items
and
a
small
purse
,
leaving
much
of
the
pawn-broker
's
wealth
untouched
.

Raskolnikov
then
flees
and
,
due
to
a
series
of
coincidences
,
manages
to
leave
unseen
and
undetected
.

After
the
bungled
murder
,
Raskolnikov
falls
into
a
feverish
state
and
begins
to
worry
obsessively
over
the
murder
.

He
hides
the
stolen
items
and
purse
under
a
rock
,
and
tries
desperately
to
clean
his
clothing
of
any
blood
or
evidence
.

He
falls
into
a
fever
later
that
day
,
though
not
before
calling
briefly
on
his
old
friend
Razumikhin
.

As
the
fever
comes
and
goes
in
the
following
days
,
Raskolnikov
behaves
as
though
he
wishes
to
betray
himself
.

He
shows
strange
reactions
to
whoever
mentions
the
murder
of
the
pawn-broker
,
which
is
now
known
about
and
talked
of
in
the
city
.

In
his
delirium
,
Raskolnikov
wanders
Saint
Petersburg
,
drawing
more
and
more
attention
to
himself
and
his
relation
to
the
crime
.

In
one
of
his
walks
through
the
city
,
he
sees
Marmeladov
,
who
has
been
struck
mortally
by
a
carriage
in
the
streets
.

Rushing
to
help
him
,
Raskolnikov
gives
the
remainder
of
his
money
to
the
man
's
family
,
which
includes
his
teenage
daughter
,
Sonya
,
who
has
been
forced
to
become
a
prostitute
to
support
her
family
.

In
the
meantime
,
Raskolnikov
's
mother
,
Pulkheria
Alexandrovna
,
and
his
sister
,
Avdotya
Romanovna
(
or
Dounia
)
have
arrived
in
the
city
.

Avdotya
had
been
working
as
a
governess
for
the
Svidrigaïlov
family
until
this
point
,
but
was
forced
out
of
the
position
by
the
head
of
the
family
,
Arkady
Ivanovich
Svidrigaïlov
.

Svidrigaïlov
,
a
married
man
,
was
attracted
to
Avdotya
's
physical
beauty
and
her
feminine
qualities
,
and
offered
her
riches
and
elopement
.

Avdotya
,
having
none
of
this
,
fled
the
family
and
lost
her
source
of
income
,
only
to
meet
Pyotr
Petrovich
Luzhin
,
a
man
of
modest
income
and
rank
.

Luzhin
proposes
to
marry
Avdotya
,
thereby
securing
her
and
her
mother
's
financial
safety
,
provided
she
accept
him
quickly
and
without
question
.

It
is
for
these
very
reasons
that
the
two
of
them
come
to
Saint
Petersburg
,
both
to
meet
Luzhin
there
and
to
obtain
Raskolnikov
's
approval
.

Luzhin
,
however
,
calls
on
Raskolnikov
while
he
is
in
a
delirious
state
and
presents
himself
as
a
foolish
,
self-righteous
and
presuming
man
.

Raskolnikov
dismisses
him
immediately
as
a
potential
husband
for
his
sister
,
and
realizes
that
she
only
accepted
him
to
help
her
family
.

As
the
novel
progresses
,
Raskolnikov
is
introduced
to
the
detective
Porfiry
,
who
begins
to
suspect
him
for
the
murder
purely
on
psychological
grounds
.

At
the
same
time
,
a
chaste
relationship
develops
between
Raskolnikov
and
Sonya
.

Sonya
,
though
a
prostitute
,
is
full
of
Christian
virtue
and
is
only
driven
into
the
profession
by
her
family
's
poverty
.

Meanwhile
,
Razumikhin
and
Raskolnikov
manage
to
keep
Avdotya
from
continuing
her
relationship
with
Luzhin
,
whose
true
character
is
exposed
to
be
conniving
and
base
.

At
this
point
,
Svidrigaïlov
appears
on
the
scene
,
having
come
from
the
province
to
Petersburg
,
almost
solely
to
seek
out
Avdotya
.

He
reveals
that
his
wife
is
dead
,
and
that
he
is
willing
to
pay
Avdotya
a
vast
sum
of
money
in
exchange
for
nothing
.

She
,
upon
hearing
the
news
,
refuses
flat
out
,
suspecting
him
of
treachery
.

As
Raskolnikov
and
Porfiry
continue
to
meet
,
Raskolnikov
's
motives
for
the
crime
become
exposed
.

Porfiry
becomes
increasingly
certain
of
the
man
's
guilt
,
but
has
no
concrete
evidence
or
witnesses
with
which
to
back
up
this
suspicion
.

Furthermore
,
another
man
admits
to
committing
the
crime
under
questioning
and
arrest
.

However
,
Raskolnikov
's
nerves
continue
to
wear
thin
,
and
he
is
constantly
struggling
with
the
idea
of
confessing
,
though
he
knows
that
he
can
never
be
truly
convicted
.

He
turns
to
Sonya
for
support
and
confesses
his
crime
to
her
.

By
coincidence
,
Svidrigaïlov
has
taken
up
residence
in
a
room
next
to
Sonya
's
and
overhears
the
entire
confession
.

When
the
two
men
meet
face
to
face
,
Svidrigaïlov
acknowledges
this
fact
,
and
suggests
that
he
may
use
it
against
him
,
should
he
need
to
.

Svidrigaïlov
also
speaks
of
his
own
past
,
and
Raskolnikov
grows
to
suspect
that
the
rumors
about
his
having
committed
several
murders
are
true
.

In
a
later
conversation
with
Dounia
,
Svidrigaïlov
denies
that
he
had
a
hand
in
the
death
of
his
wife
.

Raskolnikov
is
at
this
point
completely
torn
;
he
is
urged
by
Sonya
to
confess
,
and
Svidrigaïlov
's
testimony
could
potentially
convict
him
.

Furthermore
,
Porfiry
confronts
Raskolnikov
with
his
suspicions
and
assures
him
confession
would
substantially
lighten
his
sentence
.

Meantime
,
Svidrigaïlov
attempts
to
seduce
Avdotya
,
but
when
he
realizes
that
she
will
never
love
him
,
he
lets
her
go
.

He
then
spends
a
night
in
confusion
and
in
the
morning
shoots
himself
.

This
same
morning
,
Raskolnikov
goes
again
to
Sonya
,
who
again
urges
him
to
confess
and
to
clear
his
conscience
.

He
makes
his
way
to
the
police
station
,
where
he
is
met
by
the
news
of
Svidrigaïlov
's
suicide
.

He
hesitates
a
moment
,
thinking
again
that
he
might
get
away
with
a
perfect
crime
,
but
is
persuaded
by
Sonya
to
confess
.

The
epilogue
tells
of
how
Raskolnikov
is
sentenced
to
eight
years
of
penal
servitude
in
Siberia
,
where
Sonya
follows
him
.

Avdotya
and
Razumikhin
marry
and
are
left
in
a
happy
position
by
the
end
of
the
novel
,
while
Pulkheria
,
Raskolnikov
's
mother
,
falls
ill
and
dies
,
unable
to
cope
with
her
son
's
situation
.

Raskolnikov
himself
struggles
in
Siberia
.

It
is
only
after
some
time
in
prison
that
his
redemption
and
moral
regeneration
begin
under
Sonya
's
loving
influence
.

Characters
In
Crime
and
Punishment
,
Dostoyevsky
succeeds
in
fusing
the
personality
of
his
main
character
,
Rodion
Romanovich
Raskolnikov
(
Russian
:
Родион
Романович
Раскольников
)
,
with
his
new
anti-radical
ideological
themes
.

The
main
plot
involves
a
murder
as
the
result
of
"
ideological
intoxication
,
"
and
depicts
all
the
disastrous
moral
and
psychical
consequences
that
result
from
the
murder
.

Raskolnikov
's
psychology
is
placed
at
the
center
,
and
carefully
interwoven
with
the
ideas
behind
his
transgression
;
every
other
feature
of
the
novel
illuminates
the
agonizing
dilemma
in
which
Raskolnikov
is
caught
.

From
another
point
of
view
,
the
novel
's
plot
is
another
variation
of
a
conventional
nineteenth-century
theme
:
an
innocent
young
provincial
comes
to
seek
his
fortune
in
the
capital
,
where
he
succumbs
to
corruption
,
and
loses
all
traces
of
his
former
freshness
and
purity
.

However
,
as
Gary
Rosenshield
points
out
,
"
Raskolnikov
succumbs
not
to
the
temptations
of
high
society
as
Honoré
de
Balzac
's
Rastignac
or
Stendhal
's
Julien
Sorel
,
but
to
those
of
rationalistic
Petersburg
"
.

Raskolnikov
(
Rodion
)
is
the
protagonist
,
and
the
novel
focuses
primarily
on
his
perspective
.

A
00-year-old
man
and
former
student
,
now
destitute
,
Raskolnikov
is
described
in
the
novel
as
"
exceptionally
handsome
,
above
the
average
in
height
,
slim
,
well
built
,
with
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
dark
brown
hair
.
"

Perhaps
the
most
striking
feature
of
Raskolnikov
,
however
,
is
his
dual
personality
.

On
the
one
hand
,
he
is
cold
,
apathetic
,
and
antisocial
;
on
the
other
,
he
can
be
surprisingly
warm
and
compassionate
.

He
commits
murder
as
well
as
acts
of
compulsive
charity
.

His
chaotic
interaction
with
the
external
world
and
his
nihlistic
worldview
might
be
seen
as
a
the
cause
of
his
social
alienation
or
the
consequence
of
it
.

Despite
its
name
,
the
novel
does
not
so
much
deal
with
the
crime
and
its
formal
punishment
,
as
with
Raskolnikov
's
internal
struggle
(
the
book
shows
that
his
punishment
results
more
from
his
conscience
than
from
the
law
)
.

Believing
society
would
be
better
for
it
,
Raskolnikov
commits
murder
with
the
idea
that
he
possessed
enough
intellectual
and
emotional
fortitude
to
deal
with
the
ramifications
,
[
based
on
his
paper/thesis
,
"
On
Crime
"
,
that
he
is
a
Napoleon
]
,
but
his
sense
of
guilt
soon
overwhelms
him
to
the
point
of
psychological
and
somatic
illness
.

It
is
only
in
the
epilogue
that
he
realizes
his
formal
punishment
,
having
decided
to
confess
and
end
his
alienation
from
society
.

Sofia
Semyonovna
Marmeladova
(
Russian
:
Софья
Семёновна
Мармеладова
)
,
variously
called
Sonia
(
Sonya
)
and
Sonechka
,
is
the
daughter
of
a
drunk
man
named
Semyon
Zakharovich
Marmeladov
,
whom
Raskolnikov
meets
in
a
tavern
at
the
beginning
of
the
novel
.

She
is
often
characterized
as
self-sacrificial
,
shy
,
and
even
innocent
despite
the
fact
that
she
is
compelled
into
prostitution
to
help
her
family
.

She
also
,
as
Raskolnikov
discerns
,
shares
the
same
feelings
of
shame
and
alienation
as
he
does
and
becomes
the
first
person
to
whom
Raskolnikov
confesses
his
crime
,
and
she
supports
him
even
though
she
was
friends
with
one
of
the
victims
(
Lizaveta
)
.

Throughout
the
novel
,
Sonya
is
an
important
source
of
moral
strength
and
rehabilitation
for
Raskolnikov
,
and
in
some
interpretations
,
even
considered
a
Christ-like
figure
.

She
is
forced
to
prostitute
herself
to
provide
for
her
family
,
leading
some
critics
to
make
comparisons
with
Mary
Magdalene
.

Avdotya
Romanovna
Raskolnikova
(
Авдотья
Романовна
Раскольникова
)
–
Raskolnikov
's
dominant
and
sympathetic
sister
,
called
Dunya
,
Dounia
or
Dunechka
for
short
.

She
initially
plans
to
marry
the
wealthy
,
yet
smug
and
self-possessed
,
Luzhin
,
to
free
the
family
from
financial
destitution
.

She
has
a
habit
of
pacing
across
the
room
while
thinking
.

She
is
followed
to
Saint
Petersburg
by
the
disturbed
Svidrigailov
,
who
seeks
to
win
her
back
through
blackmail
.

She
rejects
both
men
in
favour
of
Raskolnikov
's
loyal
friend
,
Razumikhin
.

Pulkheria
Alexandrovna
Raskolnikova
(
Пульхерия
Александровна
Раскольникова
)
–
Raskolnikov
's
relatively
clueless
,
hopeful
and
loving
mother
.

Following
Raskolnikov
's
sentence
,
she
falls
ill
(
mentally
and
physically
)
and
eventually
dies
.

She
hints
in
her
dying
stages
that
she
is
slightly
more
aware
of
her
son
's
fate
,
which
was
hidden
from
her
by
Dunya
and
Razumikhin
.

Dmitri
Prokofich
Razumikhin
(
Дмитрий
Прокофьич
Разумихин
)
–
Raskolnikov
's
loyal
friend
.

In
terms
of
Razumikhin
's
contribution
to
Dostoyevsky
's
anti-radical
thematics
,
he
is
intended
to
represent
something
of
a
reconciliation
of
the
pervasive
thematic
conflict
between
faith
and
reason
.

The
fact
that
his
name
means
reason
shows
Dostoyevsky
's
desire
to
employ
this
faculty
as
a
foundational
basis
for
his
Christian
faith
in
God
.

Other
characters
of
the
novel
are
:
Structure
Crime
and
Punishment
has
a
distinct
beginning
,
middle
and
end
.

The
novel
is
divided
into
six
parts
,
with
an
epilogue
.

The
notion
of
"
intrinsic
duality
"
in
Crime
and
Punishment
has
been
commented
upon
,
with
the
suggestion
that
there
is
a
degree
of
symmetry
to
the
book
.

Edward
Wasiolek
who
has
argued
that
Dostoyevsky
was
a
skilled
craftsman
,
highly
conscious
of
the
formal
pattern
in
his
art
,
has
likened
the
structure
of
Crime
and
Punishment
to
a
"
flattened
X
"
,
saying
:
This
compositional
balance
is
achieved
by
means
of
the
symmetrical
distribution
of
certain
key
episodes
throughout
the
novel
's
six
parts
.

The
recurrence
of
these
episodes
in
the
two
halves
of
the
novel
,
as
David
Bethea
has
argued
,
is
organized
according
to
a
mirror-like
principle
,
whereby
the
"
left
"
half
of
the
novel
reflects
the
"
right
"
half
.

For
her
part
,
Margaret
Church
discerns
a
contrapuntal
structuring
:
parts
I
,
III
and
V
deal
largely
with
the
main
hero
's
relationship
to
his
family
(
mother
,
sister
and
mother
surrogates
)
,
while
parts
II
,
IV
and
VI
deal
with
his
relationship
to
the
authorities
of
the
state
"
and
to
various
father
figures
"
.

The
seventh
part
of
the
novel
,
the
Epilogue
,
has
attracted
much
attention
and
controversy
.

Some
of
Dostoyevsky
's
critics
have
criticized
the
novel
's
final
pages
as
superfluous
,
anti-climactic
,
unworthy
of
the
rest
of
the
work
,
while
others
have
rushed
to
the
defense
of
the
Epilogue
,
offering
various
ingenious
schemes
which
conclusively
prove
its
inevitability
and
necessity
.

Steven
Cassedy
argues
that
Crime
and
Punishment
"
is
formally
two
distinct
but
closely
related
,
things
,
namely
a
particular
type
of
tragedy
in
the
classical
Greek
mold
and
a
Christian
resurrection
tale
"
.

Cassedy
concludes
that
"
the
logical
demands
of
the
tragic
model
as
such
are
satisfied
without
the
Epilogue
in
Crime
and
Punishment
...
At
the
same
time
,
this
tragedy
contains
a
Christian
component
,
and
the
logical
demands
of
this
element
are
met
only
by
the
resurrection
promised
in
the
Epilogue
"
.

Crime
and
Punishment
is
written
from
a
third-person
omniscient
perspective
.

It
is
focalized
primarily
from
the
point
of
view
of
Raskolnikov
;
however
,
it
does
at
times
switch
to
the
perspective
of
Svidrigailov
,
Razumikhin
,
Peter
Petrovich
,
or
Dunya
.

This
narrative
technique
,
which
fuses
the
narrator
very
closely
with
the
consciousness
and
point
of
view
of
the
central
characters
of
the
plot
,
was
original
for
its
period
.

Franks
notes
that
his
identification
,
through
Dostoyevsky
's
use
of
the
time
shifts
of
memory
and
his
manipulation
of
temporal
sequence
,
begins
to
approach
the
later
experiments
of
Henry
James
,
Joseph
Conrad
,
Virginia
Woolf
,
and
James
Joyce
.

A
late
nineteenth-century
reader
was
,
however
,
accustomed
to
more
orderly
and
linear
types
of
expository
narration
.

This
led
to
the
persistence
of
the
legend
that
Dostoyevsky
was
an
untidy
and
negligent
craftsman
and
to
critical
observations
like
the
following
by
Melchior
de
Vogüé
:
Dostoevsky
uses
different
speech
mannerisms
and
sentences
of
different
length
for
different
characters
.

Those
who
use
artificial
language
—
Luzhin
,
for
example
—
are
identified
as
unattractive
people
.

Mrs.
Marmeladov
's
disintegrating
mind
is
reflected
in
her
language
,
too
.

In
the
original
Russian
text
,
the
names
of
the
major
characters
have
something
of
a
double
meaning
,
but
in
translation
the
subtlety
of
the
Russian
language
is
predominately
always
lost
due
to
the
major
differences
in
the
language
structure
and
culture
.

For
example
,
the
original
title
(
"
Преступление
и
наказание
"
)
is
not
the
direct
equivalent
to
the
English
.
"

Преступление
"
is
literally
translated
as
a
stepping
across
.

The
physical
image
of
crime
as
a
crossing
over
a
barrier
or
a
boundary
is
lost
in
translation
.

So
is
the
religious
implication
of
transgression
,
which
in
English
refers
to
a
sin
rather
than
a
crime
.

Symbolism
Dreams
Raskolnikov
's
dreams
have
a
symbolic
meaning
,
which
suggests
a
psychological
view
.

The
dream
of
the
mare
being
whipped
has
been
suggested
as
the
fullest
single
expression
of
the
whole
novel
,
symbolizing
gratification
and
punishment
,
contemptible
motives
and
contemptible
society
,
depicting
the
nihilistic
destruction
of
an
unfit
mare
,
the
gratification
therein
,
and
Rodion
's
disgust
and
horror
,
as
an
example
of
his
conflicted
character
.

Raskolnikov
's
disgust
and
horror
is
central
to
the
theme
of
his
conflicted
character
,
his
guilty
conscience
,
his
contempt
for
society
,
his
rationality
of
himself
as
an
Overman
above
greater
society
,
holding
authority
to
kill
,
and
his
concept
of
justified
murder
.

His
reaction
is
pivotal
,
provoking
his
first
taking
of
life
toward
the
rationalization
of
himself
as
above
greater
society
.

The
dream
is
later
mentioned
when
Raskolnikov
talks
to
Marmeladov
.

Marmeladov
's
daughter
,
chaste
and
morally
devoted
Sonya
,
must
earn
a
living
as
a
sex
worker
for
their
impoverished
family
,
the
result
of
his
alcoholism
.

The
dream
is
also
a
warning
,
foreshadowing
an
impending
murder
and
holds
several
comparisons
to
his
murder
of
the
pawnbroker
.

There
may
be
greater
symbolism
but
it
is
a
point
of
scholarly
contention
and
holds
little
water
than
what
the
dream
of
a
wretched
old
mare
,
attempting
to
pull
a
dray
cart
first
from
the
left
,
and
then
from
the
right
,
and
the
hardship
she
suffers
impresses
upon
the
reader
.

In
the
final
pages
,
Raskolnikov
,
who
at
this
point
is
in
the
prison
infirmary
,
has
a
feverish
dream
about
a
plague
of
nihilism
,
that
enters
Russia
and
Europe
from
the
east
and
which
spreads
senseless
dissent
(
Raskolnikov
's
name
alludes
to
"
raskol
"
,
dissent
)
and
fanatic
dedication
to
"
new
ideas
"
:
it
finally
engulfs
all
of
mankind
.

Though
we
do
n't
learn
anything
about
the
content
of
these
ideas
they
clearly
disrupt
society
forever
and
are
seen
as
exclusively
critical
assaults
on
ordinary
thinking
:
it
is
clear
that
Dostoyevsky
was
envisaging
the
new
,
politically
and
culturally
nihilist
ideas
which
were
entering
Russian
literature
and
society
in
this
watershed
decade
and
with
which
Dostoyevsky
would
be
in
debate
for
the
rest
of
his
life
(

Russian
classics

this
final
dream

.

Cross
Sonya
gives
Rodya
a
cross
when
he
goes
to
turn
himself
in
and
symbolizes
the
burden
Raskolnikov
must
bear
.

Sonya
tells
him
they
will
bear
the
cross
together
and
is
taking
part
of
his
burden
onto
herself
,
encouraging
him
to
confess
.

Sonya
and
Lizaveta

exchanged
crosses

the
cross
was

's
—
,
whom
Rodya
did

intend
to
kill
,
becoming
an
important
symbol
of
redemption
.

Sonya
's

reminds
him

with
poverty
,
is
a
larger
theme
of
the
novel
.

The
desperation
of
poverty
creates
a
situation
where
the
only
way
to
survive
is
through
self-sacrifice
,
which
Raskolnikov
consistently
rejects
,
as
part
of
his
philosophical
reasoning
.

For
example
,
he
rejects
Razumikhin
's
offer
of
employment
and
the
idea
of
his
sister
's
arranged
marriage
.

Raskolnikov
originally
rejects
Sonya
's
offer
to
accompany
him
to
the
confession
but
,
in
a
feverish
state
of
mind
,
sees
her
following
him
through
the
market
,
and
finds
power
in
that
idealism
.

Saint
Petersburg
The
above
opening
sentence
of
the
novel
has
a
symbolic
function
:
Russian
critic
Vadim
K.
Kozhinov
argues
that
the
reference
to
the
"
exceptionally
hot
evening
"
establishes
not
only
the
suffocating
atmosphere
of
Saint
Petersburg
in
midsummer
but
also
"
the
infernal
ambience
of
the
crime
itself
"
.

Dostoyevsky
was
among
the
first
to
recognize
the
symbolic
possibilities
of
city
life
and
imagery
drawn
from
the
city
.

I.
F.
I.
Evnin
regards
Crime
and
Punishment
as
the
first
great
Russian
novel
"
in
which
the
climactic
moments
of
the
action
are
played
out
in
dirty
taverns
,
on
the
street
,
in
the
sordid
black
rooms
of
the
poor
"
.

Dostoyevsky
's
Petersburg
is
the
city
of
unrelieved
poverty
;
"
magnificence
has
no
place
in
it
,
because
magnificence
is
external
,
formal
abstract
,
cold
"
.

Dostoyevsky
connects
the
city
's
problems
to
Raskolnikov
's
thoughts
and
subsequent
actions
.

The
crowded
streets
and
squares
,
the
shabby
houses
and
taverns
,
the
noise
and
stench
,
all
are
transformed
by
Dostoyevsky
into
a
rich
store
of
metaphors
for
states
of
mind
.

Donald
Fanger
asserts
that
"
the
real
city
[
...
]
rendered
with
a
striking
concreteness
,
is
also
a
city
of
the
mind
in
the
way
that
its
atmosphere
answers
Raskolnikov
's
state
and
almost
symbolizes
it
.

It
is
crowded
,
stifling
,
and
parched
.
"

The
inner
turmoil
suffered
by
Raskolnikov
can
also
be
perceived
as
a
Shakespearean
pathetic
fallacy
.

For
example
,
the
great
storm
in
King
Lear
reflects
the
state
of
the
King
's
mind
,
much
like
the
chaos
,
disorder
and
noise
of
St.
Petersburg
reflects
the
state
of
Raskolnikov
's
mind
.

Yellow
The
colour
yellow
is
used
throughout
the
novel
to
signify
suffering
and
mental
illness
.

Examples
include
Sonya
's
yellow
ticket
,
a
license
to
practice
prostitution
,
the
walls
of
Raskolnikov
's
garret
,
and
the
walls
of
the
old
pawnbroker
,
among
numerous
other
examples
.

Of
note
,
the
Russian
term
for
lunatic
asylum
,
"
zholti
dom
"
,
is
literally
translated
as
"
yellow
house
"
.

Themes
Dostoyevsky
's
letter
to
Katkov
reveals
his
immediate
inspiration
,
to
which
he
remained
faithful
even
after
his
original
plan
evolved
into
a
much
more
ambitious
creation
:
a
desire
to
counteract
what
he
regarded
as
nefarious
consequences
arising
from
the
doctrines
of
Russian
nihilism
.

In
the
novel
,
Dostoyevsky
pinpointed
the
dangers
of
both
utilitarianism
and
rationalism
,
the
main
ideas
of
which
inspired
the
radicals
,
continuing
a
fierce
criticism
he
had
already
started
with
his
Notes
from
Underground
.

A
Slavophile
religious
believer
,
Dostoyevsky
utilized
the
characters
,
dialogue
and
narrative
in
Crime
and
Punishment
to
articulate
an
argument
against
westernizing
ideas
in
general
.

He
thus
attacked
a
peculiar
Russian
blend
of
French
utopian
socialism
and
Benthamite
utilitarianism
,
which
had
led
to
what
revolutionaries
,
such
as
Nikolai
Chernyshevsky
,
called
"
rational
egoism
"
.

The
radicals
refused
,
however
,
to
recognize
themselves
in
the
novel
's
pages
(
Dimitri
Pisarev
ridiculed
the
notion
that
Raskolnikov
's
ideas
could
be
identified
with
those
of
the
radicals
of
his
time
)
,
since
Dostoyevsky
pursued
nihilistic
ideas
to
their
most
extreme
consequences
.

The
aim
of
these
ideas
was
altruistic
and
humanitarian
,
but
these
aims
were
to
be
achieved
by
relying
on
reason
and
suppressing
entirely
the
spontaneous
outflow
of
Christian
pity
and
compassion
.

Chernyshevsky
's
utilitarian
ethic
proposed
that
thought
and
will
in
Man
were
subject
to
the
laws
of
physical
science
.

Dostoyevsky
believed
that
such
ideas
limited
man
to
a
product
of
physics
,
chemistry
and
biology
,
negating
spontaneous
emotional
responses
.

In
its
latest
variety
of
Bazarovism
,
Russian
nihilism
encouraged
the
creation
of
an
élite
of
superior
individuals
to
whom
the
hopes
of
the
future
were
to
be
entrusted
.

Raskolnikov
exemplifies
all
the
potentially
disastrous
hazards
contained
in
such
an
ideal
.

Frank
notes
that
"
the
moral-psychological
traits
of
his
character
incorporate
this
antinomy
between
instinctive
kindness
,
sympathy
,
and
pity
on
the
one
hand
and
,
on
the
other
,
a
proud
and
idealistic
egoism
that
has
become
perverted
into
a
contemptuous
disdain
for
the
submissive
herd
"
.

Raskolnikov
's
inner
conflict
in
the
opening
section
of
the
novel
results
in
a
utilitarian-altruistic
justification
for
the
proposed
crime
:
why
not
kill
a
wretched
and
"
useless
"
old
moneylender
to
alleviate
the
human
misery
?

Dostoyevsky
wants
to
show
that
this
utilitarian
type
of
reasoning
and
its
conclusions
had
become
widespread
and
commonplace
;
they
were
by
no
means
the
solitary
invention
of
Raskolnikov
's
tormented
and
disordered
mind
.

Such
radical
and
utilitarian
ideas
act
to
reinforce
the
innate
egoism
of
Raskolnikov
's
character
and
,
likewise
,
contempt
for
the
lower
qualities
in
Man
and
for
His
ideals
.

He
even
becomes
fascinated
with
the
majestic
image
of
a
Napoleonic
personality
who
,
in
the
interests
of
a
higher
social
good
,
believes
that
he
possesses
a
moral
right
to
kill
.

Indeed
,
his
"
Napoleon-like
"
plan
drags
him
to
a
well-calculated
murder
,
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
his
self-deception
with
utilitarianism
.

In
his
depiction
of
the
Petersburg
background
,
Dostoyevsky
accentuates
the
squalor
and
human
wretchedness
that
pass
before
Raskolnikov
's
eyes
.

He
also
uses
Raskolnikov
's
encounter
with
Marmeladov
to
present
both
the
heartlessness
of
Raskolnikov
's
convictions
and
the
alternative
set
of
values
to
be
set
against
them
.

Dostoyevsky
believes
that
the
"
freedom
"
propounded
by
the
aforementioned
ideas
is
a
dreadful
freedom
"
that
is
contained
by
no
values
,
because
it
is
before
values
"
.

The
product
of
this
"
freedom
"
,
Raskolnikov
,
is
in
perpetual
revolt
against
society
,
himself
,
and
God
.

He
thinks
that
he
is
self-sufficient
and
self-contained
,
but
at
the
end
"
his
boundless
self-confidence
must
disappear
in
the
face
of
what
is
greater
than
himself
,
and
his
self-fabricated
justification
must
humble
itself
before
the
higher
justice
of
God
"
.

Dostoyevsky
calls
for
the
regeneration
and
renewal
of
the
"
sick
"
Russian
society
through
the
re-discovering
of
their
country
,
their
religion
,
and
their
roots
.

Reception
The
first
part
of
Crime
and
Punishment
published
in
the
January
and
February
issues
of
The
Russian
Messenger
met
with
public
success
.

Although
the
remaining
parts
of
the
novel
had
still
to
be
written
,
an
anonymous
reviewer
wrote
that
"
the
novel
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
works
of
the
author
of
The
House
of
the
Dead
"
.

In
his
memoirs
,
the
conservative
belletrist
Nikolay
Strakhov
recalled
that
in
Russia
Crime
and
Punishment
was
the
literary
sensation
of
0000
.

The
novel
soon
attracted
the
criticism
of
the
liberal
and
radical
critics
.

G.Z.
Yeliseyev
sprang
to
the
defense
of
the
Russian
student
corporations
,
and
wondered
,
"
Has
there
ever
been
a
case
of
a
student
committing
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
?
"

Pisarev
,
aware
of
the
novel
's
artistic
value
attempted
in
0000
another
approach
:
he
argued
that
Raskolnikov
was
a
product
of
his
environment
,
and
explained
that
the
main
theme
of
the
work
was
poverty
and
its
results
.

He
measured
the
novel
's
excellence
by
the
accuracy
and
understanding
with
which
Dostoyevsky
portrayed
the
contemporary
social
reality
,
and
focused
on
what
he
regarded
as
inconsistencies
in
the
novel
's
plot
.

Strakhov
rejected
Pisarev
's
contention
that
the
theme
of
environmental
determinism
was
essential
to
the
novel
,
and
pointed
out
that
Dostoyevsky
's
attitude
towards
his
hero
was
sympathetic
:
"
This
is
not
mockery
of
the
younger
generation
,
neither
a
reproach
nor
an
accusation
—
it
is
a
lament
over
it
.
"

History
Montrose
was
laid
out
in

The
first
courthouse
was
built
a
year
later
,
and
Montrose
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
from
part
of
Bridgewater
Township
on
March

,
0000
.

Its
name
is
a
combination
of
"
mont
"
,
the
French
word
for
“
mountain
”
and
Rose
,
for
Dr.
L
R.
Rose
,
a
prominent
citizen
.

The
traditional
older
industries
included
creameries
and
the
manufacturing
of
cut
glass
,
boxes
,
sawing
machinery
,
lumber
,
etc.
.

The

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Susquehanna
County
.

The
area
of
Montrose
is
notable
for
its
many
quarry
sites
.

A
type
of
rock
that
is
indigenous
to
this
area
is
called
blue
stone
.

The
town
,
along
with
Susquehanna
County
,
is
best
known
as
the
location
of
significant
Marcellus
shale
drilling
,
putting
Montrose
in
the
center
of
the
bourgeoning
natural
gas
industry
.

Montrose
was
incorporated
as
a
town
and
seat
of
Susquehanna
County
in
0000
,
but
families
began
immigrating
to
the
area
in
the
mid
Eighteenth
Century
,
primarily
from
areas
along
the
Connecticut
River
Valley
(
western
Connecticut
,
Massachusetts
,
and
Vermont
)
.

The
American
Revolution
dramatically
changed
the
political
and
built
environments
of
New
England
,
and
consequentially
,
many
inhabitants
desired
vast
and
affordable
land
in
the
western
lands
of
Pennsylvania
.

When
settlers
arrived
in
what
is
now
Susquehanna
County
they
found
rolling
hills
,
clear
lakes
,
and
mountain
streams
with
an
abundance
of
natural
resources
like
timber
and
bluestone
.

In
a
very
short
period
of
time
,
the
first
families
built
Montrose
like
familiar
New
England
towns
–
large
colonial
style
houses
surrounding
churches
with
a
main
street
straddling
the
town
.

A
town
“
green
”
adjacent
to
the
courthouse
allowed
for
community
events
,
a
spirit
that
still
carries
on
to
the
present
day
.

Arguably
,
the
most
mystified
(
and
thus
contested
)
aspect
of
the
town
’s
history
occurred
during
the
height
of
America
’s
Civil
War
.

Several
townsfolk
and
local
historians
claim
that
Montrose
played
a
significant
role
in
the
Northern
Trail
of
the
Underground
Railroad
,
housing
several
slave
families
in
the
area
.

Folklore
has
it
that
many
of
these
families
remained
in
Montrose
and
across
the
county
after
the
War
.

These
supposed
connections
opened
a
floodgate
of
local
residents
seeking
historical
landmark
status
for
their
homes
in
the
twentieth
and
twenty-first
centuries
,
many
of
which
were
denied
by
the
Pennsylvania
Historical
Commission
due
to
lack
of
evidence
that
the
events
actually
took
place
.

Several
academic
historians
believe
that
,
while
the
possibility
of
a
family
or
two
stopping
in
Montrose
along
the
Northern
Trail
is
certainly
plausible
,
the
number
of
increased
African
Americans
during
the
time
is
most
likely
explained
by
the
then-bourgeoning
coal
industry
just
south
of
the
county
that
appealed
to
many
immigrants
and
former
slaves
looking
for
work
.

The
Susquehanna
County
Historical
Society
and
the
Center
for
Anti-Slavery
Studies
(
housed
in
one
of
the
suspected
homes
)
remains
dedicated
to
identifying
and
analyzing
primary
documents
of
the
time
,
but
little
legitimate
data
exists
to
satisfy
the
burdens
of
the
Underground
Railroad
claims
.

The
Sylvanus
Mulford
House
,
Silver
Lake
Bank
,
and
Susquehanna
County
Courthouse
Complex
are
listed
on
the
National
Register
of

The
Montrose
Historic

in

A
jigsaw
puzzle
is
a
tiling
puzzle
that
requires
the
assembly
of
numerous
small
,
often
oddly
shaped
,
interlocking
and
tessellating
pieces
.

Each
piece
usually
has
a
small
part
of
a
picture
on
it
;
when
complete
,
a
jigsaw
puzzle
produces
a
complete
picture
.

In
some
cases
more
advanced
types
have
appeared
on
the
market
,
such
as
spherical
jigsaws
and
puzzles
showing
optical
illusions
.

Jigsaw
puzzles
were
originally
created
by
painting
a
picture
on
a
flat
,
rectangular
piece
of
wood
,
and
then
cutting
that
picture
into
small
pieces
with
a
jigsaw
,
hence
the
name
.

John
Spilsbury
,
a
London
mapmaker
and
engraver
,
is
credited
with
commercializing
jigsaw
puzzles
around
0000
.

Jigsaw
puzzles
have
since
come
to
be
made
primarily
on
cardboard
.

Typical
images
found
on
jigsaw
puzzles
include
scenes
from
nature
,
building
s
,
and
repetitive
designs
.

Castle
s
and
mountain
s
are
two
traditional
subjects
.

However
,
any
kind
of
picture
can
be
used
to
make
a
jigsaw
puzzle
;
some
companies
offer
to
turn
personal
photographs
into
puzzles
.

Completed
puzzles
can
also
be
attached
to
a
backing
with
adhesive
to
be
used
as
artwork
.

During
recent
years
a
range
of
jigsaw
puzzle
accessories
including
boards
,
cases
,
frames
and
roll-up
mats
has
become
available
that
are
designed
to
assist
jigsaw
puzzle
enthusiasts
.

Some
jigsaw
enthusiasts
suggest
that
it
is
bad
form
(
against
the
rules
)
to
look
at
the
picture
on
the
box
while
working
on
the
puzzle
,
but
most
people
find
it
to
be
perfectly
normal
to
look
at
the
box
.

Construction
Most
modern
jigsaw
puzzles
are
made
out
of
cardboard
,
since
they
are
easier
and
cheaper
to
mass-produce
than
the
original
wooden
models
.

An
enlarged
photograph
or
printed
reproduction
of
a
painting
or
other
two-dimensional
art
work
is
glued
onto
the
cardboard
before
cutting
.

This
board
is
then
fed
into
a
press
.

The
press
forces
a
set
of
hardened
steel
blades
of
the
desired
shape
through
the
board
until
it
is
fully
cut
.

This
procedure
is
similar
to
making
shaped
cookies
with
a
cookie
cutter
.

The
forces
involved
,
however
,
are
tremendously
greater
and
a
typical
0000-piece
puzzle
requires
a
press
that
can
generate
upwards
of
000
tons
of
force
to
push
the
knives
of
the
puzzle
die
through
the
board
.

A
puzzle
die
is
a
flat
board
,
often
made
from
plywood
,
which
has
slots
cut
or
burned
in
the
same
shape
as
the
knives
that
are
used
.

These
knives
are
set
into
the
slots
and
covered
in
a
compressible
material
,
typically
foam
rubber
,
which
serves
to
eject
the
cut
puzzle
pieces
.

Beginning
in
the
0000s
,
jigsaw
puzzles
were
cut
using
large
hydraulic
presses
which
now
cost
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
.

The
cuts
gave
a
very
snug
fit
,
but
the
cost
limited
jigsaw
puzzle
manufacture
only
to
large
corporations
.

Recent
roller
press
design
achieve
the
same
effect
,
at
a
lower
cost
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
Tower
Press
was
the
world
's
largest
maker
of
jigsaw
puzzles
,
acquired
by
Waddingtons
in
0000
.

New
technology
has
enabled
laser-cutting
of
wooden
jigsaw
puzzles
,
which
is
a
growing
segment
of
the
high-end
jigsaw
puzzle
market
.

Variations
Jigsaw
puzzles
typically
come
in
000-piece
,
000-piece
,
000-piece
,
and
0,000-piece
sizes
;
however
the
largest
commercial
puzzle
has
00,000
pieces
and
spans
000
cm
by
000
cm
.

The
most
common
layout
for
a
thousand-piece
puzzle
is
00
pieces
by
00
pieces
,
for
a
total
count
of
0,000
pieces
.

The
majority
of
000-piece
puzzles
are
00
pieces
by
00
pieces
.

Children
's
jigsaw
puzzles
come
in
a
great
variety
of
sizes
,
rated
by
the
number
of
pieces
.

A
few
puzzles
are
made
double-sided
,
so
that
they
can
be
solved
from
either
side
.

This
adds
a
level
of
complexity
,
because
it
can
not
be
certain
that
the
correct
side
of
the
piece
is
being
viewed
and
assembled
with
the
other
pieces
.

There
are
also
Family
Puzzles
,
which
come
in
000-piece
with
three
different
sized
pieces
from
large
to
small
.

The
pieces
are
placed
from
large
to
small
going
in
one
direction
or
towards
the
middle
of
the
puzzle
.

This
allows
a
family
or
puzzlers
of
different
skill
levels
and
different
size
hands
to
work
on
the
puzzle
at
the
same
time
.

Companies
like
Springbok
,
Cobble
Hill
,
Ravensburger
,
and
Suns
Out
make
this
type
of
specialty
puzzle
.

There
are
also
three-dimensional
jigsaw
puzzles
.

Many
of
these
are
made
of
wood
or
styrofoam
and
require
the
puzzle
to
be
solved
in
a
certain
order
;
some
pieces
will
not
fit
in
if
others
are
already
in
place
.

Also
common
are
puzzle
boxes
:
simple
three-dimensional
jigsaw
puzzles
with
a
small
drawer
or
box
in
the
center
for
storage
.

Another
type
of
jigsaw
puzzle
,
which
is
considered
a
0-D
puzzle
,
is
a
puzzle
globe
.

Like
a
0-D
puzzle
,
a
globe
puzzle
is
often
made
of
plastic
and
the
assembled
pieces
form
a
single
layer
.

But
the
final
form
is
a
three-dimensional
shape
.

Most
globe
puzzles
have
designs
representing
spherical
shapes
such
as
the
Earth
,
the
Moon
,
and
historical
globes
of
the
Earth
.

There
are
also
computer
versions
of
jigsaw
puzzles
,
which
have
the
advantages
of
requiring
zero
cleanup
as
well
as
no
risk
of
losing
any
pieces
.

Many
computer-based
jigsaw
puzzles
do
not
allow
pieces
to
be
rotated
,
so
all
pieces
are
displayed
in
their
correct
orientation
.

These
puzzles
are
thus
considerably
easier
than
a
physical
jigsaw
puzzle
with
the
same
number
of
pieces
.

Puzzle
pieces
Many
puzzles
are
termed
"
fully
interlocking
"
.

This
means
that
adjacent
pieces
are
connecting
such
that
if
you
move
one
piece
horizontally
you
move
all
,
preserving
the
connection
.

Sometimes
the
connection
is
tight
enough
to
pick
up
a
solved
part
holding
one
piece
.

Some
fully
interlocking
puzzles
have
pieces
all
of
a
similar
shape
,
with
rounded
tabs
out
on
opposite
ends
,
with
corresponding
blanks
cut
into
the
intervening
sides
to
receive
the
tabs
of
adjacent
pieces
.

Other
fully
interlocking
puzzles
may
have
tabs
and
blanks
variously
arranged
on
each
piece
,
but
they
usually
have
four
sides
,
and
the
numbers
of
tabs
and
blanks
thus
add
up
to
four
.

The
uniform-shaped
fully
interlocking
puzzles
are
the
most
difficult
,
because
the
differences
in
shapes
between
pieces
can
be
very
subtle
.

Some
puzzles
also
have
pieces
with
non-interlocking
sides
that
are
usually
slightly
curved
in
complex
curves
.

These
are
actually
the
easiest
puzzles
to
solve
,
since
fewer
other
pieces
are
potential
candidates
for
mating
.

Most
jigsaw
puzzles
are
square
,
rectangular
,
or
round
,
with
edge
pieces
that
have
one
side
that
is
either
straight
or
smoothly
curved
to
create
this
shape
,
plus
four
corner
pieces
if
the
puzzle
is
square
or
rectangular
.

Some
jigsaw
puzzles
have
edge
pieces
that
are
cut
just
like
all
the
rest
of
the
interlocking
pieces
,
with
no
smooth
edge
,
to
make
them
more
challenging
.

Other
puzzles
are
designed
so
the
shape
of
the
whole
puzzle
forms
a
figure
,
such
as
an
animal
.

The
edge
pieces
may
vary
more
in
these
cases
.

Potential
Alzheimer
's
prevention
According
to
the
Alzheimer
Society
of
Canada
,
doing
jigsaw
puzzles
is
one
of
many
activities
that
can
help
keep
the
brain
active
and
may
contribute
to
reducing
the
risk
of
developing
Alzheimer

now
has
many
small

were
building
the
Williamson
Road
from
Williamsport
,
in
Lycoming
County
,
to
Painted
Post
in
New
York
under
the
leadership
of
Robert
and
Benjamin
Patterson
discovered
coal
within
the
present
town
limits
of
Blossburg
.

When
the
group
reached
the
Tioga
River
,
they
established
a
supply
camp
upon
its
banks
.

In
0000
,
Aaron
Bloss
moved
to
Tioga
County
and
in
0000
,
moved
to
the
area
known
as
"
Peter
’s
Camp
"
.

He
is
considered
the
first
settler
of
Blossburg
.

Sometime
between
0000
and
0000
,
Aaron
Bloss
made
the
first
attempt
to
found
a
town
by
changing
the
name
of
Peter
’s
Camp
to
Blossburg
.

Blossburg
was
finally
recognized
and
incorporated
a
borough
in
August
0000
.

The
real
mining
history
of
Blossburg
Coal
began
shortly
after
0000
when
David
Clemens
made
the
first
effort
to
mine
and
market
coal
.

Clemens
opened
a
mine
on
Bear
Run
between
0000
and
0000
,
serving
only
the
Painted
Post
area
.

Around
the
same
time
a
lower
vein
was
opened
on
Bear
Run
by
Aaron
Bloss
.

This
vein
is
known
as
the
Bloss
Vein
but
was
used
only
to
satisfy
local
demands
.

The
first
efforts
of
coal
shipping
were
on
a
small
scale
due
to
the
poor
road
conditions
and
the
poor
navigating
ability
along
the
Tioga
River
.

In
0000
,
a
coalition
of
Bloss
and
the
other
miners
asked
the
legislature
for
funds
to
improve
these
routes
.

In
the
meantime
,
Blossburg
Coal
was
being
shipped
to
Painted
Post
,
Elmira
,
and
Corning
.

More
important
than
the
local
runs
,
Blossburg
Coal
was
being
shipped
to
Albany
where
it
influenced
railroad
and
canal
navigation
legislation
,
and
also
to
Philadelphia
where
it
attracted
the
enterprising
businessmen
.

In
0000
,
Judge
John
H.
Knapp
erected
an
iron
ore
smelting
works
within
the
borough
limits
.

Knapp
also
opened
coal
mines
on
Coal
Run
and
ore
mines
on
"
Barney
Hill
"
.

In
July
0000
,
the
railroad
found
its
way
through
Covington
from
Corning
,
and
was
opened
for
locomotives
to
Blossburg
in
September
.

This
railroad
allowed
the
mines
to
be
tapped
and
for
their
coal
to
be
easily
distributed
through
the
Twin
Tiers
.

For
more
than
000
years
,
coal
has
played
a
vital
role
in
the
development
of
Blossburg
.

Today
many
of
the
mines
that
still
exist
are
dormant
.

However
Ward
Manufacturing
is
a
descendant
of
the
Blossburg
Coal
mining
industry
and
is
currently
the
largest
business
operating
in
the
Blossburg
area
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
Mohawk
Airlines
Flight
00
crashed
outside
of
Blossburg
with
a
loss
of
all
00
passengers
and
crew
.

Flight
00
was
a
regularly
scheduled
passenger
flight
between
Elmira
,
New
York
and
Washington
,
DC
.

The
aircraft
was
a

Elkland
Borough
In
0000
the
township
of
Elkland
,
was
organized
.

Its
territory
,
taken
from
Delmar
Township
,
extended
along
the
New
York
state
line
from
the
ninety-third
to
the
one
hundred
and
fourth
mile-stone
—
a
distance
of
eleven
miles
(
00
km
)
.

It
extended
north
and
south
a
distance
of
ten
miles
(
00
km
)
and
embraced
within
its
boundaries
the
present
borough
of
Elkland
and
townships
of
Nelson
,
Osceola
,
all
of
Farmington
,
and
parts
of
Lawrence
,
Deerfield
,
and
Middlebury
townships
.

In
December
0000
,
a
part
of
the
township
of
Lawrence
was
taken
from
it
,
and
in
September
0000
,
another
portion
of
its
territory
went
to
Middlebury
township
.

In
February
0000
,
the
territory
of
the
township
of
Farmington
was
taken
from
it
.

Those
several
reductions
confined
it
to
a
narrow
strip
,
about
eight
miles
(
00
km
)
long
,
from
east
to
west
,
by
two
and
three-fourths
miles
wide
,
from
north
to
south
.

By
an
act
of
the
legislature
,
approved
April
00
,
0000
,
its
territory
was
still
further
reduced
by
the
creation
of
the
borough
of
Elkland
,
to
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
additions
have
been
made
.

In
January
0000
,
all
that
part
of
the
township
not
embraced
in
Elkland
borough
limits
,
lying
west
of
a
line
extending
through
the
center
of
that
borough
,
from
north
to
south
,
was
erected
into
the
township
of
Osceola
,
and
in
December
0000
,
all
lying
east
of
the
same
line
became
the
township
of
Nelson
,
and
Elkland
township
passed
out
of
existence
.

By
the
subsequent
extension
of
the
Elkland
borough
limits
south
of
the
Cowanesque
river
,
the
townships
of
Osceola
and
Nelson
both
suffered
material
reductions
of
area
.

There
is
still
left
,
however
,
a
narrow
strip
between
the
southern
boundary
of
Elkland
and
the
northern
boundary
Farmington
township
,
the
western
half
of
which
belongs
to
Osceola
Township
,
and
the
eastern
half
to
the
township
of
Nelson
.

Some
years
ago
a
movement
was
afoot
to
annex
this
strip
to
Elkland
borough
and
thus
give
it
and
Osceola
and
Nelson
townships
more
symmetrical
boundaries
,
but
for
some
reason
the
annexation
was
not
made
.

Pioneer
Settlers
A
man
named
Baker
Pierce
,
who
died
in
0000
,
and
whose
remains
were
buried
in
the
old
pioneer
graveyard
at
Osceola
,
appears
to
have
been
the
first
settler
within
the
boundaries
of
Elkland
borough
.

Just
when
he
settled
or
how
long
he
remained
can
not
now
be
ascertained
,
but
it
must
have
been
during
the
earlier
years
of
the
first
decade
of
the
present
century
.

The
next
to
settle
was
the
Taylor
family
,
who
located
at
Barney
Hill
.

The
family
consisted
of
Mrs.
Permelia
Taylor
and
her
three
sons
,
Ebenezer
,
Philip
and
Mitchell
,
who
emigrated
from
the
Delaware
Water
Gap
,
New
Jersey
,
to
the
Wyoming
valley
,
thence
to
Pipe
Creek
,
below
Owego
,
from
which
place
,
in
0000
,
they
came
to
the
Cowanesque
valley
.

Ebenezer
and
Philip
soon
afterward
removed
to
Osceola
.

The
latter
,
his
mother
and
his
brother
,
Mitchell
,
all
died
before
0000
,
and
were
buried
at
Barney
Hill
.

In
0000
,
their
resting
place
being
disturbed
by
the
building
of
the
Addison
and
Pennsylvania
railroad
,
Capt.
Charles
R.
Taylor
and
Charles
Tubbs
—
descendants
in
the
fourth
generation
of
Mrs.
Permelia
Taylor
—
removed
their
remains
to
the
cemetery
at
Osceola
.

It
appears
that
William
Courtright
acquired
title
to
the
land
first
bought
and
settled
on
by
Philip
Taylor
,
which
,
in
0000
,
he
conveyed
to
Lintsford
Coates
.

The
Coates
family
came
early
,
as
early
,
so
it
has
been
stated
,
as
0000
.

In
0000
,
however
,
Timothy
Coates
Sr.
acquired
the
title
to
of
land
,
situated
between
the
lands
of
Cyprian
Wright
and
those
of
Amasa
Culver
,
and
covered
by
warrant
No.
000
within
the
limits
of
what
is
now
Nelson
borough
,
and
later
he
and
his
son
,
Lintsford
,
bought
land
and
became
residents
of
Elkland
.

The
exact
year
is
,
however
,
difficult
to
ascertain
.

Daniel
Holiday
was
here
previous
to
0000
,
in
which
year
his
son
,
Daniel
,
now
a
resident
of
Holidaytown
,
Middlebury
township
,
was
born
.

In
March
0000
,
came
a
colony
from
Elmira
,
New
York
and
Southport
,
New
York
,
consisting
of
Samuel
Tubbs
Sr.
,
his
sons
,
Samuel
,
James
and
Benjamin
,
and
his
sons-in-law
,
John
Ryon
Jr.
,
David
Hammond
,
and
Martin
Stevens
.

The
members
of
this
colony
became
the
owners
and
occupants
of
all
the
land
from
Barney
Hill
on
the
east
to
the
Stull
farm
on
the
west
,
including
the
Davenport
Island
and
farm
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
.

John
Ryon
Jr.
and
his
brother
James
settled
in
the
center
of
Elkland
,
which
became
known
as
Ryonsville
.

John
Ryon
Sr.
,
who
joined
the
settlement
later
,
was
the
first
postmaster
of
the
village
and
resided
there
until
his
death
in
0000
.

John
Ryon
Jr.
early
became
a
prominent
and
leading
spirit
.

He
was
elected
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
0000
,
a
member
of
the
legislature
in
0000
and
0000
,
and
a
member
of
the
state
senate
in
0000
.

He
was
the
first
merchant
of
the
village
and
its
most
prominent
citizen
.

In
0000
,
he
removed
to
Lawrenceville
,
PA
,
where
he
died
July
00
,
0000
.

Samuel
Tubbs
settled
on
what
is
now
known
as
the
Dorrance
farm
and
soon
became
identified
with
the
material
growth
of
the
village
.

David
Hammond
settled
on
the
old
Hammond
homestead
now
owned
by
Mrs.
C.
L.
Pattison
.

The
names
given
are
those
of
the
pioneers
who
settled
within
the
borough
limits
,
so
far
as
it
has
been
possible
to
ascertain
them
.

In
time
the
village
took
the
name
of
Elkland
,
growing
steadily
year
by
year
.

it
is
now
one
of
the
most
prosperous
and
progressive
boroughs
in
the
county
.

Village
Growth
As
early
as
0000
,
Col.
Samuel
Tubbs
and
his
sons
excavated
a
mill
race
around
the
south
side
of
what
afterward
became
known
as
Davenport
Island
and
erected
a
saw-mill
and
a
grist-mill
.

Col.
Lemuel
Davenport
,
who
came
about
0000
,
or
soon
after
,
acquired
this
property
and
owned
and
operated
the
mills
.

In
0000
,
they
were
purchased
by
Hon.
John
W.
Ryon
,
of
Pottsville
,
Pennsylvania
.

In
0000
,
the
grist-mill
was
changed
to
a
roller-mill
.

In
0000
,
the
machinery
,
etc.
,
was
removed
to
a
site
north
of
the
Fall
Brook
railroad
at
the
head
of
Parkhurst
street
,
and
the
present
mill
was
erected
.

In
0000
,
a
grain
elevator
with
a
capacity
of
00,000
bushels
of
grain
was
built
.

During
the
latter
part
of
0000
,
the
mill
was
completely
remodeled
,
and
the
latest
improved
machinery
was
added
.

It
is
now
a
000-barrel
mill
and
is
one
of
the
best
equipped
in
the
State
.

John
W.
Ryon
Jr.
is
in
charge
.

William
Martindell
is
the
superintendent
and
head
miller
.

About
0000
,
D.
B.
Schoff
erected
a
water-power
saw-mill
on
the
river
in
the
southern
part
of
the
village
and
operated
it
for
a
number
of
years
.

It
was
torn
down
in
0000
by
George
Dorrance
.

The
first
store
in
the
village
was
opened
about
0000
or
0000
by
John
Ryon
Jr.
and
Robert
Tubbs
.

In
0000
,
Joel
Parkhurst
,
who
had
previously
been
in
business
with
his
brother
in
Lawrenceville
,
came
to
Elkland
,
joined
with
and
later
bought
them
out
.

He
became
within
a
few
years
,
not
only
a
leading
business
man
,
but
the
wealthiest
citizen
of
the
Cowanesque
valley
,
maintaining
at
the
same
time
a
well-deserved
reputation
for
liberality
,
enterprise
,
and
public
spirit
.

In
0000
,
George
L.
and
Samuel
Ryon
opened
a
store
and
continued
in
business
until
0000
.

About
0000
,
Timothy
S.
and
David
Coates
engaged
in
merchandising
and
lumbering
,
continuing
until
0000
,
when
Clark
Kimball
of
Osceola
,
succeeded
David
.

Other
changes
occurred
previous
to
Mr.
Coates
’s
retirement
in
0000
or
0000
.

As
the
country
became
more
settled
,
the
village
grew
slowly
,
new
stores
being
started
,
a
school
house
built
,
a
church
organized
,
and
such
other
trade
and
industrial
enterprises
set
on
foot
as
the
condition
and
necessities
of
the
people
demanded
.

In
the
winter
of
0000-00
,
James
Tubbs
,
father
of
Hon.
Charles
Tubbs
,
of
Osceola
,
and
who
is
still
living
,
taught
a
school
in
the
village
.

Recently
in
a
reminiscent
article
published
in
the
Elkland
Journal
,
he
described
this
school
and
the
pupils
who
attended
and
closed
with
the
following
description
of
the
village
:
"
At
the
time
of
my
school
Elkland
was
a
mere
hamlet
,
not
even
a
four
corners
,
as
there
was
no
street
from
Skinner
’s
store
to
the
river
.

On
what
is
now
Buffalo
street
two
families
lived
—
Anson
Blackman
’s
and
Alvinzi
Foote
’s
.

Stanley
,
the
tailor
,
had
just
occupied
the
house
in
which
Dr.
Rockwell
now
lives
.

Martin
Stevens
,
carpenter
,
and
Asaph
Johnson
lived
on
the
farm
where
the
Postal
Telegraph
Company
’s
office
is
,
and
Benjamin
Tubbs
on
the
lower
part
of
the
Dorrance
farm
.

The
leading
citizen
was
John
Ryon
.

He
had
been
representative
and
senator
,
and
at
the
time
of
my
school
had
a
seat
upon
the
bench
as
associate
judge
.

He
gave
the
land
where
the
school
house
was
built
;
the
land
for
the
cemetery
,
and
the
site
for
the
Presbyterian
church
,
which
had
then
been
built
about
one
year
.

his
son
,
John
W.
,
has
become
my
most
distinguished
scholar
,
having
been
a
member
of
Congress
.

Elisha
B.
Benedict
was
the
physician
of
the
place
,
and
Rev.
Octavius
Fitch
,
the
Presbyterian
minister
.

Joel
Parkhurst
,
who
settled
in
Elkland
eleven
years
previously
,
kept
a
store
on
the
site
of
the
Journal
office
,
and
was
the
postmaster
.

The
mail
arrived
twice
a
week
at
the
postoffice
.

There
was
no
bridge
across
the
river
.

Later
Years
The
Elkland
Tannery
was
established
about
0000
by
James
Hancock
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Cowanesque
River
.

He
was
soon
succeeded
by
S.
G.
Tabor
&
Son
.

In
0000
,
Joel
Parkhurst
acquired
the
property
,
which
he
continued
to
own
until
0000
,
when
he
sold
it
to
Joseph
Cornelius
.

He
owned
and
operated
it
in
connection
with
his
sons
until
0000
,
when
it
passed
into
the
hands
of
Proctor
,
Hunt
&
Co.
,
of
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
Mr.
Cornelius
retaining
an
interest
in
the
business
.

In
January
0000
,
the
tannery
was
destroyed
by
fire
and
rebuilt
on
the
present
site
north
of
the
Fall
Brook
railroad
,
beginning
operations
November
00
,
0000
.

Decker
&
Metcalf
’s
Sash
,
Door
and
Blind
Factory
was
established
about
0000
.

They
ran
it
nearly
twenty
years
.

The
property
had
various
owners
afterwards
,
finally
falling
into
the
hands
of
C.
L.
Pattison
who
removed
the
plant
north
of
the
railroads
and
incorporated
it
with
the
furniture
factory
.

The
Cowanesque
Valley
Oil
Company
was
incorporated
in
July
0000
,
the
incorporators
being
Garrett
W.
Benson
,
Olean
,
New
York
,
and
John
Parkhurst
,
Charles
L.
Pattison
,
Benjamin
Dorrance
,
and
J.
C.
Edwards
,
of
Elkland
.

An
oil
well
was
sunk
on
the
Hammond
place
southwest
of
the
borough
.

Oil
and
gas
were
both
found
,
but
in
limited
quantities
.

The
Elkland
Furniture
Association
(
Limited
)
was
incorporated
March
00
,
0000
,
by
Charles
L.
Pattison
,
William
L.
Simmons
and
Abram
Coon
,
with
a
capital
stock
of
$
0,000.00
.

Its
object
was
the
manufacture
and
vending
of
furniture
of
every
description
.

The
plant
was
installed
in
ample
buildings
north
of
the
railroad
,
and
a
large
business
soon
built
up
.

In
0000
,
one
hundred
hands
were
employed
.

The
factory
was
destroyed
by
fire
January
0
,
0000
.

A
movement
to
rebuild
was
immediately
set
on
foot
but
was
not
successful
.

The
Elkland
Manufacturing
Company
,
manufacturers
of
toys
and
novelties
,
was
established
in
Elkland
in
January
0000
.

Charles
W.
Crandall
,
the
superintendent
,
was
the
son
of
Charles
Martin
Crandall
,
known
as
the
maker
of
Crandall
’s
building
blocks
and
grandson
of
Asa
Crandall
who
ran
a
furniture
factory
in
Covington
in
0000
.

Mr.
Crandall
was
in
the
same
business
in
Montrose
,
Pennsylvania
,
where
his
large
factory
burned
August
00
,
0000
,
involving
a
loss
of
$
00,000
.

From
sixty
to
seventy-five
men
were
constantly
employed
,
the
annual
output
amounting
to
$
00,000
.

Toys
and
novelties
were
shipped
to
all
parts
of
the
world
.

Schools
The
early
schools
in
Elkland
,
as
in
other
places
throughout
the
county
,
were
supported
by
subscription
,
and
until
the
building
of
the
first
school
house
in
0000
,
were
taught
in
any
house
that
could
be
secured
for
the
purpose
.

The
year
when
the
first
school
was
opened
has
not
been
ascertained
,
but
it
was
probably
as
early
as
0000
or
0000
.

Among
the
first
teachers
were
Henry
Womer
,
Miss
Mary
Ryon
and
Harriet
B.
Wright
.

Miss
Wright
,
who
afterwards
became
the
wife
of
Ira
Bulkley
,
taught
a
term
of
thirteen
weeks
beginning
June
00
,
0000
,
in
an
old
log
dwelling
house
"
located
where
C.
L.
Pattison
now
resides
.
"

She
had
eighteen
pupils
—
eight
boys
and
ten
girls
.

They
were
John
,
Amariah
and
Hannah
(
wife
of
George
L.
Byon
)
Hammond
;
Esther
Wright
(
second
wife
of

In
0000
her
sister
Esther
,
one
of
her
pupils
,
who
became
the
second
wife
of
Ira
Bulkley
,
dictated
for
publication
an
article
which
appeared
in
the
Elkland
Journal
,
in
which
she
said
:
Elkland
at
that
time
,
did
not
show
signs
of
becoming
a
village
.

It
had
no
tavern
,
nor
store
,
nor
shop
of
any
kind
—
not
even
a
distillery
.

There
was
no
church
in
the
Cowanesque
valley
,
and
the
itinerant
Methodist
ministers
who
passed
this
way
once
in
six
weeks
,
held
preaching
services
in
some
barn
in
the
summer
season
.

John
Ryon
,
Sr.
was
postmaster
and
kept
the
office
at
his
dwelling
house
,
at
which
the
mail
arrived
by
carrier
on
horseback
,
once
a
week
(
Tuesdays
)
.

John
Ryon
,
Esq.
,
"
as
my
father
wrote
his
name
among
the
patrons
of
my
sister
’s
school
,
was
at
that
time
a
member
of
the
state
senate
,
deservedly
popular
,
a
most
generous
and
obliging
gentleman
.

In
0000
the
first
school
building
was
erected
.

It
is
still
standing
just
west
of
the
Presbyterian
church
and
is
occupied
as
a
dwelling
by
James
Brocksley
.

It
was
built
by
Rodney
Shaw
,
afterwards
a
well
known
citizen
of
Mansfield
,
PA
.

At
the
raising
there
was
used
one
and
one-half
gallons
of
whiskey
,
bought
of
H.
Freeborn
,
of
Shaver
’s
Point
—
now
Lawrenceville
—
for
fifty
cents
.

This
school
house
was
also
used
as
a
church
until
0000
.

It
was
built
by
subscription
.

One
of
the
early
teachers
here
after
the
adoption
of
the
public
school
system
was
James
Tubbs
,
who
taught
in
the
winter
of
0000-00
.

in
the
article
already
quoted
from
,
he
says
:
"
I
had
no
blackboard
.

My
only
classes
were
in
spelling
and
reading
.

Grammar
was
not
a
branch
of
study
in
my
school
.

In
arithmetic
I
had
no
class
.

Each
student
began
and
ciphered
as
far
as
he
or
she
could
in
the
science
of
numbers
with
my
assistance
.

In
teaching
geography
the
same
method
was
pursued
.

Considerable
attention
was
given
to
penmanship
.
"

The
second
school
house
was
built
in
0000
,
and
was
a
two-story
frame
,
with
rooms
for
two
departments
.

In
0000
Joel
Parkhurst
proposed
to
give
the
district
a
new
brick
school
house
,
costing
$
0,000
,
provided
the
people
would
raise
a
fund
of
$
0,000
,
to
be
placed
at
interest
and
the
interest
used
to
keep
the
house
in
order
and
purchase
apparatus
.

The
offer
was
accepted
and
the
building
erected
.

It
ranks
as
third
among
the
school
houses
of
the
county
.

Prof.
M.
F.
Cass
has
been
principal
of
this
school
since
0000
,
and
has
proven
himself
an
able
,
efficient
and
popular
educator
.

.

Dr.
Rose
migrated
to
Tioga
County
from
Rutland
(
town
)
,
Vermont
.

served
as
a
frontier
doctor
for

Counties
.

built
a
distillery
at
Roseville
in
0000
,
soon
after
his
son
,
William
Rose
Jr.
,
opened
a
tavern
.

The

A
chisel
is
a
tool
with
a
characteristically
shaped
cutting
edge
(
such
that
wood
chisels
have
lent
part
of
their
name
to
a
particular
grind
)
of
blade
on
its
end
,
for
carving
or
cutting
a
hard
material
such
as
wood
,
stone
,
or
metal
.

The
handle
and
blade
of
some
types
of
chisel
are
made
of
metal
or
wood
with
a
sharp
edge
in
it
.

In
use
,
the
chisel
is
forced
into
the
material
to
cut
it
.

The
driving
force
may
be
manually
applied
or
applied
using
a
mallet
or
hammer
.

In
industrial
use
,
a
hydraulic
ram
or
falling
weight
(
'
trip
hammer
'
)
drives
the
chisel
into
the
material
to
be
cut
.

A
gouge
,
one
type
of
chisel
,
is
used
,
particularly
in
woodworking
,
woodturning
and
sculpture
,
to
carve
small
pieces
from
the
material
.

Gouges
are
most
often
used
in
creating
concave
surfaces
.

A
gouge
typically
has
a
'
U
'
-
shaped
cross-section
.

Use
Chisels
have
a
wide
variety
of
uses
.

Many
types
of
chisel
have
been
devised
,
each
specially
suited
to
its
intended
use
.

Different
types
of
chisel
may
be
constructed
quite
differently
,
in
terms
of
blade
width
or
length
,
as
well
as
shape
and
hardness
of
blade
.

They
may
have
a
wooden
or
plastic
handle
attached
or
may
be
made
entirely
of
one
piece
of
metal
.

Woodworking
Woodworking
chisels
range
from
small
hand
tools
for
tiny
details
,
to
large
chisels
used
to
remove
big
sections
of
wood
,
in
'
roughing
out
'
the
shape
of
a
pattern
or
design
.

Typically
,
in
woodcarving
,
one
starts
with
a
larger
tool
,
and
gradually
progresses
to
smaller
tools
to
finish
the
detail
.

One
of
the
largest
types
of
chisel
is
the
slick
,
used
in
timber
frame
construction
and
wooden
shipbuilding
.

There
are
many
types
of
woodworking
chisels
used
for
specific
purposes
,
such
as
:
Lathe
tools
A
lathe
tool
is
a
woodworking
chisel
designed
to
cut
wood
as
it
is
spun
on
a
lathe
.

These
tools
have
longer
handles
for
more
leverage
,
needed
to
counteract
the
tendency
of
the
tool
to
react
to
the
downward
force
of
the
spinning
wood
being
cut
or
carved
.

In
addition
,
the
angle
and
method
of
sharpening
is
different
;
a
secondary
bevel
would
not
be
ground
on
the
tool
.

Metalworking
Chisels
used
in
metal
work
can
be
divided
into
two
main
categories
:
hot
chisels
and
cold
chisels
.

Cold
chisel
A
cold
chisel
is
a
tool
made
of
tempered
steel
used
for
cutting
'
cold
'
metals
,
meaning
that
they
are
not
used
in
conjunction
with
heating
torches
,
forges
,
etc.
.

Cold
chisels
are
used
to
remove
waste
metal
when
a
very
smooth
finish
is
not
required
or
when
the
work
can
not
be
done
easily
with
other
tools
,
such
as
a
hacksaw
,
file
,
bench
shears
or
power
tools
.

The
name
cold
chisel
comes
from
its
use
by
blacksmiths
to
cut
metal
while
it
was
cold
as
compared
to
other
tools
they
used
to
cut
hot
metal
.

Because
cold
chisels
are
used
to
form
metal
,
they
have
a
less-acute
angle
to
the
sharp
portion
of
the
blade
than
a
woodworking
chisel
.

This
gives
the
cutting
edge
greater
strength
at
the
expense
of
sharpness
.

Cold
chisels
come
in
a
variety
of
sizes
,
from
fine
engraving
tools
that
are
tapped
with
very
light
hammers
,
to
massive
tools
that
are
driven
with
sledgehammer
s.
Cold
chisels
are
forged
to
shape
and
hardened
and
tempered
(
to
a
blue
colour
)
at
the
cutting
edge
.

The
head
of
the
chisel
is
chamfered
to
slow
down
the
formation
of
the
mushroom
shape
caused
by
hammering
and
is
left
soft
to
withstand
hammer
blows
.

There
are
four
common
types
of
cold
chisel
.

These
are
the
flat
chisel
,
the
most
widely
known
type
,
which
is
used
to
cut
bars
and
rods
to
reduce
surfaces
and
to
cut
sheet
metal
which
is
too
thick
or
difficult
to
cut
with
tin
snips
.

The
cross
cut
chisel
is
used
for
cutting
grooves
and
slots
.

The
blade
narrows
behind
the
cutting
edge
to
provide
clearance
.

The
round
nose
chisel
is
used
for
cutting
semi-circular
grooves
for
oil
ways
in
bearings
.

The
diamond
point
chisel
is
used
for
cleaning
out
corners
or
difficult
places
and
pulling
over
centre
punch
marks
wrongly
placed
for
drilling
.

Although
the
vast
majority
of
cold
chisels
are
made
of
steel
,
a
few
are
manufactured
from
beryllium
copper
,
for
use
in
special
situations
where
non
-
sparking
tools
are
required
.

Hot
chisel
A
hot
chisel
is
used
to
cut
metal
that
has
been
heated
in
a
forge
to
soften
the
metal
.

One
type
of
hot
chisel
is
the
"
hardy
chisel
"
,
which
is
used
in
an
anvil
hardy
hole
with
the
cutting
edge
oriented
up
.

The
hot
workpiece
cut
is
then
placed
over
the
chisel
and
struck
with
a
hammer
.

The
hammer
drives
the
workpiece
into
the
chisel
,
which
allows
it
to
be
snapped
off
with
a
pair
of
tongs
.

Stone
Stone
chisels
are
used
to
carve
or
cut
stone
,
bricks
or
concrete
slabs
.

To
cut
,
as
opposed
to
carve
,
a
brick
bolster
is
used
;
this
has
a
wide
,
flat
blade
that
is
tapped
along
the
cut
line
to
produce
a
groove
,
then
hit
hard
in
the
centre
to
crack
the
stone
.

Sculptors
use
a
spoon
chisel
,
which
is
bent
,
with
the
bezel
(
cutting
edge
)
on
both
sides
.

To
increase
the
force
,
stone
chisels
are
often
hit
with
club
hammer
s
,
a
heavier
type
of
hammer
.

Masonry
Masonry
chisels
are
typically
heavy
,
with
a
relatively
dull
head
that
wedges
and
breaks
,
rather
than
cuts
.

Normally
used
as
a
demolition
tool
,
they
may
be
mounted
on
a
hammer
drill
,
jack
hammer
,
or
hammered
manually
,
usually
with
a
heavy
hammer
of
three
pounds
or
more
.

A
plugging
chisel
has
a
tapered
edge
for
cleaning
out
hardened
mortar
.

The
chisel
is
held
with
one
hand
and
struck
with
a
hammer
.

The
direction
of
the
taper
in
the
blade
determines
if
the
chisel
cuts
deep
or
runs
shallow
along
the
joint
.

Gouge
A
modern
gouge
is
similar
to
a
chisel
except
its
blade
edge
is
not
flat
,
but
instead
is
curved
or
angled
in
cross-section
.

The
modern
version
is
generally
hafted
inline
,
the
blade
and
handle
typically
having
the
same
long
axis
.

If
the
angle
of
the
plane
of
the
blade
is
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
curve
the
gouge
is
called
an
'
incannel
'
gouge
,
otherwise
it
is
known
as
an
'
outcannel
'
gouge

carve
the
violin
,
a
craftsman
may
use
it
to
scoop
out
wood
for
a
project

Rider-Waite
symbolism
Interpretation
A.
E.
Waite
was
a
key
figure
in
the
development
of
modern
Tarot
interpretations
.

However
,
not
all
interpretations
follow
his
model
.

Some
frequent
keywords
used
by
tarot
readers
for
the
interpretation
of
Death
are
:
According
to
Eden
Gray
and
other
authors
on
the
subject
,
it
is
unlikely
that
this
card
actually
represents
a
physical
death
.

Typically
it
implies
an
end
,
possibly
of
a
relationship
or
interest
,
and
therefore
implies
an
increased
sense
of
self-awareness
—
not
to
be
confused
with
self-consciousness
or
any
kind
of
self-diminishment
.

Lewisburg
is
a
borough
in
Union
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
,
south
by
southeast
of
Williamsport
and
north
of
Harrisburg
.

In
the
past
,
it
was
the
commercial
center
for
a
fertile
grain
and
general
farming
region
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Union
County
.

Located
in
central
Pennsylvania
,
on
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
,
Lewisburg
is
northwest
of
Sunbury
.

It
is
home
to
Bucknell
University
and
is
near
the
Lewisburg
Federal
Penitentiary
.

Its
00th-century
downtown
was
recently
placed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

History
Lewisburg
was
founded
in
0000
by
Ludwig
Derr
.

A
settler
of
the
area
(
since
as
early
as
0000-0000
)
,
Derr
had
purchased
several
tracts
of
land
from
the
William
Penn
family
and
other
neighboring
land
owners
;
the
largest
of
which
was
known
as
"
The
Prescott
"
.

Having
been
on
the
land
for
such
a
long
time
,
Derr
had
befriended
the
local
Native
Americans
of
the
area
.

Even
as
many
of
the
other
inhabitants
routinely
were
sacked
by
Native
Americans
,
Derr
's
lands
remained
free
from
attacks
.

Subsequently
,
in
0000
,
he
worked
with
Samuel
Weiser
(
son
of
Conrad
Weiser
,
the
famous
Native
Americans
liaison
who
died
in
0000
,
and
with
whose
family
Derr
's
own
paternal
family
had
been
friends
)
to
layout
his
combined
land
tracts
,
and
create
Derrstown
.

The
name
was
later
,
after
Derr
's
death
,
changed
to
Lewisburg
.

Much
has
been
considered
regarding
'
how
'
the
name
changed
from
Derrstown
to
Lewisburg
.

The
most
likely
truth
is
that
Derr
's
first
name
"
Ludwig
"
translated
into
English
as
"
Louis
"
but
,
being
of
German
descent
,
it
was
spelled
"
Lewis
"
.

Later
,
after
Derr
's
death
,
the
traditional
germanic
"
burg
"
was
appended
to
his
first
name
to
create
Lewisburg
.

The
street
names
that
run
East
and
West
are
a
local
urban
mystery
.

St.
George
,
St.
Catherine
,
and
St.
Louis
etc.
appear
to
be
named
for
Saints
.

However
,
since
Derr
was
a
Lutheran
,
and
did
not
pay
homage
to
Catholic
saints
,
this
is
unlikely
.

Rather
,
the
street
names
are
more
likely
named
for
Derr
's
family
members
,
as
those
streets
are
consecutively
parallel
,
and
emanate
from
what
was
then
Derr
's
home
,
and
the
location
of
the
first
available
lot
sold
(
which
were
both
situated
on
,
what
is
now
,
Mill
Street
)
.

George
was
Ludwig
's
son
,
his
wife
Catherine
and
Ludwig/Lewis
(
sic
)
himself
.

The
other
original
street
names
that
still
exist
are
St.
John
,
St.
Mary
and
St.
Anthony
,
which
are
probably
the
names
of
other
children
from
families
with
whom
Derr
's
own
family
were
friends
.

However
,
there
is
an
indication
that
Derr
also
had
a
daughter
named
Mary
.

Overall
,
however
,
the
premise
is
further
supported
by
the
notion
that
the
German
word
for
street
is
Strasse
(
Straße
,
abbreviated
St
)
.

At
the
time
,
street
names
were
pronounced
as
Strasse
Mary
or
Strasse
George
.

Later
,
when
signs
were
made
to
note
the
street
names
,
the
abbreviation
for
Strasse
was
allowed
to
remain
,
but
the
US/English
abbreviation
was
redundantly
added
to
the
signs
.

The
second
mystery
surrounding
Lewisburg
is
the
disappearance
of
its
founder
Ludwig
Derr
.

After
selling
several
lots
of
land
,
Derr
set
off
for
Philadelphia
to
sell
additional
lots
.

Shortly
after
arriving
,
records
indicate
some
of
his
lots
had
sold
.

However
,
Ludwig
Derr
simply
disappears
from
history
in
that
city
.

Derr
's
son
George
went
to
Philadelphia
to
search
for
his
father
,
but
returned
a
short
time
later
,
unsuccessful
.

Over
the
centuries
,
Lewisburg
has
been
a
center
of
commerce
in
Union
County
.

The
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
was
used
for
logging
and
shipping
,
and
remains
of
old
factories
and
other
ancient
stone
structures
exist
along
the
river
banks
.

Prior
to
,
and
during
,
the
Civil
War
,
many
abolitionists
lived
in
the
area
,
and
several
locations
within
the
town
of
Lewisburg
served
as
stopping
points
on

’
plots
that
were
sold
to
other
adventurous
settlers
,
many
of
them
German
,
and
the
village
of

villages
combined

were
incorporated
.

The

the
initial
exploration
and
development
of
the
petroleum
industry
.

After
the
first
oil
well
s
were
drilled
nearby
in
the
0000s
,
Oil
City
became
central
in
the
petroleum
industry
while
hosting
headquarters
for
the
Pennzoil
,
Quaker
State
,
and
Wolf
's
Head
motor
oil
companies
.

Tourism
plays
a
prominent
role
in
the
region
by
promoting
oil
heritage
sites
,
nature
trails
,
and
Victorian
architecture
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
,
and
is
part
of
the
Oil

,
PA
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
In
the
early
00th
century
,
the
Seneca
nation
first
settled
in
the
region
;
by
,
the
late
00th
century
Chief
Cornplanter
was
given
three
tracts
of
land
as
a
"
gift
"
from
the
State
of
Pennsylvania
.

In
0000
,
local
prospectors
purchased
the
land
and
built
a
blast
furnace
,
which
closed
in
the
early
0000s
.

As
population
in
the
area
began
to
decline
,
Colonel
Edwin
L.
Drake
drilled
the
first
commercially
successful
oil
well
on
August
00
,
0000
,
in
nearby
Titusville
.

A
number
of
boomtown
s
came
to
life
in
the
region
,
including
Oil
City
,
Titusville
,
Petroleum
Center
,
Pithole
,
and
Rynd
Farm
.

Barges
were
used
to
transport
the
oil
down
Oil
Creek
and
into
Oil
City
,
where
it
was
transported
to
steamboats
or
bulk
barges
to
continue
on
to
Pittsburgh
and
other
locations
.

Oil
City
was
founded
in
0000
,
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
,
and
chartered
as
a
city
in
0000
.

The
Borough
of
Oil
City
was
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
.

The
city
was
partially
destroyed
by
flood
in
0000
and
by
both
flood
and
fire
in
0000
and
again
in
0000
;
on
this
last
occasion
,
several
oil
tanks
that
were
struck
by
lightning
gave
way
,
and
Oil
Creek
carried
a
mass
of
burning
oil
into
the
city
,
where
some
00
lives
were
lost
and
property
valued
at
more
than
$
0
million
was
destroyed
.

Oil
City
grew
into
a
thriving
community
through
the
later
half
of
the
00th
century
and
into
the
00th
century
.

By
the
0000s
,
Pennzoil
,
Quaker
State
,
and
Wolf
's
Head
had
all
relocated
their
headquarters
elsewhere
.

However
,
some
oil
wells
continue
to
produce
a
steady
supply
of
quality
petroleum
.

Regional
governments
and
public
organizations
promote
tourism
by
thoroughly
educating
the
public
about
oil
history
.

Oil
City
's
location
along
the
Allegheny
River
in
the
foothills
of
the
Appalachian
Mountains
provides
excellent
opportunities
for
exploring
Northwestern
