History
As
a
platted
town
the
history
of
West
Middlesex
goes
back
to
0000
,
when
James
Gilkey
surveyed
the
site
.

The
surveyor
was
best
known
to
fame
,
however
,
as
the
man
who
cultivated
and
brought
into
notice
the
"
Neshannock
potatoes
,
"
or
sometimes
called
the
"
Gilkies
:
and
"
Messers
.
"

James
McConnell
was
owner
of
the
tract
upon
which
the
town
was
platted
.

For
many
years
West
Middlesex
has
been
one
of
the
centers
of
the
iron
industry
along
the
Shenango
valley
.

The
two
industrial
concerns
of
note
are
the
Ella
and
Fannie
furnaces
,
owned
and
operated
by
separate
corporations
.

The
Fannie
is
the
older
of
these
furnaces
,
having
first
been
put
in
blast
in
0000
,
and
was
remodeled
in
0000
.

The
Ella
furnace
was
built
in
0000
,
on
the
site
of
two
furnaces
that
had
been
constructed
in
0000
and
had
mutable
fortunes
.

E.A.
Wheeler
of
Sharon
was
for
many
years
manager
of
the
Ella
and
Wheeler
furnaces
.

In
0000
the
United
Iron
and
Steel
Company
,
of
which
Edwin
N.
Ohl
of
Pittsburgh
is
president
,
bought
the
Fannie
furnace
and
have
since
operated
it
.

The
product
is
basic
and
all
kinds
of
pig
iron
,
and
the
average
number
of
employees
is
000
.

The
Ella
furnace
has
been
recently
dismantled
,
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
stack
with
all
modern
improvements
.

West
Middlesex
was
one
of
the
first
places
along
the
Shenango
valley
to
become
a
center
of
the
iron
business
,
and
the
old
Middlesex
furnace
,
erected
in
0000
,
was
a
charcoal
burning
plant
that
smelted
the
native
ores
.

The
modern
furnaces
here
,
however
,
have
all
been
constructed
for
coke
and
Lake
Superior
ore
.

,
West
Middlesex
is
one
of
the
oldest
localities
in
the
county
.

The
honors
of
first
settlement
in
this
vicinity
are
given
Samuel
Byers
,
Andrew
Wylie
,
William
Bell
,
Richard
Vanfleet
and
several
others
who
came
before
the
close
of
the
century
.

In
0000
James
McConnell
located
within
the
present
limits
of
the
borough
.

Jacob
Edeburn
was
owner
of
a
large
tract
of
land
embracing
part
of
the
town
site
,
which
was
granted
for
military
services
in
0000
to
James
Gibson
.

William
Edeburn
,
son
of
Jacob
,
improved
some
of
this
land
lying
west
of
the
river
during
the
first
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
in
0000
built
a
log
grist
mill
which
was
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
vicinity
,
and
which
was
so
useful
to
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
that
it
became
a
natural
center
of
the
settlements
around
about
.

When
James
McConnell
came
in
0000
he
bought
the
mill
and
a
part
of
the
land
,
and
the
log
house
which
he
set
up
near
the
mill
was
the
first
residence
in
the
town
.

William
Edeburn
and
James
McConnell
were
the
industrial
magnates
of
their
day
,
the
former
putting
up
a
sawmill
in
0000
and
the
latter
constructing
a
first-class
flour
mill
a
little
way
below
the
old
log
mill
.

A
store
and
a
tavern
were
opened
about
the
time
the
town
was
platted
,
and
in
0000
the
post
office
was
established
,
with
Robert
Young
as
the
first
postmaster
.

Other
improvements
came
at
varying
intervals
.

A
little
,
frame
house
was
built
in
0000
in
which
school
sessions
were
kept
and
church
services
held
.

In
0000
the
citizens
contributed
enough
money
to
build
a
two-story
frame
schoolhouse
,
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
one
which
had
served
its
purpose
for
nearly
twenty
years
.

This
house
also
was
to
serve
the
cause
of
religion
as
well
as
education
,
the
upper
floor
being
designed
as
a
house
of
worship
.

The
three-story
brick
union
schoolhouse
was
erected
by
the
Middlesex
district
in
0000
,
at
a
cost
of
$
00,000
,
and
at
the
time
it
was
one
of
the
best
educational
structures
in
the
county
.

In
0000
West
Middlesex
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

The
first
burgess
was
D.
Edeburn
,
and
the
first
members
of
the
council
were
C.W.
Watson
,
Hiram
Veach
and
G.R.
Tuttle
.

One
factor
of

A
tactical
shooter
is
a
subgenre
of
first-person
shooter
s
,
where
realistic
(
"
real-world
"
)
settings
are
simulated
by
the
gaming
engine
(
to
the
best
of
its
ability
)
and
players
use
authentic
military
tactics
to
accomplish
goals
in
the
game
,
thus
making
tactics
and
caution
more
important
than
quick
reflexes
in
other
action
game
s.
Tactical
shooters
involving
military
combat
are
sometimes
known
as
"
soldier
sims
"
.

Game
design
According
to
IGN
,
tactical
shooters
"
are
about
caution
,
care
,
cooperation
,
coordination
,
planning
,
and
pacing
.

In
those
games
,
making
decisive
pushes
,
quick
moves
for
cover
,
strategic
retreats
,
and
last
ditch
grabs
at
the
gold
are
not
only
important
to
success
,
but
balanced
in
such
a
way
that
they
become
enjoyable
activities
in
play
.
"

Tactical
shooters
are
designed
for
realism
.

It
is
not
unusual
for
players
to
be
killed
with
a
single
bullet
,
and
thus
players
must
be
more
cautious
than
in
other
shooter
game
s.
The
emphasis
is
on
realistic
modeling
of
weapon
s
,
and
power-up
s
are
often
more
limited
than
in
other
action
game
s.
This
restrains
the
individual
heroism
seen
in
other
shooter
games
,
and
thus
tactics
become
more
important
.

Overall
,
the
style
of
play
is
typically
slower
than
other
action
game
s.
Jumping
techniques
are
sometimes
de-emphasized
in
order
to
promote
realism
,
with
some
games
going
so
far
as
to
omit
a
jump
button
.

In
contrast
to
games
that
emphasize
running
and
shooting
,
tactical
shooters
require
more
caution
and
patience
(
making
use
of
cover
and
avoiding
being
caught
in
the
open
)
.

Many
tactical
shooters
make
use
of
group-based
combat
,
where
the
player
character
is
supported
by
other
teammates
.

While
early
tactical
shooters
had
simple
computer-controlled
teammates
who
offered
support
fire
,
the
artificial
intelligence
in
later
games
has
evolved
with
more
complex
teammate
responses
such
as
cover-fire
mechanics
.

In
games
with
a
sufficiently
robust
artificial
intelligence
,
the
player
character
is
able
to
issue
commands
to
other
computer-controlled
characters
.

Some
games
in
the
genre
allow
players
to
plan
their
team
's
movements
before
a
mission
,
which
the
artificial
intelligence
then
follows
.

Many
games
also
offer
a
multiplayer
online
play
,
allowing
human
players
to
strategize
.

Team-based
tactics
are
emphasized
more
than
other
shooter
games
,
and
thus
accurate
aiming
and
quick
reflexes
are
not
always
sufficient
for
victory
.

The
level
design
usually
reflects
the
game
's
setting
.

For
example
,
the
player
may
play
the
role
of
SWAT
police
fighting
terrorist
s
or
other
criminal
s
,
or
may
engage
in
military
combat
in
real
world
conflicts
as
either
battlefield
soldiers
or
special
forces
commandos
.

Some
games
take
place
in
entirely
fictional
universes
,
and
incorporate
elements
of
science
fiction
.

Each
level
will
have
different
objectives
.

Although
some
levels
may
simply
require
that
the
player
defeat
their
enemy
,
other
levels
may
challenge
the
player
with
objectives
such
as
escorting
a
VIP
safely
to
a
specific
location
or
planting
a
demolition
charge
on
a
target
.

Levels
are
often
designed
with
check
points
or
alternate
routes
.

As
"
run
and
gun
"
assaults
are
often
met
with
heavy
resistance
,
it
becomes
important
to
exploit
a
superior
position
and/or
take
the
enemy
by
surprise
and
even
evading
them
entirely
.

Weapons
Tactical
shooters
often
feature
a
wide
variety
of
weapons
modeled
after
actual
firearms
,
being
more
realistic
than
run-and-gun
shooters
,
however
simulating
actual
combat
is
often
sacrificed
in
favor
of
balance
as
well
as
playability
.

There
are
often
considerable
modifications
to
in-game
weapons
and
ballistics
from
their
real-life
counterparts
in
order
to
ensure
balance
in
multiplayer
.

For
instance
Counter-Strike
and
other
games
allow
the
player
to
survive
multiple
bullet
hits
to
the
torso
(
ignoring
the
bullet
resistance
of
different
types
of
ballistic
vest
s
)
and
even
more
to
the
legs
(
rarely
armored
in
real-life
)
,
while
registering
an
automatic
kill
for
melee
hits
(
whether
punches
or
knife
stabs
)
and
"
headshots
"
(
including
a
pistol
shot
to
the
back
of
the
head
even
if
the
target
is
wearing
a
combat
helmet
)
.

Tactical
shooters
are
usually
designed
so
that
shooting
becomes
inaccurate
while
running
which
increasing
accuracy
for
crouching
or
prone
stances
.

Players
often
have
the
choice
of
shooting
from
the
hip
(
"
hippie
"
)
which
is
less
accurate
but
gives
a
wider
view
of
the
area
,
or
using
the
scope/iron
sights
for
better
zoom-in
accuracy
but
at
the
penalty
of
restricted
view
.

Some
tactical
shooters
even
lack
the
crosshair
seen
in
other
first-person
shooter
s
,
in
order
to
achieve
a
high
degree
of
realism
.

In
contrast
to
run
and
gun
shooters
such
as
Quake
which
allow
players
to
carry
full
arsenals
,
tactical
shooters
place
considerable
restrictions
on
what
players
may
be
equipped
with
,
so
players
have
to
carefully
select
weapons
according
to
the
situation
and/or
role
in
their
team
.

Half-Life
:
Counter-Strike
's
system
of
allowing
a
primary
weapon
(
assault
rifle
,
submachine
gun
,
sniper
rifle
,
or
shotgun
)
and
a
secondary
weapon
(
pistol
)
has
been
followed
by
other
shooters
like
Call
of
Duty
0
:
Modern
Warfare
.

Wielding
or
carrying
heavier
weapons
such
as
sniper
rifles
and
machine
guns
often
incurs
a
movement
penalty
over
light
weapons
like
submachine
guns
and
pistols
.

Players
often
find
loopholes
in
this
system
,
such
as
in
Half-Life
:
Counter-Strike
where
they
would
switch
their
firearm
to
a
knife
in
order
to
run
faster
.

Due
to
the
problem
of
grenade
spamming
,
the
effect
of
explosions
are
often
toned
down
and/or
only
0-0
grenades
are
allowed
to
be
carried
.

Akimbo
(
Dual
wielding
)
of
weapons
,
despite
being
ineffective
and
inaccurate
in
real
life
,
is
frequently
featured
in
tactical
shooters
likely
as
a
homage
to
films
.

The
Desert
Eagle
,
despite
its
heavy
weight
,
recoil
,
and
limited
magazine
capability
make
it
unsuitable
for
actual
military
and
special
forces
applications
,
is
frequently
found
in
many
tactical
shooters
as
a
high-powered
handgun
option
.

Examples
of
these
elements
are
in
Counter-Strike
and
the
Call
of
Duty
:
Modern
Warfare
series
.

History
The
tactical
shooter
genre
was
pioneered
in
0000
with
the
game
industry
generally
crediting
games
such
as
Rainbow
Six
and
Ghost
Recon
with
defining
and
refining
the
tactical
shooter
genre
.

Another
key
title
was
Delta
Force
,
which
emphasized
real-world
weaponry
and
quick
kills
.

The
genre
was
also
influenced
by
the
SWAT
series
,
a
spin-off
from
the
Police
Quest
series
of
adventure
game
s.
Rainbow
Six
has
been
credited
as
a
revolutionary
game
,
which
defined
the
conventions
of
the
genre
.

The
game
was
inspired
by
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
Hostage
Rescue
Team
,
and
was
designed
to
replicate
a
team
of
specialists
performing
a
skilled
operation
.

The
game
was
designed
to
emphasize
strategy
in
a
way
that
would
be
fun
for
players
without
the
best
reflexes
.

The
series
has
since
become
a
benchmark
for
the
genre
in
terms
of
detail
and
accuracy
.

Tactical
shooters
such
as
Soldier
of
Fortune
feature
graphic
depiction
of
gore
and
violence
,
which
both
proponents
and
detractors
consider
to
be
more
realistic
than
most
first-person
shooter
games
.

Among
one
of
the
first
first-person
shooters
to
feature
real
world
rather
than
futuristic
weapons
,
it
included
single-player
and
multiplayer
gameplay
with
the
concept
of
playing
as
a
mercenary
.

Some
of
the
most
notable
tactical
shooters
have
been
total

mods
of

titles
which

released
for

Infiltration
,
a

of
Unreal

,
has
been
described
as
"
turning
Unreal
Tournament
's
wild
cartoon
action
into
a
harrowing
game
of
cat
and
mouse
"
.

Infiltration
has
been
noted
for
detailed
aiming
system
including
hip
(
"

)
and
scope/iron
fire
while
lacking

)
,
and
a
customizable
loadout
system
that
allows
configuration
of
weapons
(
including

)
with
a

.

Half-Life
:
Counter-Strike
(
0000
)
,
a
mod
of
Half-Life
(
0000
)
,
was
the
most
popular
multiplayer
game
of
its
era
despite
the
release
of
first-person
shooters
with
more
advanced
graphics
engines
such
as
Unreal
Tournament
0000
.

Since
the
0000s
,
contemporary
tactical
shooters
such
as
Call
of
Duty
:
Modern
Warfare
and
Battlefield
have
proven
more
popular
than
futuristic
first-person
shooters
such
as
Quake

Unreal
(
the
latter
two
pioneering
FPS
series
whose
most
recent
titles
were
released
in

and

)
.

However
the
field
of
true
tactical
shooters
has
been
largely
neglected
by
developers
,
as
traditionally
realistic
tactical
shooter
series
like
Rainbow

and
Ghost
Recon
have
seen
their
sequels
drift
away
from
careful-paced
tactical
realism
towards
cinematic
centered
themes
and
run-and-gun
play
,
as
can
be
witnessed
by
e.g.
contemporary
Rainbow
Six
titles
,
which
completely
do
away
with

History
Kistler
,
Pennsylvania
is
one
of
the
United
States
'
lesser
known
Company
Towns
.

A
Company
Town
is
a
settlement
built
and
operated
by
a
single
business
enterprise
.

Most
company
towns
were
established
between
0000
and
0000
during
the
early
industrial
age
.

See
list
of
company
towns
.

Kistler
was
initially
established
to
meet
the
needs
of
a
large
manufacturing
plant
by
providing
comfortable
homes
for
its
workmen
within
close
proximity
of
the
factory
.

The
town
was
built
and
owned
by
the
Mount
Union
Refractories
Company
(
MURC
)
,
a
large
brick
making
plant
originally
located
at
the
foot
of
Mount
Union
,
Pennsylvania
.

The
MURC
sought
to
design
and
implement
an
industrial
village
which
provided
the
best
home
and
surrounding
environment
for
its
employees
,
in
the
hope
that
this
would
achieve
the
highest
possible
working
efficiency
.

In
order
to
successfully
accomplish
this
goal
,
the
company
appointed
distinguished
town
planner
John
Nolen
to
design
a
model
company
town
.

John
Nolen
was
a
prominent
planner
of
his
time
,
producing
nearly
four
hundred
planning
projects
,
with
more
than
00
of
those
company
towns
.

Nolen
published
New
Towns
for
Old
in
0000
,
which
carefully
outlines
in
detail
the
planning
precautions
taken
in
the
towns
’
design
and
also
includes
illustrations
of
Kistler
’s
planned
layout
.

Development
0000
saw
the
construction
of
the
industrial
village
.

At
this
stage
,
MURC
employed
some
seven
hundred
employees
.

The
town
of
Kistler
was
located
on
the
East
side
of
the
Juniata
River
,
one
and
half
miles
east
from
the
Refractories
site
.

MURC
acquired
a
sufficient
land
size
of
about
sixty
acres
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
the
works
,
in
order
to
reduce
the
potential
spread
of
dust
,
dirt
and
noise
.

The
site
of
the
planned
town
was
of
triangular
in
shape
,
bordered
by
the
Juniata
River
,
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
Topography
and
pre
existing
agricultural
land
.

Town
Layout
Although
there
was
no
definite
axis
in
John
Nolen
’s
design
,
the
centre
point
of
the
plan
was
said
to
be
the
major
recreational
facility
,
‘
Kistler
Green
’
.

These
well
planned
open
spaces
provided
recreational
areas
for
all
residents
.

Park
Road
and
Nolen
Street
were
the
two
arterials
leading
into
the
development
from
the
south
,
while
running
parallel
to
the
railway
is
State
Street
.

Nolen
’s
original
plan
included
provisions
for
a
proposed
train
station
.

Street
Design
There
were
two
major
street
widths
in
the
design
of
Kistler
.

The
forty
foot
design
allowed
for
eighteen
foot
of
road
and
twenty-two
feet
of
sidewalk
and
planting
space
.

In
contrast
the
seventy
foot
street
allowed
for
two
lanes
with
a
central
twenty-two
foot
parking
strip
.

The
street
widths
played
a
pivotal
role
in
allocating
as
much
area
to
the
lot
owner
as
possible
whilst
avoiding
street
paving
costs
.

In
the
early
stages
of
the
development
while
the
streets
would
not
have
been
prone
to
large
volumes
of
traffic
throughput
they
served
a
secondary
purpose
;
play
spaces
for
children
.

Park
Features
The
large
amount
of
open
areas
in
Nolen
’s
design
retained
the
natural
woods
which
included
willow
,
locust
,
sycamore
,
persimmon
and
black
and
white
oak
.

The
river
embankment
was
to
be
reserved
for
parkland
with
the
northern
end
comprising
a
playground
and
picnic
facilities
and
the
south
a
boat
landing
,
athletic
field
,
baseball
diamond
and
a
field
house
.

Housing
design
The
houses
constructed
for
employees
were
built
with
varying
character
in
detached
or
semi
detached
quadrangles
.

This
was
thought
to
bring
some
individuality
among
the
residents
and
their
houses
and
to
generally
provide
the
best
surroundings
for
the
employees
and
their
families
.

Dwellings
were
built
on
block
sizes
of
forty
feet
in
width
by
one
hundred
feet
in
depth
.

Almost
two
hundred
dwellings
were
built
in
total
,
with
houses
ranging
from
four
to
eight
rooms
in
total
and
all
houses
including
their
own
baths
and
porches
.

Community
wellbeing
It
was
evident
that
Nolen
and
MURC
gave
considerable
attention
to
the
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
Kistler
.

The
design
aspired
to
provide
not
only
comfortable
housing
and
surrounds
but
equally
importantly
it
attempted
to
promote
a
sense
of
belonging
and
citizenship
among
the
residents
.

John
Nolen
discusses
the
success
of
Kistler
and
its
design
in
his
book
New
Towns
for
Old
(
0000
)
when
he
states
that
‘
there
are
few
places
in
this
country
where
the
problem
of
low
cost
housing
,
primarily
for
the
unskilled
worker
has
been
better
solved
for
the
employer
and
employee
alike

Lewistown
is
a
borough
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Mifflin
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

It
is
the
principal
city
of
the
Lewistown
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
which
encompasses
all
of
Mifflin
County
.

It
lies
along
the
Juniata
River
,
northwest
of
Harrisburg
.

The

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
principal
borough
of
the
Lewistown
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Of
the
four
communities
in
the
United
States
named
"
Lewistown
"
,
this
borough
is
the
largest
.

History
Early
history
The
borough
was
incorporated
in
0000
and
was
named
for
William
"
Bill
"
Lewis
,
a
Quaker
and
a
member
of
the
legislature
,
who
was
responsible
for
the
designation
of
the
borough
,
which
was
then
known
as
the
Village
of
Ohesson
,
as
the
county
seat
of
Mifflin
County
.

During
the
late
00th
century
Mifflin
County
became
the
crossroads
of
the
Commonwealth
.

Located
near
the
geographic
center
of
the
state
,
the
area
became
a
hub
for
traffic
moving
in
every
direction
.

Early
roads
crisscrossed
the
region
,
but
it
was
the
eventual
construction
of
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
and
the
railroads
that
followed
that
truly
positioned
Mifflin
County
as
an
economic
force
in
the
state
.

Lewistown
,
as
the
major
city
in
Mifflin
County
,
saw
its
economy
expand
dramatically
as
entrepreneurs
launched
companies
to
construct
canal
boats
or
build
inns
offering
lodging
for
travelers
and
workers
.

At
its
zenith
,
Mifflin
County
was
one
of
the
busiest
centers
for
cargo
and
passenger
traffic
in
the
United
States
.

But
with
the
demise
of
the
canal
system
,
Mifflin
County
eventually
lost
its
place
as
a
major
transportation
hub
.

American
Civil
War
On
April
00
,
0000
,
Lewistown
sent
its
Logan
Guards
,
a
militia
group
originally
formed
in
0000
,
to
Washington
,
D.C.
for
its
defense
.

They
were
one
of
only
five
companies
,
all
recruited
in
Pennsylvania
,
to
share
the
honor
of
being
the
first
U.S.
troops
sent
to
the
capital
.

Monument
Square
,
situated
at
the
intersection
of
Main
and
Market
Streets
in
Lewistown
,
serves
as
a
memorial
to
these
men
.

Tropical
Storm
Agnes
Lewistown
lost
its
role
as
a
major
transportation
hub
,
but
still
boasted
a
strong
industrial
economy
until
the
early
0000s
when
the
county
's
industries
began
a
slow
decline
.

A
ruinous
natural
event
in
June
0000
would
cripple
the
local
economy
and
Lewistown
has
never
recovered
.

On
June
00
,
Agnes
made
initial
landfall
along
the
Florida
Panhandle
as
a
weak
Category
0
Hurricane
.

Agnes
then
proceeded
through
Georgia
,
South
Carolina
and
North
Carolina
before
she
moved
back
over
the
Atlantic
off
the
North
Carolina
coast
on
June
00
.

After
regaining
strength
over
the
Atlantic
,
she
made
landfall
again
over
southeastern
New
York
on
June
00
and
moved
westward
in
an
arc
over
southern
New
York
into
north-central
Pennsylvania
.

She
became
nearly
stationary
over
Pennsylvania
by
morning
of
June
00
,
but
was
soon
absorbed
by
a
low-pressure
system
that
slowly
drifted
northeastward
from
Pennsylvania
into
New
York
.

Rainfall
from
storm
over
the
Mid-Atlantic
region
ranged
from
0-0
inches
in
the
extreme
upper
basins
of
the
Potomac
and
North
Branch
Susquehanna
River
s
to
near
Shamokin
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
Main
Stem
Susquehanna
River
basin
.

An
average
of
0-00
inches
of
rain
fell
over
the
Mid-Atlantic
region
.

The
soil
,
already
well
watered
by
spring
rains
,
could
not
absorb
so
much
water
so
quickly
.

While
flooding
from
the
Juniata
River
was
somewhat
controlled
due
to
a
dam
at
Raystown
Lake
,
west
of
Lewistown
,
the
county
experienced
extensive
flooding
from
the
river
and
major
streams
which
resulted
in
the
permanent
closure
of
many
businesses
along
the
river
.

Most
notably
,
the
flood
submerged
much
of
the
American
Viscose
Plant
,
then
a
division
of
FMC
Corporation
.

The
facility
,
located
on
the
banks
of
the
Juniata
River
across
from
Lewistown
proper
,
manufactured
rayon
fiber
(
primarily
for
rayon-belted
automobile
tires
)
,
polyester
and
Avistrap
.

FMC
was
one
of
two
major
employers
in
the
area
at
the
time
,
the
other
being
the
Standard
Steel
Works
.

The
"
Viscose
"
plant
was
only
marginally
profitable
before
the
storm
and
the
cost
to
reopen
was
prohibitive
.

(
Ironically
,
the
demand
for
rayon
fabric
for
trendy
clothing
shot
upward
only
a
few
years
later
.
)

Rayon
production
,
and
with
it
,
thousands
of
good-paying
jobs
,
moved
to
another
FMC
plant
in
Front
Royal
,
Virginia
.

The
Lewistown
polyester
plant
reopened
,
but
it
rehired
only
a
fraction
of
the
previous
workforce
.

The
site
eventually
became
the
Mifflin
County
Industrial
Plaza
and
a
variety
of
businesses
have
come
and
gone
since
then
.

Present
day
While
Lewistown
did
receive
the
prestigious
All-American
City
award
in
0000
for
its
rebuilding
process
following
the
disaster
,
many
of
the
blue
collar
workforce
left
the
area
to
head
south
,
along
with
the
companies
which
chose
not
to
rebuild
in
Lewistown
.

Lewistown
is
home
to
the
Pennsylvania
State
Fire
School
,
which
is
the
only
such
facility
in
the
state
.

Firefighting
in
Lewistown
is
very
important
,
as
volunteer
firefighters
have
strong
allegiance
to
the
multiple
independent
fire
companies
in
the
borough
to
which
they
devote
their
time
.

Today
,
Lewistown
is
still
looking
to
rebuild
,
but
is
now
overshadowed
by
nearby
State
College
.

Due
to
the
growth
of
Penn
State
and
the
construction
of
a
new
highway
system
,
Lewistown
is
now
struggling
to
avoid
becoming
the
last
rest
stop
for
travelers
coming
from
the
east
on
their
way
to
State
College
.

The
Embassy
Theatre
,
McCoy
House
,
Mifflin
County
Courthouse
,
Montgomery
Ward
Building
,
and

are
listed
on

Lewistown
has
a
passion
for
sports
.

Though
geographically
closer
to
the
Maryland
city
of
Baltimore
,
the
residents
are
almost
equally
divided
in
supporting
the
Pennsylvania
professional
sports
teams
from
Philadelphia
and
Pittsburgh
.

At
the
college
level
,
with
State
College
being
located
about
northwest
of
Lewistown
,
a
good
percentage
of
the
town
support
the
Penn
State
Nittany
Lions
.

People
of
Lewistown
also
support
youth
sports
.

The
area
hosts
a
youth
soccer
tournament
called
Clash
of
the
Cleats
.

The
tournament
attracts
youth
soccer
clubs
throughout
Pennsylvania
,
and
now
is
starting
to
attract
teams
from
neighboring

.

The
Little

,
Babe

teams
grace
the
front
pages
of
the
local

throughout

And
in

,
the
youth

spark
rivalries
between

High
school
sports
Mifflin
County
Huskies
As
of
June
0000
,
the
Mifflin
County
School
District
voted
to
merge
its
two
high
schools
,
Lewistown
Area
High
School
and
neighboring
Indian
Valley
High
School
(
itself
a
merger
of
Chief
Logan
and
Kishacoquillas
high
schools
)
to
form
Mifflin
County
High
School
due
to
increasing
costs
,
declining
enrollment
,
and
lack
of
revenues
from
the
state
level
.

This
is
the
second
time
the
school
district
chose
to
create
a
single
high
school
for
the
county
.

The
first
attempt
at
a
combined
high
school
only
lasted
for
three
years
in
the
0000s
before
district
officials
broke
up
the
school
due
to
public
pressure
.

Mifflin
County
will
compete
at
the
PIAA
District

Class

but
compete

The
newly

,
corresponding
roughly
to
voting
districts

Their
primary
importance
aside
from
community
identity
is
the
postal
system
(
e.g.
,
to
send
a
letter
to
someone
living
in
the
Glenside
community
,
you
would
address
the
letter
to
Glenside
,
Pennsylvania
rather
than
Abington
Township
,
Pennsylvania

some
portions
of
some
of
these
subdivisions
,
including

History
The
villages
that
have
comprised
Lower
Providence
Township
since
the
early
eighteenth
century
include
Evansburg
,
Shannonville
(
now
called
Audubon
)
,
Eagleville
,
and
Providence
Square
.

Lower
Providence
Township
is
currently
bounded
on
the
west
by
Upper
Providence
,
on
the
northeast
by
Perkiomen
and
Worcester
townships
,
on
the
southwest
by
Norriton
,
and
on
the
south
by
the
Schuylkill
River
.

The
area
of
the
township
is
.

Red
shale
predominates
in
the
soils
of
this
part
of
Montgomery
County
.

Many
years
ago
,
lead
mines
were
worked
near
Perkiomen
Creek
at
Oaks
,
Pennsylvania
,
but
did
not
generate
profits
.

The
mines
were
opened
in
0000
and
were
being
operated
in
0000
by
a
Mr.
Wetherell
.

The
discovery
of
copper
followed
that
of
lead
,
and
in
January
,
0000
,
the
Perkiomen
Mining
Association
was
formed
.

Its
land
cost
about
$
00,000
;
much
costly
machinery
was
placed
in
position
and
a
shaft
was
dug
.

Many
thousands
of
tons
of
copper
were
unearthed
over
the
years
until
deposits
were
exhausted
.

Shannonville
was
named
for
a
large
,
influential
family
in
0000
,
when
a
post
office
was
established
there
.

Jack
's
tavern
—
the
present-day
Audubon
Inn
—
was
opened
here
as
well
.

Mr.
Shannon
was
a
prosperous
pig
farmer
and
hence
the
town
gained
the
nickname
"
Hogtown
"
.

Present-day
Audubon
was
christened
in
0000
in
honor
of
early-00th
century
resident
John
James
Audubon
,
who
resided
at
Mill
Grove
,
located
at
the
intersection
of
Audubon
and
Pawlings
roads
.

Local

Audubon
lies
on
the
north
side
of
the

National
Historical

,
and
is

from
the

Prussia
Mall
,
one
of
the
largest

in
the
United

.

Local

include
:
Mill
Grove
[

]
:
Built
in
0000
and
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
,
Mill
Grove
was
the
first
American
home
of
the
renowned
artist
,
author
and
naturalist
John
James
Audubon
.

Between
0000
and
0000
Mill
Grove
and
its
surrounding
fields
and
woodlands
first
inspired
young
Audubon
's
passion
for
painting
and
drawing
birds
.

Today
,
the
estate
remains
largely
as
Audubon
found
it
.

It
serves
as
an
educational
center
of
the
National
Audubon
Society
,
dedicated
to
connecting
people
with
nature
.

A
haven
for
birds
and
wildlife
,
the
property
boasts
more
than
of
trails
and
stunning
views
of
Perkiomen
Creek
.

The
historic
three-story
stone
farmhouse
contains
a
museum
displaying
original
Audubon
prints
,
oil
painting
,
and
Audubon
memorabilia
.

Several
years
later
,
discouraged
by
disputes
with
partners
and
the
failure
of
the
lead
mine
on
the
property
,
Audubon
sold
Mill
Grove
and
moved
to
Kentucky
to
seek
his
fortune
as
a
frontier
merchant
.

Mill
Grove
then
became
the
property
of
Samuel
Wetherill
of
Philadelphia
who
purchased
the
property
in
0000
.

It
remained
in
the
family
until
Herbert
J.
Wetherill
sold
it
in
0000
to
Montgomery
County
.

In
April
0000
the
National
Audubon
Society
and
Montgomery
County
signed
an
agreement
creating
the
Mill
Grove
Audubon
Center
.

The
center
is
managed
by
Audubon
Pennsylvania
,
the
state
office
of
the
National
Audubon

Walnut
Hill
(
Pawlings
Farm
)
:
The
land
known
as
the
Perkiomen
Peninsula
,
and
particularly
the
Pawling
Farm
,
played
an
essential
role
in
the
Valley
Forge
winter
encampment
of
0000
–
0000
.

It
provided
strategic
protection
for
the
camp
;
it
was
the
site
of
the
newly
organized
Commissary
function
that
saved
the
Continental
Army
from
starvation
;
and
it
was
the
ultimate
site
of
the
encampment
itself
before
the
army
marched
on
to
victory
at
Monmouth
.

Today
the
peninsula
is
a
mix
of
habitats
—
open
meadow
,
riparian
and
upland
forest
,
wetlands
and
extensive
vernal
ponds
.

This
is
why
the
Pawling
Farm
lands
provide
the
best
wildlife
habitat
in
the
entire
park
.

In
navigation
,
dead
reckoning
(
also
ded
(
for
deduced
)
reckoning
or
DR
)
is
the
process
of
calculating
one
's
current
position
by
using
a
previously
determined
position
,
or
fix
,
and
advancing
that
position
based
upon
known
or
estimated
speeds
over
elapsed
time
,
and
course
.

Dead
reckoning
is
subject
to
cumulative
errors
.

Advances
in
navigational
aid
s
which
give
accurate
information
on
position
,
in
particular
satellite
navigation
using
the
Global
Positioning
System
,
have
made
simple
dead
reckoning
by
humans
obsolete
for
most
purposes
.

However
,
inertial
navigation
system
s
,
which
provide
very
accurate
directional
information
,
use
dead
reckoning
and
are
very
widely
applied
.

By
analogy
with
their
navigational
use
,
the
words
dead
reckoning
are
also
used
to
mean
the
process
of
estimating
the
value
of
any
variable
quantity
by
using
an
earlier
value
and
adding
whatever
changes
have
occurred
in
the
meantime
.

Often
,
this
usage
implies
that
the
changes
are
not
known
accurately
.

The
earlier
value
and
the
changes
may
be
measured
or
calculated
quantities
.

There
is
speculation
on
the
etymological
origin
of
the
term
,
but
no
reliable
information
.

Errors
Dead
reckoning
may
give
the
best
available
information
on
position
,
but
is
subject
to
significant
errors
due
to
many
factors
as
both
speed
and
direction
must
be
accurately
known
at
all
instants
for
position
to
be
determined
accurately
.

For
example
,
if
displacement
is
measured
by
the
number
of
rotations
of
a
wheel
,
any
discrepancy
between
the
actual
and
assumed
diameter
,
due
perhaps
to
the
degree
of
inflation
and
wear
,
will
be
a
source
of
error
.

As
each
estimate
of
position
is
relative
to
the
previous
one
,
errors
are
cumulative
.

Animal
navigation
In
studies
of
animal
navigation
,
dead
reckoning
is
more
commonly
(
though
not
exclusively
)
known
as
path
integration
.

Animals
use
it
to
estimate
their
current
location
based
on
their
movements
from
their
last
known
location
.

Animals
such
as
ants
,
rodents
,
and
geese
have
been
shown
to
track
their
locations
continuously
relative
to
a
starting
point
and
to
return
to
it
,
an
important
skill
for
foragers
with
a
fixed
home
.

Marine
navigation
In
marine
navigation
a
"
dead
"
reckoning
plot
generally
does
not
take
into
account
the
effect
of
current
s
or
wind
.

Aboard
ship
a
dead
reckoning
plot
is
considered
important
in
evaluating
position
information
and
planning
the
movement
of
the
vessel
.

Dead
reckoning
begins
with
a
known
position
,
or
fix
,
which
is
then
advanced
,
mathematically
or
directly
on
the
chart
,
by
means
of
recorded
heading
,
speed
,
and
time
.

Speed
can
be
determined
by
many
methods
.

Before
modern
instrumentation
,
it
was
determined
aboard
ship
using
a
chip
log
.

More
modern
methods
include
pit
log
referencing
engine
speed
(
e.g.
in
rpm
)
against
a
table
of
total
displacement
(
for
ships
)
or
referencing
one
's
indicated
airspeed
fed
by
the
pressure
from
a
pitot
tube
.

This
measurement
is
converted
to
an
equivalent
airspeed
based
upon
known
atmospheric
conditions
and
measured
errors
in
the
indicated
airspeed
system
.

A
naval
vessel
uses
a
device
called
a
pit
sword
(
rodmeter
)
,
which
uses
two
sensors
on
a
metal
rod
to
measure
the
electromagnetic
variance
caused
by
the
ship
moving
through
water
.

This
change
is
then
converted
to
ship
's
speed
.

Distance
is
determined
by
multiplying
the
speed
and
the
time
.

This
initial
position
can
then
be
adjusted
resulting
in
an
estimated
position
by
taking
into
account
the
current
(
known
as
set
and
drift
in
marine
navigation
)
.

If
there
is
no
positional
information
available
,
a
new
dead
reckoning
plot
may
start
from
an
estimated
position
.

In
this
case
subsequent
dead
reckoning
positions
will
have
taken
into
account
estimated
set
and
drift
.

Dead
reckoning
positions
are
calculated
at
predetermined
intervals
,
and
are
maintained
between
fixes
.

The
duration
of
the
interval
varies
.

Factors
including
one
's
speed
made
good
and
the
nature
of
heading
and
other
course
changes
,
and
the
navigator
's
judgment
determine
when
dead
reckoning
positions
are
calculated
.

Before
the
00th-century
development
of
the
marine
chronometer
and
the
lunar
distance
method
,
dead
reckoning
was
the
primary
method
of
determining
longitude
available
to
mariners
such
as
Christopher
Columbus
and
John
Cabot
on
their
trans-Atlantic
voyages
.

Tools
such
as
the
Traverse
board
were
developed
to
enable
even
illiterate
crew
members
to
collect
the
data
needed
for
dead
reckoning
.

Polynesian
navigation
,
however
,
uses
different
wayfinding
techniques
.

Air
navigation
Before
the
advent
of
modern
aids
dead
reckoning
was
widely
used
in
air
navigation
,
taking
into
account
displacement
of
position
caused
by
wind
as
far
as
possible
,
often
using
a
tool
called
a
wind
triangle
.

As
a
rule
dead
reckoning
(
DR
)
positions
were
calculated
at
least
once
every
000
miles
and
when
making
combined
turns
totaling
more
than
00
degrees
from
the
initial
heading
out
of
the
last
DR
position
.

Simple
dead
reckoning
fell
out
of
use
for
air
navigation
,
but
is
used
by
inertial
navigation
system
s
(
INSes
)
,
which
are
nearly
universal
on
more
advanced
aircraft
.

The
INS
is
used
in
combination
with
other
navigation
aids
,
such
as
GPS
,
in
order
to
provide
reliable
navigation
capability
under
virtually
any
conditions
,
without
the
need
for
external
navigation
references
.

However
,
simple
dead
reckoning
is
still
widely
used
by
civil
aircraft
not
equipped
with
GPS
or
radio
navigation
aids
.

The
pilot
periodically
establishes
a
location
fix
from
visual
sighting
of
landmarks
with
reference
to
a
map
,
allowing
errors
in
dead
reckoned
course
to
be
corrected
.

Pilots
of
advanced
aircraft
are
trained
in
dead
reckoning
,
which
remains
usable
in
case
of
failure
of
advanced
navigational
systems
.

Ded
(
as
in
deduced
)
reckoning
is
still
on
the
curriculum
for
VFR
(
visual
flight
rules
-
or
basic
level
)
pilots
in
Australia
.

It
was
experienced
during
a
navigation
exercise
with
Peter
Binis
Advanced
Flight
Training
with
master
instructor
Steve
Pearce
in
January
0000
.

He
encouraged
its
use
,
for
diversions
.

The
argument
is
that
once
you
have
a
fix
(
on
your
position
)
a
knowledge
of
time/distance
and
an
approximate
heading
will
serve
well
.

A
moderately
experienced
pilot
can
estimate
the
heading
and
distance
without
rulers
and
protractors
.

Look
at
the
chart
,
estimate
the
angle
of
change
,
and
roughly
estimate
the
distance
with
a
thumb
or
finger
-
e.g.
.

A
thumb-width
might
be
five
nautical
miles
.

Divide
the
distance
by
two
for
an
aircraft
flying
000kts
,
and
you
have
the
number
of
minutes
to
fly
that
heading
.

Though
not
perfect
,
it
can
be
remarkably
reliable
.

There
is
also
an
argument
that
the
entire
method
of
navigating
by
charts
,
adjusted
for
wind
and
expected
speed
,
is
in
fact
ded
reckoning
.

This
'
analogue
'
method
,
without
the
aid
of
GPS
and/or
instrument
flight
rules
paths
,
is
at
best
an
estimate
in
need
of
constant
adjustment
.

Again
,
this
is
very
much
current
teaching
practice
for
VFR
pilots
in
Australia
and
elsewhere
.

It
is
taught
regardless
of
whether
the
aircraft
has
navigation
aids
such
as
GPS
,
ADF
and
VOR
.

Automotive
navigation
Dead
reckoning
is
today
implemented
in
some
high-end
automotive
navigation
system
s
in
order
to
overcome
the
limitations
of
GPS
/
GNSS
technology
alone
.

Satellite
microwave
signals
are
unavailable
in
parking
garage
s
and
tunnel
s
,
and
often
severely
degraded
in
urban
canyon
s
and
near
trees
due
to
blocked
lines
of
sight
to
the
satellites
or
multipath
propagation
.

In
a
dead-reckoning
navigation
system
,
the
car
is
equipped
with
sensors
that
know
the
wheel
diameter
and
record
wheel
rotations
and
steering
direction
.

These
sensors
are
often
already
present
in
cars
for
other
purposes
(
anti-lock
braking
system
,
electronic
stability
control
)
and
can
be
read
by
the
navigation
system
from
the
controller-area
network
bus
.

The
navigation
system
then
uses
a
Kalman
filter
to
integrate
the
always-available
sensor
data
with
the
accurate
but
occasionally
unavailable
position
information
from
the
satellite
data
into
a
combined
position
fix
.

Autonomous
navigation
in
robotics
Dead
reckoning
is
utilized
in
some
lower-end
,
non
mission-critical
,
or
tightly
constrained
by
time
or
weight
,
robotic
applications
.

It
is
usually
used
to
reduce
the
need
for
sensing
technology
,
such
as
ultrasonic
sensor
s
,
GPS
,
or
placement
of
some
linear
and
rotary
encoder
s
,
in
an
autonomous
robot
,
thus
greatly
reducing
cost
and
complexity
at
the
expense
of
performance
and
repeatability
.

The
proper
utilization
of
dead
reckoning
in
this
sense
would
be
to
supply
a
known
percentage
of
electrical
power
or
hydraulic
pressure
to
the
robot
's
drive
motors
over
a
given
amount
of
time
from
a
general
starting
point
.

Dead
reckoning
is
not
totally
accurate
,
which
can
lead
to
errors
in
distance
estimates
ranging
from
a
few
millimeters
(
in
CNC
machining
)
to
kilometers
(
in
UAV
's
)
,
based
upon
the
duration
of
the
run
,
the
speed
of
the
robot
,
the
length
of
the
run
,
and
several
other
factors
.

Directional
dead
reckoning
The
south-pointing
chariot
was
an
ancient
Chinese
device
consisting
of
a
two-wheeled
horse-drawn
vehicle
which
carried
a
pointer
that
was
intended
always
to
aim
to
the
south
,
no
matter
how
the
chariot
turned
.

The
chariot
predated
the
navigational
use
of
the
magnetic
compass
,
and
could
not
detect
the
direction
that
was
south
.

Instead
it
used
a
kind
of
directional
dead
reckoning
:
at
the
start
of
a
journey
,
the
pointer
was
aimed
southward
by
hand
,
using
local
knowledge
or
astronomical
observations
e.g.
of
the
Pole
Star
.

Then
,
as
it
travelled
,
a
mechanism
possibly
containing
differential
gears
used
the
different
rotational
speeds
of
the
two
wheels
to
turn
the
pointer
relative
to
the
body
of
the
chariot
by
the
angle
of
turns
made
(
subject
to
available
mechanical
accuracy
)
,
keeping
the
pointer
aiming
in
its
original
direction
,
to
the
south
.

Errors
,
as
always
with
dead
reckoning
,
would
accumulate
as
distance
travelled
increased
.

Differential
steer
drive
dead
reckoning
Here
are
the
dead
reckoning
equations
for
the
coordinates
(
x
and
y
)
,
and
heading
(
\
theta
)
for
a
differential
drive
robot
with
encoders
on
both
drives
:
where
T_0
are
the
encoder
ticks
recorded
on
drive
one
,
T_0
are
the
encoder
ticks
recorded
on
drive
two
,
R_W
is
the
radius
of
each
drive
wheel
,
D
is
the
separation
between
the
wheels
,
and
T_R
is
the
number
of
encoder
ticks
recorded
in
a
full
rotation
of
a
wheel
.

Dead
reckoning
for
networked
games
Networked
games
and
simulation
tools
routinely
use
dead
reckoning
to
predict
where
an
actor
should
be
right
now
,
using
its
last
known
kinematic
state
(
position
,
velocity
,
acceleration
,
orientation
,
and
angular
velocity
)
.

This
is
primarily
needed
because
it
is
impractical
to
send
network
updates
at
the
rate
that
most
games
run
,
00
Hz
.

The
basic
solution
starts
by
projecting
into
the
future
using
linear
physics
:
This
formula
is
used
to
move
the
object
until
a
new
update
is
received
over
the
network
.

At
that
point
,
the
problem
is
that
there
are
now
two
kinematic
states
:
the
currently
estimated
position
and
the
just
received
,
actual
position
.

Resolving
these
two
states
in
a
believable
way
can
be
quite
complex
.

One
approach
is
to
create
a
curve
(
ex
cubic
Bézier
splines
,
Catmull-Rom
splines
,
and
Hermite
curves
)
between
the
two
states
while
still
projecting
into
the
future
.

Another
technique
is
to
use
projective
velocity
blending
,
which
is
the
blending
of
two
projections
(
last
known
and
current
)
where
the
current
projection
uses
a
blending
between
the
last
known
and
current
velocity
over
a
set
time
.

Athyn
Historic
District
Bryn

the
Bryn

Historic
District
,
a
National
Historic
Landmark
District
.

The
Historic
district
includes
four
historic
buildings
:0
.

Cairnwood
Estate
was
built
as
a
family
home
for
the
industrialist
John
Pitcairn
and
his
wife
Gertrude
.

The
building
was
designed
by
renowned
architectural
firm
Carrère
and
Hastings
,
and
the
surrounding
grounds
were
designed
by
Charles
Eliot
of
the
landscape
design
firm
Olmsted
,
Olmsted
and
Eliot
.

The
building
was
eventually
donated
to
the
Academy
of
the
New
Church
,
and
now
serves
as
a
special
events
facility
.

Bryn
Athyn
Cathedral
serves
as
the
episcopal
seat
of
the
General
Church
of
the
New
Jerusalem
,
an
international
Swedenborgian
church
.

Bryn
Athyn
Cathedral
,
built
in
the
early
00th
century
,
is
renowned
for
its
stained
glass
collection
and
for
its
unusual
architecture
,
which
follows
the
arts
and
crafts
tradition
.

Its
construction
was
financed
by
John
Pitcairn
,
and
supervised
by
his
son
,
Raymond
Pitcairn
.

Glencairn
was
originally
the
private
residence
of
millionaire
philanthropist
Raymond
Pitcairn
.

The
castle-like
building
now
serves
the
Academy
of
the
New
Church
and
Bryn
Athyn
College
as
Glencairn
Museum
,
housing
a
collection
of
mostly
religious
artwork
and
artifacts
from
around
the
world
and
is
open
to
the
public
.

Cairncrest
was
built
as
a
home
for
John
Pitcairn
's
son
,
Harold
Pitcairn
,
an
aviation
pioneer
and
developer
of
the
autogyro
.

The
building
now
serves
as
the
central
administrative
offices
for
the
General
Church
of
the
New
Jerusalem
.

Academy
of
the
New
Church
and
Bryn
Athyn
College
Bryn
Athyn
is
also
the
site
of
the
General
Church
affiliated
Academy
of
the
New
Church
,
which
is
the
parent
organization
of
the
Academy
of
the
New
Church
Secondary
Schools
,
Bryn
Athyn
College
,
a
divinity
school
,
and
the
Swedenborg
Library
(
which
was
named
in
honor
of
Emanuel
Swedenborg
)
.

The
New
Church
bases
its
doctrine
on
the
Bible
as
illuminated
by
the
writings
of
this
Swedish
theologian
and
scientist
of
the
eighteenth
century
.

Emanuel
Swedenborg
wrote
such
books
as
Principles
of
Chemistry
,
The
Principia
,
The
Economy
of
the
Animate
Kingdom
and
Arcana
Coelestia
.

Passenger
trains
SEPTA
service
Bryn
Athyn
had
commuter
train
service
until
January
00
,
0000
.

Service
was
suspended
due
to
failing
train
equipment
resulting
in
a
lack
of
ridership
.

As
of
0000
,
the
train
station
is
used
as
the
Bryn
Athyn
post
office
.

Though
rail
service
was
initially
replaced
with
a
Fox
Chase-Newtown
shuttle
bus
,
patronage
remained
light
.

The
replacement
bus
service
was
far
slower
and
less
convenient
than
the
train
service
it
replaced
,
resulting
in
the
shuttle
bus
being
very
unpopular
.

The
travelling
public
never
saw
a
bus
service
as
a
suitable
replacement
for
a
rail
service
.

In
the
ensuing
years
,
there
has
been
interest
in
resuming
passenger
service
by
Bucks
County
officials
.

Neighboring
Montgomery
County
officials
are
supportive
of
re-thinking
the
rail
corridor
as
well
,
though
the
belief
within
SEPTA
management
is
that
the
section
through
Lorimer
Park
and
Walnut
Hill
Station
(
the
only
sparsely
populated
section
along
the
railway
)
will
never
generate
enough
riders
to
be
feasible
.

In
September
0000
,
the
Southampton-based
Pennsylvania
Transit
Expansion
Coalition
(
PA-TEC
)
began
discussions
with
township
officials
along
the
railway
,
as
well
as
SEPTA
officials
,
about
the
realistic
possibility
of
resuming
even
minimal
passenger
service
to
relieve
traffic
congestion
in
the
region
.

Plans
call
for
completing
the
electrification
to
Newtown
,
as
originally
planned
in
the
late
0000s
.

Both
Bucks
and
Montgomery
County
officials
,
as
well
as
state
representatives
,
have
been
receptive
to
PA-TEC
's
efforts
,
despite
SEPTA
's
overall
reservations
.

However
,
SEPTA
has
also
confirmed
that
they
are
indeed
open
to
revisiting
the
line
if
there
is
strong
political
support
in
both
counties
.

0000
wreck
In
Bryn
Athyn
's
railroad
history
,
a
devastating
accident
took
place
in
0000
.

Two
steam
trains
collided
head-on
.

The
boilers
burst
,
sending
red
hot
coals
flying
back
and
raining
down
on
the
wooden
passenger
cars
of
the
two
trains
.

As
a
result
,
over
00
people
were
killed
,
due
in
part
to
the
inability
of
rescue
workers
to
access
the
trains
,
given
that
they
were
wedged
between
two
large
rocks
.

The
incident
led
to
the
ban
on
wooden
rail
cars
in
order
to
prevent
future
disasters
of
a
similar
occurrence
.

Public
education
The
Bryn
Athyn
borough
is
within
the
Bryn
Athyn
School
District
,
which
does
not
operate
any
public
schools
.

00
%

age
children
attend
private
schools
within

district
and
the
remainder
attend
schools
in
neighboring

Conshohocken
(

is
a
borough
on

River
in

a
large
mill
town

center
,
after
the
decline

industry
in

Conshohocken
has
developed

development

It
is
commonly
referred
to
by
its
colloquial
nickname
,
Conshy
.

The
name
'
Conshohocken
'
comes
from
'
Gueno-sheiki-hacking
'
,
meaning
'
Pleasant
Valley
'
in
the
native
language
of
the
Lenape
tribe
of
the

's
native
Americans
who
first
occupied

land
over

In

,
a
New

columnist
noted
lightheartedly
that
"
Some
of
the
residents
of
Conshohocken

are
concerned
because
Kitty
Foyle
's
father
,
in
Christopher
Morley
's
novel
"
Kitty
Foyle
"
(
Lippincott
)
,
uses
the
name
of
their
town
as
a
swear
word
.

Others
think
that
it
may
help
advertise
the
town
.

One
thing
is
sure
—
it
makes
a
rattling
good
cuss-word
.

Riverwalk
Fire
On
Wednesday
,
August
00
,
0000
,
at
approximately
0:00
PM
a
fire
started
at
a
building
site
under
construction
adjacent
(
now
known
as
the
Londonbury
apartments
)
to
the
Riverwalk
Millennium
apartments
in
Conshohocken
,
which
consisted
of
0
different
buildings
.

The
building
under
construction
did
not
have
a
sprinkler
system
yet
in
place
,
allowing
the
fire
to
spread
rapidly
.

Because
of
the
intense
radiant
heat
only
a
few
feet
away
,
the
attics
of
buildings
one
and
four
of
the
Riverwalk
Millennium
Complex
caught
fire
.

The
incident
became
an
0-alarm
blaze
which
destroyed
three
of
the
five
apartment
buildings
.

No
one
was
killed
as
a
result
of
the
fire
,
although
several
firefighters
were
treated
for
minor
injuries
,
and
some
residents
'
pets
were
lost
in
the
blazes
.

Conshohocken
Fire
Chief
Robert
Phipps
referred
to
the
fire
as
"
one
of
the
worst
we
've
had
"
in
the
history
of
the
borough
.

Furthermore
,
Phipps
explained
that
there
were
00
fire
companies
on
site
battling
the
inferno
.

The
amount
of
the
damage
is
unknown
,
but
it
is
estimated
by
property
owner
J.
Brian
O'Neill
to
be
between
$
00
million
and
$
00
million
.

The
cause
of
the
fire
is
believed
to
be
related
to
an
acetylene
torch
which
ignited
at
the
nearby
construction
site
.

An
investigation
is
ongoing

History
Horsham
Township
is
named
after
the
town
of
Horsham
in
the
historic
county
of
Sussex
in
the
South
of
England
.

Horsham
is
one
of
several
townships
in
Montgomery
County
whose
name
and
size
were
determined
by
master
survey
lines
drawn
by
William
Penn
's
engineers
as
they
first
plotted
this
part
of
the
colony
for
sale
and
settlement
.

Parallel
lines
,
projected
at
intervals
of
a
mile
and
a
half
and
extending
in
a
northwesterly
direction
from
settlements
along
the
Delaware
,
served
not
only
as
base
lines
for
measurement
of
individual
land
grants
but
also
as
courses
for
future
highways
.

County
Line
Road
,
Horsham
Road
,
and
Welsh
Road
are
examples
of
highways
so
laid
out
.

The
effect
of
these
survey
lines
upon
the
development
pattern
of
Eastern
Montgomery
County
is
very
much
in
evidence
today
.

In
0000
,
the
entire
township
of
was
made
available
to
individual
purchasers
.

Samuel
Carpenter
,
from
the
town
of
Horsham
in
the
historic
county
of
Sussex
,
England
,
after
which
the
township
is
named
,
purchased
,
within
the
present
boundaries
of
the
township
.

In
0000
,
Carpenter
,
then
Treasurer
of
Pennsylvania
,
began
to
sell
tracts
of
land
to
migrating
Quakers
.

In
0000
,
Horsham
Township
was
established
as
a
municipal
entity
by
a
vote
of
the
people
.

In
0000
,
Sir
William
Keith
,
then
Provincial
Governor
of
Pennsylvania
,
acquired
of
Carpenter
's
land
on
which
he
erected
a
house
in
keeping
with
the
dignity
of
his
office
.

The
development
of
Keith
's
"
plantation
"
proved
to
be
a
step
in
establishing
closer
ties
between
Horsham
and
neighboring
communities
,
particularly
those
of
Hatboro
and
Willow
Grove
.

He
was
responsible
for
the
construction
of
the
present
Easton
Road
(
PA
Highway
000
)
from
the
old
York
Road
junction
at
Willow
Grove
to
his
mansion
on
County
Line
Road
in
0000
.

The
first
significant
settlement
in
the
Township
centered
around
the
junction
of
Horsham
and
Easton
Roads
and
was
known
as
Horshamington
.

Keith
's
extension
of
Easton
Road
prompted
the
establishment
of
the
Horsham
Friends
Meeting
House
.

The
township
's
early
social
and
economic
life
revolved
around
this
Meeting
House
.

In
a
similar
way
,
Prospectville
,
originally
known
as
Cashtown
,
was
established
at
the
junction
of
two
roads
,
Limekiln
Pike
and
Horsham
Road
.

This
portion
of
Limekiln
Pike
was
an
extension
of
the
original
segment
established
in
0000
to
provide
a
thoroughfare
between
Old
York
Road
and
the
limekilns
of
Thomas
Fitzwater
in
Upper
Dublin
Township
.

Prospectville
,
on
a
high
elevation
point
within
the
township
,
offering
a
resting
spot
with
a
tavern
for
those
traveling
along
either
Limekiln
Pike
or
Horsham
Road
.

Here
lived
several
generations
of
the
Simpson
family
,
one
of
whom
was
the
mother
of
Ulysses
S.
Grant
,
the
00th
President
of
the
United
States
.

The
hamlet
of
Davis
Grove
grew
at
the
intersection
of
Keith
's
Road
(
now
called
Governors
Road
)
and
Privet
Road
and
was
once
a
focal
point
of
community
life
.

It
was
here
the
residents
of
the
township
came
to
vote
,
discuss
politics
,
and
attend
community
meetings
.

The
"
Golden
Ball
Inn
"
,
which
at
one
time
was
used
for
housing
guests
of
Governor
Keith
,
enjoyed
much
Revolutionary
splendor
.

The
two
roads
were
formerly
through
links
.

Keith
's
Road
extended
from
Easton
Road
to
Keith
Valley
Road
and
Privet
Road
,
from
Horsham
Road
to
Easton
Road
.

Expansion
of
the
Willow
Grove
Naval
Air
Station
caused
the
closing
of
these
roads
and
the
absorption
of
the
hamlet
.

Today
,
there
are
virtually
no
remaining
signs
of
the
original
settlement
.

Through
most
of
the
early
and
the
middle
00th
Century
,
Horsham
's
population
grew
slowly
.

Its
character
was
not
altered
in
any
significant
way
until
about
0000
,
when
the
North
Pennsylvania
Railroad
extended
a
rail
line
from
Glenside
to
New
Hope
and
established
a
station
in
the
nearby
community
of
Hatboro
,
two
and
three-quarter
miles
east
of
the
nucleus
of
Horshamville
.

Horsham-Hatboro-Byberry
Road
provided
easy
access
to
Hatboro
's
station
and
,
as
a
result
,
residential
development
began
along
the
road
virtually
linking
the
two
communities
together
.

By
0000
,
the
township
's
population
reached
0,000
.

In
0000
,
the
Philadelphia
Rapid
Transit
Company
's
northern
extension
of
the
Philadelphia-Willow
Grove
trolley
service
was
extended
to
Doylestown
along
Easton
Road
from
the
Willow
Grove
Amusement
Park
at
Easton
and
Welsh
Roads
.

This
provided
various
connections
to
other
trolley
lines
.

In
0000
,
aviation
pioneer
,
Harold
F.
Pitcairn
,
purchased
a
large
section
of
farmland
on
the
west
side
of
Doylestown
Pike
(
now
Route
000
)
and
constructed
a
hangar
and
a
grass
airstrip
.

From
0000
to
0000
Pitcairn
used
the
airfield
for
numerous
air
shows
and
to
design
,
construct
and
test
a
number
of
aircraft
,
including
the
Mailwing
which
was
used
by
the
United
States
Postal
Service
to
carry
the
overnight
mail
between
New
York
and
Atlanta
.

In
0000
,
the
United
States
Navy
purchased
what
eventually
became
the
Naval
Air
Station
Joint
Reserve
Base
(
NAS-JRB
)
Willow
Grove
which
contributed
to
national
defense
for
over
six
decades
.

Beginning
with
a
small
group
of
Naval
Aviators
,
maintenance
personnel
,
and
biplanes
and
evolving
into
a
home
for
aircraft
and
personnel
from
every
branch
of
the
United
States
Armed
Forces
,
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
maintained
the
finest
traditions
of
excellence
and
service
.

The
men
and
women
assigned
to
and
trained
at
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
answered
the
call
of
their
nation
in
time
of
peace
,
war
and
crisis
.

In
0000
,
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
was
selected
for
closure
by
BRAC
0000
law
.

In
late
0000
,
the
Horsham
Township
Authority
for
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
(
HLRA
)
was
selected
as
the
Local
Redevelopment
Authority
(
LRA
)
,
and
was
charged
with
preparing
the
required
reuse
planning
documents
.

In
0000
,
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
was
officially
closed
,
00
years
after
the
base
and
its
iconic
hangars
arose
from
the
farm
fields
of
Montgomery
County
,
Pennsylvania
.

The
Navy
and
Marine
Corps
squadrons/units
moved
to
McGuire
Air
Force
Base
in
0000
.

The
000th
Fighter
Wing
of
the
PA
Air
National
Guard
remains
at
their
present
site
along
with
Army
Reserve
and
Army
National
Guard
units
on
the
former
U.S.
Air
Force
Reserve
Center
facility
.

The
U.S.
Army
Reserve
,
Pennsylvania
Air
National
Guard
,
and
Pennsylvania
Army
National
Guard
units
are
located
on
the
approximately
000-acre
base
that
is
located
near
the
intersection
of
County
Line
and
Easton
Roads
.

The
name
of
the
installation
is
“
Horsham
Air
Guard
Station
”
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
Horsham
Township
Authority
for
NAS-JRB
(
HLRA
)
submitted
the
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
Redevelopment
Plan
and
Homeless
Assistance
Submission
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(
HUD
)
and
the
Navy
.

The
plan
includes
many
developments
popular
with
area
residents
including
small
nature
and
conservation
parks
,
an
aviation
museum
,
and
town
center
;
but
,
the
plan
includes
some
highly
unpopular
developments
such
as
a
conference
center
and
hotel
on
the
site
.

The
redevelopment
of
the
000-acres
of
surplus
property
at
the
former
base
has
been
touted
by
developers
as
"
an
unprecedented
opportunity
for
Horsham
Township
to
establish
a
vibrant
place
for
residents
to
live
,
work
,
play
and
raise
a
family
within
their
community
.
"

Once
the
land
is
transferred
,
the
surplus
property
will
comprise
approximately
0
%
of
the
Township
’s
total
land
area
.

With
proper
planning
,
the
redevelopment
of
the
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
will
become
a
centerpiece
for
economic
development
within
the
Township
and
surrounding
region
.

The
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
Redevelopment
Plan
details
the
existing
conditions
,
issues
and
opportunities
,
and
recommendations
that
will
guide
the
Horsham
Township
Authority
for
NAS-JRB
Willow
Grove
in
the
redevelopment
process
.

King
of
Prussia
is
a
census-designated
place
in
Upper
Merion
Township
,
Montgomery
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
its
population
was
00,000
.

The
community
took
its
name
in
the
00th
century
from
a
local
tavern
named
the
King
of
Prussia
Inn
,
which
was
named
after
Frederick
II
,
King
of
Prussia
.

Like
the
rest
of
Montgomery
County
,
King
of
Prussia
continues
to
experience
rapid
development
.

The
largest
shopping
mall
in
the
United
States
in
terms
of
space
and
size
,
the
King
of
Prussia
Mall
,
is
located
here
.

Also
located
here
is
the
headquarters
of
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
Region
I
.

History
The
eponymous
King
of
Prussia
Inn
was
originally
constructed
as
a
cottage
in
0000
by
the
Welsh
Quaker
s
William
and
Janet
Rees
,
founders
of
nearby
Reeseville
.

The
cottage
was
converted
to
an
inn
in
0000
and
did
a
steady
business
in
colonial
times
as
it
was
approximately
a
day
's
travel
by
horse
from
Philadelphia
.

Settlers
headed
west
to
Ohio
would
sleep
at
the
inn
on
their
first
night
on
the
road
.

In
0000
the
Rees
family
hired
James
Berry
to
manage
the
inn
,
which
henceforth
became
known
as
"
Berry
's
Tavern
"
.

General
George
Washington
first
visited
the
tavern
on
Thanksgiving
Day
in
0000
while
the
Continental
Army
was
encamped
at
Whitemarsh
;
a
few
weeks
later
Washington
and
the
army
bivouacked
at
nearby
Valley
Forge
.

Parker
's
spy
map
,
created
by
a
Tory
sympathizer
of
the
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
,
listed
the
inn
as
"
Berry
's
"
in
0000
,
but
a
local
petition
in
0000
identified
it
as
the
"
King
of
Prussia
"
.

It
was
possibly
renamed
in
honor
of
Benjamin
Franklin
's
pro-American
satirical
essay
"
An
Edict
by
the
King
of
Prussia
"
.

At
some
point
a
wooden
signboard
of
the
inn
depicted
King
Frederick
II
(
Frederick
the
Great
)
of
Prussia
.

The
inn
is
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

The
inn
was
forced
to
move
with
the
expansion
of
U.S.
Route
000
.

US
000
is
a
major
north-south
highway
that
passes
through
the
town
from
southwest
to
northeast
.

Its
construction
as
a
modern
expressway
would
have
caused
the
destruction
of
the
King
of
Prussia
Inn
;
however
,
historic
preservationists
managed
to
prevail
upon
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
to
avoid
this
important
structure
by
building
north
and
southbound
lanes
on
either
side
of
it
.

For
more
than
a
quarter
century
the
inn
was
marooned
on
a
median
island
,
with
motor
traffic
whizzing
past
on
both
sides
.

It
was
sealed
up
for
years
,
surrounded
by
a
high
fence
.

The
inn
was
successfully
relocated
in
0000
and
opened
to
the
public
in
October
0000
.

The
extensive
suburb
an
development
that
has
taken
place
since
the
0000s
in
King
of
Prussia
has
led
urban
planning
scholars
like
Joel
Garreau
to
label
the
area
as
an
epitome
of
the
edge
city
phenomenon
,
a
situation
where
the
most
vibrant
economic
growth
and
prosperity
in
a
metropolitan
area
(
in
this
case
,
Philadelphia
)
no
longer
occurs
in
the
urban
center
,
but
rather
at
its
periphery
.

Before
0000
,
the
Greater
King
of
Prussia
area
was
known
for
little
more
than
being
the
place
of
Washington
's
winter
respite
in
0000-0
(
see
Valley
Forge
National
Historical
Park
)
.

Daniel
Berrigan
and

Philip

began

Movement
at

General
Electric

Plant
in

in

as
well
as

of

Infrastructure
King
of
Prussia
has
retained
its
role
as
an
important
crossroads
throughout
United
States
history
.

In
addition
to
the
Inn
,
from
the
earliest
days
,
the
intersection
supported
two
general
stores
.

Today
,
four
major
highway
s
meet
in
or
near
the
center
of
King
of
Prussia
.

The
Schuylkill
Expressway
(
I-00
)
from
Center
City
,
Philadelphia
,
ends
in
King
of
Prussia
at
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
,
an
east-west
toll
road
across
the
southern
portion
of
the
state
.

US

begins
near
the
center
of
town
and
heads
west
to
Reading
;
thanks
to
reconstruction
in
0000
,
motorists
can
now
travel
directly
from
Reading
to
Philadelphia
without
passing
onto
US

.

US

is
the
only
major
highway
that
becomes
a
surface
road
through
the
area
.

The
construction
of
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
shopping
malls
,
thousands
of
homes
,
various
hotels
and
highrises
,
strip
malls
,
restaurants
,
freeways
,
a
convention
center
,
and
much
more
has
caused
King
of
Prussia
to
become
a
highly
developed
community
.

One
unfortunate
side
effect
of
the
rapid
development
over
the
last
several
decades
is
that
the
plumbing
and
water
drainage
infrastructure
is
now
barely
able
to
handle
the
volume
,
leading
to
periodic
water
back
ups
for
homes
.

The
depth
of
this
was
shown
on
a
larger
scale
in
October
and
November
0000
when
the

place
to
live
with
some

older

Much

King
of
Prussia
is
home
to
the
King
of
Prussia
Mall
,
the
largest
shopping
complex
in
the
United
States
,
based
on
shopping
area
square

.

(
The
Mall
of
America
in
Bloomington
,
Minnesota
,
is
the
largest
when

is
included
.
)

King
of
Prussia
comprises
two
malls
which
are
connected
by
a
short
covered
crosswalk
,
originally
developed
and
operated
by
Kravco
Company
,
now
owned
and
managed
by
Simon
Property
Group
.

The

at

originally
opened
in

,
and
was
under
a
continual
expansion
until
0000
.

The
Court
at
King
of
Prussia
,
comprising
GLA
connected
by
an
open-air
walkway
to
The
Plaza
,
opened
in
0000
.

The
Plaza
was
renovated
and
expanded
between
0000
–
0000
,
to
include
nearly
GLA
.

The
Court
was
renovated
during
0000
.

When
the
Strawbridge
's
department
store
at
the
far
end
of
the
Court
became
vacant
in
the
late
0000s
,
the
original
Kravco
partners
bought
the
building
.

Kravco
Company
re-tenanted
it
with
big-box
store
s
and
restaurants
such
as
The
Cheesecake
Factory
,
reducing
GLA
slightly
,
renaming
that
portion
of
The
Court
"
The
Pavilion
.
"

Thus
the
total
GLA
at
King
of
Prussia
is
in
the
vicinity
of
GLA
,
depending
on
the
source
used
,
making
it
the
largest

complex
in

under
one
ownership
in

acres

naming
conventions

time
,
it
should

immediately
surrounding
the
train
station
was
owned
by
the
Jenkins
family
,

there
was
already
a
town
by

is
a
township
in
Montgomery
County
,
Pennsylvania
,

States
about
00
miles
(

)
northwest
of

History
The
name
"
Pottsgrove
"
originated
from
the
00th
century
estate
of
John
Potts
,
who
built
a
stone
mansion
in
Stowe
(
now
in
West
Pottsgrove
Township
)
.

After
the
American
Revolution
's
Battle
of
Brandywine
in
0000
,
part
of
the
Potts
Estate
became
an
encampment
for
George
Washington
's
troops
.

The
encampment
,
known
as
Camp
Pottsgrove
,
lasted
about
two
weeks
until
Washington
's
troops
moved
on
to
the
battle
of
Germantown
.

The
name
Camp
Pottsgrove
stayed
even
after
the
troops
moved
out
.

Pottsgrove
Township
was
formed
in
0000
.

Lower
Pottsgrove
separated
from
Pottsgrove
Township
and
became
a
second-class
Township
on
December

,
0000
,
with
the
remainder
being
called
Upper
Pottsgrove
.

Following
its
split
from

Pottsgrove
,
Lower
Pottsgrove
Township
experienced
several
annexations
of
territory
from
the
neighboring
Pottstown
Borough
.

On
January

,
0000
,
the
Borough
of
Pottstown
annexed
two
portions
of

Township
:
from
Moser
to
Porter
Road
and
an
area
bounded
by
Prospect
to
Mervine
and
Adams
to
Charlotte
Streets
because
Pottstown
believed
“
the
township
had
been
taking
tax
money
for
years
and
giving
nothing
in
return
.

”
In
0000
,
Pottstown
annexed
a
little
more
than
five
acres
bounded
by
North
Hills
Boulevard
,
Mulberry
Street
and
Keim
Street
.

In
November
0000
,
the
voters
of
Lower
Pottsgrove
Township
supported
the
Township
becoming
a
first-class
Township
for
the
primary
purpose
of
preventing
further
annexation
by
the
Borough
of
Pottstown
.

Lower
Pottsgrove
Township
became
a
first-class
township
on
January

communities
and
large

outlying
townships
,
Norristown
's
retail
sector
steadily
declined

eventually
collapsed

the
city
's
economy
is
powered
by

County
government
jobs
,
the
legal
profession
,
and
health
care
.

Montgomery
Hospital
and

State
Hospital
are
located

Politics
and
government
Norristown
has
been
a
home
rule
municipality
since
0000
when
a
Home
Rule
Charter
with
a
manager/council
form
of
government
and
a
seven-member
municipal
council
went
into
effect
.

The
office
of
mayor
was
abolished
in
July
0000
after
a
public
referendum
amended
the
municipal
charter
.

The
municipality
is
part
of
the
Sixth
Congressional
District
(
represented
by
Rep.
Jim
Gerlach
)
,
the
00th
and
000th
State
House
Districts
(

Vereb
)
and

(

.

Norristown
is
currently
involved
in
a
federal
lawsuit
,
Briggs
v.
Borough
of
Norristown
et
al.
,
over
their
disorderly
behavior
ordinance
.

The
ordinance
allows
the
city
to
penalize
landlords
and
have
the
tenants
evicted
after
the
police
have
been
called
three
or
more
times
for
domestic
disturbances
in
a
four
month
period
.

The
law
classes
domestic
disturbances
as
a
form
of
"
disorderly
behavior
,
"
which
requires
the
police
to
enforce
the
law
.

The
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
believes
this
creates
an
atmosphere
in
which
victims
of
domestic
abuse
would
no
longer
want
to
report
their
abuse
due
to
repercussions
from
the
city
.

The
ACLU
states
this
may
violate
the
victim
's
First
Amendment
rights
and
also
the
federal
Violence
Against
Women
Act
.

's
surrender
at

Court
House
.

One

the
house
and
most
of
the
remaining
property
.

The
mansion
however
,
along

its
contents
of
period
objects
,
was
offered
in

to
the
state

County
and
borough
of
Norristown
.

Unfortunately
,
none
took
the
generous
offer

were
snatched
up
by
bargain
hunters
.

At
the
last
moment
the
house
was
saved
from
the
wrecker
's
ball
.

The

was
formed
to
purchase
the
house
and
transform
it
into
a
focal
point
of
pride
for
not

of
the
county
seat

also
all

North
Wales
is
a
borough
in
Montgomery
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

It
is
a
suburb
of
Philadelphia
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
is
one
of
the
three
historic
population
centers
that
make
up
the
North
Penn
Valley
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Like
many
small
boroughs
in
Pennsylvania
,
North
Wales
is
at
"
build
out
"
,
meaning
that
its
boundaries
have
not
kept
up
with
population
growth
.

Summarily
,
many
businesses
and
residences
with
North
Wales
addresses
are
located
in
outlying
townships
that
were
never
annexed
by
the
borough
,
such
as
the
Montgomery
Mall
in
Montgomery
Township
.

North
Wales
is
in
the
North
Penn
School
District
.

Location
North
Wales
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

History
As
its
name
suggests
,
North
Wales
was
settled
by
Welsh
immigrants
who
named
it
after
North
Wales
in
Wales
.

(
For
more
on
Welsh
settlements
in
colonial
Pennsylvania

"
Welsh
Tract
"
.
)

Part
of
a
0000
William
Penn
land
grant
,
this
rich
farming
country
was
given
the
name
"
Gwynedd
"
for
the
homeland
of
the
earliest
settlers
and
it
began
as
a
pastoral
village
in
agricultural
Gwynedd
Township
.

Before
0000
,
a
number
of
farms
,
plus
a
0000
church
,
shared
by
the
Lutheran
and
Reformed
congregations
,
dotted
the
present
borough
's
landscape
.

What
is
now
Main
Street
was
originally
an
old
Indian
trail
,
and
was
laid
out
as
the
Great
Road
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
it
had
become
today
's
Sumneytown
Pike
,
and
was
a
toll
road
until
0000
.

It
had
always
been
an
important
route
to
Philadelphia
,
and
continues
to
serve
as
a
connection
to
Routes
000
and
000
to
the
east
and
the
Northeastern
Extension
of
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
to
the
west
.

Its
rural
character
was
abruptly
disrupted
by
the
building
of
the
North
Pennsylvania
Railroad
starting
in
0000
.

Service
from
Bethlehem
to
Philadelphia
through
North
Wales
began
in
0000
.

The
town
quickly
grew
around
the
railroad
station
,
with
hotels
and
restaurants
lining
Walnut
Street
and
Main
Street
within
walking
distance
.

North
Wales
is
the
oldest
of
the
North
Penn
boroughs
,
incorporated
in
0000
,
by
taking
land
from
today
's
Upper
Gwynedd
Township
,
then
the
northern
portion
of
Gwynedd
Township
.

Some
of
the
large
homes
at
the
start
of
the
00th
century
were
opened
to
summer
guests
from
the
city
.
"

Idlewilde
"
,
still
present
on
Main
Street
,
hosted
the
Emperor
of
Brazil
,
Dom
Pedro
II
,
when
he
was
visiting
Philadelphia
to
open
the
0000
U.S.
Centennial
Exhibition
with
President
Ulysses
S.
Grant
.

During
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
century
,
much
of
North
Wales
borough
's
housing
was
built
.

Most
houses
along
South
Main
Street
between
Montgomery
and
Prospects
Streets
remain
much
as
they
were
when
built
and
are
lovingly
maintained
.

The
borough
also
features
a
variety
of
single
family
homes
,
as
well
as
twins
,
and
rowhomes
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
Lehigh
Valley
Transit
Company
operated
its
Chestnut
Hill
Branch
trolley
line
,
which
connected
North
Wales
to
surrounding
towns
through
service
to
either
Philadelphia
or
Allentown
.

The
trolley
ran
down
Main
Street
through
the
borough
,
but
detoured
onto
Pennsylvania
Avenue
for
two
blocks
to
enable
it
to
cross
the
North
Penn
Railroad
on
a
bridge
.

The
bridge
was
required
because
the
railroad
,
citing
safety
concerns
,
refused
to
allow
the
trolleys
to
cross
at
the
Main
Street
grade
crossing
.

Lehigh
Valley
Transit
Company
's
combined
passenger/freight
station
was
located
on
the
north
(
east
)
side
of
Pennsylvania
Avenue
between
Shearer
Street
and
Montgomery
Avenue
.

After
Main
Street
trolley
service
ended
in
0000
,
Lehigh
Valley
Transit
high-speed
trolleys
continued
to
serve
the
Wales
Junction
station
,
located
on
Sumneytown
Pike
three-quarters
of
a
mile
west
of
town
.

High-speed
trolley
serviced
ended
in
September
0000
.

Passenger
rail
service
to
North
Wales
is
currently
provided
by
SEPTA
.

Many
North
Wales
residents
commute
to
Center
City
,
Philadelphia
by
the
Lansdale/Doylestown
Line
train
.

The
0000s-vintage
brick
railroad
station
,
thoroughly
restored
in
0000
,
is
open
weekdays
from
0
a.m.
to
0
p.m.
.

In
0000
,
the
North
Wales
Historic
Preservation
District
was
established
by
Borough
Council
and
the
Pennsylvania
Historic
and
Museum
Commission
to
protect
the
architecture
that
is
a
visual
reminder
of
the
borough
's
past
.

It
is
the
first
Historic

in
the
North
Penn

.

During
this
time
,
Maud
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
,
Dorothy
,
followed
by
three
more
sons
,
Arthur
,
Richard
and
George
.

In
0000
,
the
family
decided
that
they
would
emigrate
to
Austin
's
native
Pennsylvania
and
resettle
in
North
Wales
.

They
first
traveled
north
from
Africa
to
London
,
where
Maud
's
parents
lived
.

During
their
stay
in
London
,
Maud
fell
ill
and
it
was
decided
that
Austin
would
go
ahead
with
James
and
Walter
while
Maud
,
Dorothy
,
and
the
younger
boys
would
remain
in
London
with
Maud
's
parents
while
she
recovered
.

Austin
and
his
two
eldest
sons
boarded
the
Titanic
at
Southampton
on
April
00
,
0000
,
aboard
which
they
were
travelling
in
Third
Class
.

Tragically
,
Austin
along
with
both
James
and
Walter
perished
in
the
sinking
.

In
the
following
weeks
,
the
cable-laying
ship
Mackay
Bennett
was
dispatched
from
Halifax
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
recover
the
dead
,
and
the
first
body
recovered
was
identified
as
that
of
nine-year-old
Walter
.

Austin
's
body
was
recovered
from
the
North
Atlantic
a
few
days
later
,
but
James
was
never
found
.

The
two
bodies
recovered
were
sent
to
North
Wales
after
being
collected
by
Austin
's
father
,
and
interred
in
the
family
plot
at
Union
Cemetery
at
Zion
Lutheran
Church
in
nearby
Flourtown
,
Pennsylvania
.

Maud
,
devastated
and
heartbroken
by
the
loss
of
her
husband
and
two
eldest
children
,
was
still
determined
to
make
a
life
for
herself
and
her
family
in
America
,
and
in
February
0000
,
Maud
and
her
four
remaining
children
sailed
to
New
York
aboard
the
White
Star
Line
's
Oceanic
and
settled
in
North
Wales
permanently
.

Oreland
is
a
United
States
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
in
Springfield
and
Upper
Dublin
townships
,
just
outside
of
the
Chestnut
Hill
and
Mount
Airy
areas
of
Philadelphia
,
Pennsylvania
.

Oreland
has
a
ZIP
code
of
00000
,
and
the
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Geography
Oreland
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
CDP
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

History
Oreland
,
as
part
of
Springfield
Township
,
was
settled
as
one
of
William
Penn
's
manors
.

In
0000
,
a
man
named
Thomas
Fitzwater
discovered
vast
lime
deposits
on
his
land
in
Oreland
.

He
erected
a
kiln
to
process
it
,
which
by
0000
had
attracted
the
attention
of
William
Penn
.

Penn
ordered
a
highway
built
from
the
port
of
the
Delaware
River
to
the
kiln
.

Named
Limekiln
Pike
,
and
still
in
existence
today
,
it
was
one
of
the
first
roads
in
the
area
.

These
lime
deposits
and
the
ore
deposits
also
found
in
the
area
gave
Oreland
its
name
.

Mining
and
farming
would
dominate
Oreland
's
economy
until
the
00th
century
,
when
Oreland
transformed
into
a
residential
suburb
of
Philadelphia
,
as
it
remains
today
.

The
village
of
Oreland
was
not
laid
out
until
0000
near
the
North
Penn
Railroad
running
along
the
east
side
of
town
(
currently
SEPTA
's
Lansdale
/
Doylestown
Line
)
.

The
Plymouth
Railroad
ran
from
Conshohocken
to
Oreland
through
Plymouth
and
Flourtown
.

The
tracks
were
mostly
removed
in
the
0000s
.

The
path
where
the
trains
used
to
run
begins
northeast
of
the
Oreland
Station
Apartments
,
next
to
Ehrenpfort
Road
,
and
runs
southwest
towards
Flourtown
.

The
actual
tracks
,
which
still
connect
to
SEPTA
's
Lansdale/Doylestown
Line
,
end
near
the
corner
of
Montgomery
Avenue
and
Lyster
Road
.

The
path
continues
all
the
way
to
Flourtown
,
although
in
the
0000s
the
path
was
cut
at
Oreland
Mill
Road
by
housing
built
on
both
sides
.

The
remainder
of
the
path
today
is
used
primarily
by
children
,
runners
and
bikers
.

Johann
Strauss
II
(
October
00
,
0000
–
June
0
,
0000
)
,
also
known
as
Johann
Baptist
Strauss
or
Johann
Strauss
,
Jr.
,
the
Younger
,
or
the
Son
(
)
,
was
an
Austria
n
composer
of
light
music
,
particularly
dance
music
and
operetta
s.
He
composed
over
000
waltz
es
,
polka
s
,
quadrille
s
,
and
other
types
of
dance
music
,
as
well
as
several
operettas
and
a
ballet
.

In
his
lifetime
,
he
was
known
as
"
The
Waltz
King
"
,
and
was
largely
then
responsible
for
the
popularity
of
the
waltz
in
Vienna
during
the
00th
century
.

Strauss
had
two
younger
brothers
,
Josef
and
Eduard
Strauss
,
who
became
composers
of
light
music
as
well
,
although
they
were
never
as
well
known
as
their
elder
brother
.

Some
of
Johann
Strauss
's
most
famous
works
include
The
Blue
Danube
,
Kaiser-Walzer
,
Tales
from
the
Vienna
Woods
,
and
the
Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka
.

Among
his
operettas
,
Die
Fledermaus
and
Der
Zigeunerbaron
are
the
best
known
.

Early
life
Strauss
was
born
in
St.
Ulrich
near
Vienna
(
now
a
part
of
Neubau
)
,
Austria
,
on
October
00
,
0000
,
to
the
composer
Johann
Strauss
I
.

His
paternal
great-grandfather
was
a
Hungarian
Jew
–
a
fact
which
the
Nazis
,
who
lionised
Strauss
's
music
as
"
so
German
"
,
later
tried
to
conceal
.

His
father
did
not
want
him
to
become
a
musician
but
rather
a
banker
.

Nevertheless
,
Strauss
Junior
studied
the
violin
secretly
as
a
child
with
the
first
violinist
of
his
father
's
orchestra
,
Franz
Amon
.

When
his
father
discovered
his
son
secretly
practising
on
a
violin
one
day
,
he
gave
him
a
severe
whipping
,
saying
that
he
was
going
to
beat
the
music
out
of
the
boy
.

It
seems
that
rather
than
trying
to
avoid
a
Strauss
rivalry
,
the
elder
Strauss
only
wanted
his
son
to
escape
the
rigours
of
a
musician
's
life
.

It
was
only
when
the
father
abandoned
his
family
for
a
mistress
,
Emilie
Trampusch
,
that
the
son
was
able
to
concentrate
fully
on
a
career
as
a
composer
with
the
support
of
his
mother
.

Strauss
studied
counterpoint
and
harmony
with
theorist
Professor
Joachim
Hoffmann
,
who
owned
a
private
music
school
.

His
talents
were
also
recognized
by
composer
Joseph
Drechsler
,
who
taught
him
exercises
in
harmony
.

His
other
violin
teacher
,
Anton
Kollmann
,
who
was
the
ballet
répétiteur
of
the
Vienna
Court
Opera
,
also
wrote
excellent
testimonials
for
him
.

Armed
with
these
,
he
approached
the
Viennese
authorities
to
apply
for
a
license
to
perform
.

He
initially
formed
his
small
orchestra
where
he
recruited
his
members
at
the
Zur
Stadt
Belgrad
tavern
,
where
musicians
seeking
work
could
be
hired
easily
.

Debut
as
a
composer
Johann
Strauss
I
's
influence
over
the
local
entertainment
establishments
meant
that
many
of
them
were
wary
of
offering
the
younger
Strauss
a
contract
for
fear
of
angering
the
father
.

Strauss
Jr.
was
able
to
persuade
the
Dommayer
's
Casino
in
Hietzing
,
a
suburb
of
Vienna
,
to
allow
him
to
perform
.

The
elder
Strauss
,
in
anger
at
his
son
's
disobedience
,
and
at
that
of
the
proprietor
,
refused
to
ever
play
at
the
Dommayer
's
Casino
again
,
which
had
been
the
site
of
many
of
his
earlier
triumphs
.

Strauss
made
his
debut
at
Dommayer
's
in
October
0000
,
where
he
performed
some
of
his
first
works
,
such
as
the
waltzes
"
Sinngedichte
"
,
Op
.

0
and
"
Gunstwerber
"
,
Op
.

0
and
the
polka
"
Herzenslust
"
,
Op
.

Critics
and
the
press
were
unanimous
in
their
praise
for
Strauss
's
music
.

A
critic
for
Der
Wanderer
commented
that
"
Strauss
’s
name
will
be
worthily
continued
in
his
son
;
children
and
children
’s
children
can
look
forward
to
the
future
,
and
three-quarter
time
will
find
a
strong
footing
in
him
.
"

Despite
the
initial
fanfare
,
Strauss
found
his
early
years
as
a
composer
difficult
,
but
he
soon
won
over
audiences
after
accepting
commissions
to
perform
away
from
home
.

The
first
major
appointment
for
the
young
composer
was
his
award
of
the
honorary
position
of
"
Kapellmeister
of
the
0nd
Vienna
Citizen
's
Regiment
"
,
which
had
been
left
vacant
following
Joseph
Lanner
's
death
two
years
before
.

Vienna
was
wracked
by
a
bourgeois
revolution
on
February
00
,
0000
,
and
the
intense
rivalry
between
father
and
son
became
much
more
apparent
.

Johann
Jr.
decided
to
side
with
the
revolutionaries
.

It
was
a
decision
that
was
professionally
disadvantageous
,
as
the
Austrian
royalty
twice
denied
him
the
much
coveted
'
KK
Hofballmusikdirektor
'
position
,
which
was
first
designated
especially
for
Johann
I
in
recognition
of
his
musical
contributions
.

Further
,
the
younger
Strauss
was
also
arrested
by
the
Viennese
authorities
for
publicly
playing
"
La
Marseillaise
"
,
but
was
later
acquitted
.

The
elder
Strauss
remained
loyal
to
the
monarchy
,
and
composed
his
"
Radetzky
March
"
,
Op
.

000
(
dedicated
to
the
Habsburg
field
marshal
Joseph
Radetzky
von
Radetz
)
,
which
would
become
one
of
his
best-known
compositions
.

When
the
elder
Strauss
died
from
scarlet
fever
in
Vienna
in
0000
,
the
younger
Strauss
merged
both
their
orchestras
and
engaged
in
further
tours
.

Later
,
he
also
composed
a
number
of
patriotic
marches
dedicated
to
the
Habsburg
Emperor
Franz
Josef
I
,
such
as
the
"
Kaiser
Franz-Josef
Marsch
"
Op
.

00
and
the
"
Kaiser
Franz
Josef
Rettungs
Jubel-Marsch
"
Op
.

000
,
probably
to
ingratiate
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
new
monarch
,
who
ascended
to
the
Austrian
throne
after
the
0000
revolution
.

Career
advancements
Strauss
Jr.
eventually
surpassed
his
father
's
fame
,
and
became
one
of
the
most
popular
waltz
composers
of
the
era
,
extensively
touring
Austria-Hungary
,
Poland
,
and
Germany
with
his
orchestra
.

He
applied
for
the
KK
Hofballmusikdirektor
Music
Director
of
the
Royal
Court
Balls
position
,
which
he
eventually
attained
in
0000
,
after
being
denied
several
times
before
for
his
frequent
brushes
with
the
local
authorities
.

In
0000
,
due
to
constant
mental
and
physical
demands
,
Strauss
suffered
a
nervous
breakdown
.

He
took
a
seven-week
vacation
in
the
countryside
in
the
summer
of
that
year
,
on
the
advice
of
doctors
.

Johann
's
younger
brother
Josef
was
persuaded
by
his
family
to
abandon
his
career
as
an
engineer
and
take
command
of
Johann
's
orchestra
in
the
interim
.

In
0000
,
Strauss
accepted
commissions
from
the
management
of
the
Tsarskoye-Selo
Railway
Company
of
Saint
Petersburg
to
play
in
Russia
for
the
Vauxhall
Pavilion
at
Pavlovsk
in
0000
.

He
would
return
to
perform
in
Russia
every
year
until
0000
.

Later
,
in
the
0000s
,
Strauss
and
his
orchestra
toured
the
United
States
,
where
he
took
part
in
the
Boston
Festival
at
the
invitation
of
bandmaster
Patrick
Gilmore
and
was
the
lead
conductor
in
a
'
Monster
Concert
'
of
over
0000
performers
,
performing
his
"
Blue
Danube
"
waltz
,
amongst
other
pieces
,
to
great
acclaim
.

Marriages
Strauss
married
the
singer
Henrietta
Treffz
in
0000
,
and
they
remained
together
until
her
death
in
0000
.

Six
weeks
after
her
death
,
Strauss
married
the
actress
Angelika
Dittrich
.

Dittrich
was
not
a
fervent
supporter
of
his
music
,
and
their
differences
in
status
and
opinion
,
and
especially
her
indiscretion
,
led
him
to
seek
a
divorce
.

Strauss
was
not
granted
a
divorce
by
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
,
and
therefore
changed
religion
and
nationality
,
and
became
a
citizen
of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
in
January
0000
.

Strauss
sought
solace
in
his
third
wife
Adele
Deutsch
,
whom
he
married
in
August
0000
.

She
encouraged
his
creative
talent
to
flow
once
more
in
his
later
years
,
resulting
in
many
famous
compositions
,
such
as
the
operetta

Musical
rivals
and
admirers
Although
Strauss
was
the
most
sought-after
composer
of
dance
music
in
the
latter
half
of
the
00th
century
,
stiff
competition
was
present
in
the
form
of
Karl
Michael
Ziehrer
and
Émile
Waldteufel
;
the
latter
held
a
commanding
position
in
Paris
.

Phillip
Fahrbach
also
denied
the
younger
Strauss
the
commanding
position
of
the
KK
Hofballmusikdirektor
when
the
latter
first
applied
for
the
post
.

The
German
operetta
composer
Jacques
Offenbach
,
who
made
his
name
in
Paris
,
also
posed
a
challenge
to
Strauss
in
the
operetta
field
.

Strauss
was
admired
by
other
prominent
composers
:
Richard
Wagner
once
admitted
that
he
liked
the
waltz
"
Wein
,
Weib
und
Gesang
"
Op
.

Richard
Strauss
(
unrelated
to
the
Strauss
family
)
,
when
writing
his
Rosenkavalier
waltzes
,
said
in
reference
to
Johann
Strauss
,
"
How
could
I
forget
the
laughing
genius
of
Vienna
?
"

Johannes
Brahms
was
a
personal
friend
of
Strauss
;
the
latter
dedicated
his
waltz
"
Seid
umschlungen
,
Millionen
!

"
(
"
Be
Embraced
,
You
Millions
!
"
)

000
,
to
him
.

A
story
is
told
in
biographies
of
both
men
that
Strauss
's
wife
Adele
approached
Brahms
with
a
customary
request
that
he
autograph
her
fan
.

It
was
usual
for
the
composer
to
inscribe
a
few
measures
of
his
best-known
music
,
and
then
sign
his
name
.

Brahms
,
however
,
inscribed
a
few
measures
from
the
"
Blue
Danube
"
,
and
then
wrote
beneath
it
:
"
Unfortunately
,
NOT
by
Johannes
Brahms
.
"

Stage
works
The
most
famous
of
Strauss
'
operettas
are
Die
Fledermaus
,
Eine
Nacht
in
Venedig
,
and
Der
Zigeunerbaron
.

There
are
many
dance
pieces
drawn
from
themes
of
his
operettas
,
such
as
"
Cagliostro-Walzer
"
Op
.

000
(
from
Cagliostro
in
Wien
)
,
"
O
Schöner
Mai
"
Walzer
Op

000
(
from
Prinz
Methusalem
)
,
"
Rosen

Süden
"
Walzer
Op
.

000
(
from
Das
Spitzentuch
der
Königin
)
,
and
"
Kuss-Walzer
"
op
.

000
(
from
Der
lustige
Krieg
)
,
that
have
survived
obscurity
and
become
well-known
.

Strauss
also
wrote
an
opera
,
Ritter
Pázmán
,
and
was
in
the
middle
of
composing
a
ballet
,
Aschenbrödel
,
when
he
died
in
0000
.

Death
and
legacy
Strauss
was
diagnosed
with
pleural
pneumonia
in
the
spring
of
0000
,
and
died
in
Vienna
,
at
the
age
of
00
.

He
was
buried
in
the
Zentralfriedhof
.

At
the
time
of
his
death
,
he
was
still
composing
his
ballet
Aschenbrödel
.

Strauss
's
music
is
now
regularly
performed
at
the
annual
Neujahrskonzert
of
the
Vienna
Philharmonic
Orchestra
,
as
a
result
of
the
efforts
by
Clemens
Krauss
who
performed
a
special
all-Strauss
programme
in
0000
with
the
Viennese
orchestra
.

Many
distinguished
Strauss
interpreters
include
Willi
Boskovsky
,
who
carried
on
the
"
Vorgeiger
"
tradition
of
conducting
with
violin
in
hand
,
as
is
the
Strauss
family
custom
,
as
well
as
Herbert
von
Karajan
and
the
opera
conductor
Riccardo
Muti
.

In
addition
,
the
Wiener
Johann
Strauss
Orchester
,
which
was
formed
in
0000
,
pays
tribute
to
the
touring
orchestras
which
once
made
the
Strauss
family
so
famous
.

Most
of
the
Strauss
works
that
are
performed
today
may
once
have
existed
in
a
slightly
different
form
,
as
Eduard
Strauss
destroyed
much
of
the
original
Strauss
orchestral
archives
in
a
furnace
factory
in
Vienna
's
Mariahilf
district
in
0000
.

Eduard
,
then
the
only
surviving
brother
of
the
three
,
took
this
drastic
precaution
after
agreeing
to
a
pact
between
himself
and
brother
Josef
that
whoever
outlived
the
other
was
to
destroy
their
works
.

The
measure
was
intended
to
prevent
the
Strauss
family
's
works
from
being
claimed
by
another
composer
.

This
may
also
have
been
fueled
by
Strauss
's
rivalry
with
another
of
Vienna
's
popular
waltz
and
march
composers
,
Karl
Michael
Ziehrer
.

Portrayals
in
the
media
The
lives
of
the
Strauss
dynasty
members
and
their
world-renowned
craft
of
composing
Viennese
waltzes
are
also
briefly
documented
in
several
television
adaptations
,
such
as
The
Strauss
Family
(
0000
)
,
The
Strauss
Dynasty
(
0000
)
and
Strauss
,
the
King
of
0/0
Time
(
0000
)
.

Many
other
films
used
his
works
and
melodies
,
and
several
films
have
been
based
upon
the
life
of
the
musician
,
the
most
famous
of
which
is
called
The
Great
Waltz
(
0000
)
.

Alfred
Hitchcock
made
a
low-budget
biographical
film
of
Strauss
in
0000
called
Waltzes
from
Vienna
.

After
a
trip
to
Vienna
,
Walt
Disney
was
inspired
to
create
four
feature
films
.

One
of
those
was
The
Waltz
King
,
a
loosely
adapted
biopic
of
Johann
Strauss
,
which
aired
as
part
of
the
Wonderful
World
of
Disney
in
the
U.S.
in
0000
.

In
Mikhail
Bulgakov
's
0000
(
published
0000
)
novel
,
The
Master
and
Margarita
,
Johann
Strauss
conducts
the
orchestra
during
Satan
's
Great
Ball
at
the
invitation
of
Behemoth
.

A
Corny
Concerto
(
0000
)
,
a
Warner
Bros
cartoon
,
directed
by
Bob
Clampett
with
animation
by
Robert
McKimson
,
features
music
that
was
composed
by
Johann
Strauss
,
and
is
a
parody
of
Walt
Disney
's
0000
Fantasia
.

The
cartoon
is
narrated
by
Elmer
Fudd
,
parodying
Deems
Taylor
's
appearance
in
Fantasia
.

The
0000
animated
short
"
Johann
Mouse
"
from
the
series
Tom
and
Jerry
features
a
mouse
mesmerised
by
the
playing
of

History
The
township
was
originally
settled
by
members
of
the
Religious
Society
of
Friends
,
or
Quakers
,
who
worshipped
in
the
Plymouth
Friends
Meetinghouse
.

They
sailed
from
Devon
shire
,
England
,
on
the
ship
Desire
,
arriving
in
Philadelphia
on
June
00
,
0000
.

The
township
takes
its
name
from
the
settlers
'
hometown
of
Plymouth
in
Devon
.

What
is
now
Germantown
Pike
was
ordered
laid
out
by
the
Provincial
Government
in
0000
as
a
"
cart
road
"
from
Philadelphia
to
Plymouth
Meeting
.

The
actual
road
was
not
finished
until
0000
,
when
it
was
built
at
a
cost
of
$
00,000
.

A
road
from
Plymouth
Meeting
to
Gwynedd
appears
to
have
been
built
in
0000
.

What
is
now
Chemical
Road
,
following
Plymouth
Creek
,
was
opened
in
0000
to
provide
access
to
a
new
gristmill
.

In
the
early
00th
century
the
Hickorytown
Hotel
,
on
Germantown
Pike
opposite
Hickory
Road
,
was
a
prominent
road
house
.

Robert
Kennedy
,
an
officer
in
the
Revolution
,
operated
the
inn
in
0000
.

In
0000
it
was
kept
by
Frederick
Dull
and
in
0000
,
Jacob
Hart
.

In
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
it
was
a
training
place
for
the
00th
Regiment
of
the
Pennsylvania
Militia
and
the
Second
Battalion
of
Montgomery
County
.

The
Friendship
Company
for
the
Protection
against
Horse
Stealing
was
organized
there
in
0000
.

Township
elections
were
held
there
as
well
,
and
a
post
office
was
established
there
in
May
0000
.

The
Plymouth
Meeting
Post
Office
appears
to
have
been
established
sometime
prior
to
0000
.

In
0000
,
Benjamin
Davis
received
a
license
to
keep
an
inn
on
Ridge
Pike
at
Plymouth
Creek
.

This
inn
,
the
Seven
Stars
,
was
shown
on
maps
as
early
as
0000
.

The
inn
was
demolished
in
0000
to
make
way
for
the
Midcounty
Expressway
.

Early
records
indicate
that
one
person
was
elected
as
"
road
supervisor
"
and
tax
collector
.

The
roads
were
mostly
dirt
,
and
the
repair
and
maintenance
was
often
auctioned
off
to
the
lowest
bidder
,
usually
a
farmer
who
had
large
properties
and
kept
many
men
and
horses
,
and
the
smaller
farmers
worked
on
the
roads
for
them
.

Tax
records
show
that
the
taxpayers
had
the
privilege
of
working
out
their
taxes
on
the
roads
.

From
0000
to
0000
the
road
supervisor
was
paid
one
dollar
per
day
for
his
work
as
supervisor
and
collector
of
taxes
.

Men
working
on
the
roads
received
$
.00
per
day
and
boys
received
$
.00
per
day
.

For
the
use
of
a
double
team
of
horses
with
a
wagon
or
cart
,
one
was
paid
$
0.00
per
day
.

Among
the

was
the
Hickorytown
Forge
operated
by
the
Wood
family
,
and
a
forerunner
of
the
present
Alan
Wood
Steel
Company
.

The
name
Plymouth

appears
in
the
records
about

and
was
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
nails
.

In

was
organized
with
a

History
Modern-day
Pottstown
is
established
on
land
originally
deeded
to
William
Penn
.

Germans
,
Swedes
and
English
were
among
the
first
settlers
in
the
area
.

After
establishment
of
the
first
iron
forge
in
0000
,
Pottstown
's
fortunes
became
tied
to
the
iron
industry
.

Eventually
,
blast
furnaces
for
production
of
iron
and
later
steel
opened
in
the
area
.

Iron
and
steel
production
brought
the
Potts
family
,
iron
masters
by
trade
,
to
the
area
.

They
established
a
forge
in
the
area
and
built
a
large
home
just
west
of
the
Manatawny
Creek
.

John
Potts
founded
a
town
in
0000
on
part
of
the
that
he
owned
.

Over
time
,
Pottsgrove
grew
and
in
0000
,
was
incorporated
under
the
name
Pottstown
becoming

second
borough
in
Pennsylvania
after
Norristown
.

The
Philadelphia
&
Reading
Railroad
mainline
between
Reading
and
Philadelphia
reached
Pottstown
in
0000
.

The
extension
of
the
railroad
to
Mount
Carbon
in
0000
facilitated
the
movement
of
raw
materials
and
finished
goods
which
helped
Pottstown
's
economy
to
grow
.

In
the
few
years
following
the
extension
of
the
railroad
,
the
population
grew
from
000
to
0,000
residents
.

Pottstown
's
metal
production
grew
and
notably
,
steel
from
the
borough
was
used
in
the
Panama
Canal
and
Golden
Gate
Bridge
.

In
0000
,
the
borough
adopted
a
city
manager
form
of
government
.

By
0000
,
the
borough
saw
the
need
to
re-organize
the
municipal
government
.

At
the
time
,
it
had
one
of
the
largest
borough
councils
in
the
state
,
with
00
members
.

This
was
reduced
to
seven
members
in

History
In
0000
,
German
farmers
in
the
Electorate
of
the
Palatinate
began
to
immigrate
to
Philadelphia
in
such
numbers
that
Benjamin
Franklin
wrote
an
editorial
fearing
that
Philadelphia
would
become
a
German-speaking
city
.

The
city
fathers
told
the
newly-arrived
German
immigrates
that
they
would
have
to
settle
up
the
Schuylkill
River
in
the
area
that
is
now
known
as
Germantown
.

As
the
Germantown
area
became
settled
,
later
arrivals
settled
further
up
the
Schuylkill
and
continued
up
Perkiomen
Creek
and
Skippack
Creek
to
a
point
where
travel
by
boat
became
impossible
because
of
shallow
water
.

This
point

Creek
crosses

Van
Bebber

land
patent
was
issued
in

by

Penn.

.

Skippack
Township

Strauss
took
lessons
in

violin
and

secure
a
place
in
a
local
orchestra
of
Michael
Pamer
which
he
eventually
left
in
order
to
join
a
popular
string
quartet
known
as
the
Lanner
Quartet
formed
by
his
would-be
rival
Joseph
Lanner
and
the
Drahanek
brothers
,
Karl
and
Johann
.

This
string
quartet
playing
Viennese
waltzes
and
rustic
German
dances
expanded
into
a
small
string
orchestra
in
0000
.

He
eventually
became
deputy
conductor
of
the
orchestra
to
assist
Lanner
in
commissions
after
it
became
so
popular
during
the
Fasching
of
0000
and
Strauss
was
soon
placed
in
command
of
a
second
smaller
orchestra
which
was
formed
as
a
result
of
the
success
of
the
parent
orchestra
.

In
0000
,
he
decided
to
form
his
own
band
and
began
to
write
music
(
chiefly
,
dance
music
)
for
it
to
play
after
he
realized
that
he
could
also
possibly
emulate
the
success
of
Lanner
in
addition
to
putting
an
end
to
his
financial
struggles
.

By
so
doing
,
he
would
have
made
Lanner
a
serious
rival
although
the
rivalry
did
not
entail
hostile
consequences
as
the
musical
competition
was
very
productive
for
the
development
of
the
waltz
as
well
as
other
dance
music
in
Vienna
.

He
soon
became
one
of
the
best-known
and
well
loved
dance
composers
in
Vienna
,
and
he
toured
with
his
band
to
Germany
,
the
Netherlands
,
Belgium
and
Britain
.

The
conducting
reins
and
management
of
this
'
Strauss
Orchestra
'
would
eventually
be
passed
over
to
the
hands
of
his
sons
variously
until
its
disbandment
by
Eduard
Strauss
in
0000
.

On
a
trip
to
France
in
0000
he
heard
the
quadrille
and
began
to
compose
them
himself
,
becoming
largely
responsible
for
introducing
that
dance
to
Austria
in
the
0000
Fasching
,
where
it
became
very
popular
.

It
was
this
very
trip
(
in
0000
)
which
has
proved
Strauss
'
popularity
with
audiences
from
different
social
backgrounds
and
this
paved
the
way
to
forming
an
ambitious
plan
to
perform
his
music
in
England
for
the
coronation
of
Queen
Victoria
in
0000
.

Strauss
also
adapted
various
popular
melodies
of
his
day
into
his
works
so
as
to
ensure
a
wider
audience
,
as
evidenced
in
the
incorporation
of
the
Oberon
overture
into
his
early
waltz
,
"
Wiener
Carneval
"
,
Op
.

0
,
and
also
the
French
national
anthem
"
La
Marseillaise
"
into
his
"
Paris-Walzer
"
,
Op
.

Strauss
married
Maria
Anna
Streim
in
0000
in
the
parish
church
of
Liechtenthal
in
Vienna
.

The
marriage
was
relatively
unhappy
due
to
his
prolonged
absences
caused
by
frequent
tours
abroad
which
led
to
a
gradual
alienation
.

The
family
home
was
called
'
Hirschenhaus
'
but
was
better
known
in
Vienna
as
the
'
Goldener
Hirsch
'
(
The
Golden
Stag
)
.

Strauss
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
demanded
that
none
of
his
sons
pursue
careers
in
music
,
despite
them
displaying
musical
talent
.

Johann
Junior
was
to
study
banking
,
likewise
his
brother
Josef
Strauss
was
destined
for
a
military
career
,
whereas
the
youngest
Eduard
Strauss
was
expected
to
join
the
Austrian
consulate
.

By
0000
Strauss
had
taken
a
mistress
,
Emilie
Trampusch
,
with
whom
he
had
six
children
.

When
her
husband
openly
acknowledged
his
paternity
of
a
daughter
born
to
Emilie
in
0000
,
Maria
Anna
sued
for
divorce
.

With
the
ending
of
the
marriage
Anna
Strauss
determined
to
further
Johann
Strauss
II
's
musical
career
,
allowing
him
to
develop
his
skills
as
a
composer
.

Despite
family
problems
,
Strauss
senior
continued
to
tour
frequently
and
was
always
prepared
to
write
novelty
pieces
for
numerous
charitable
organizations
.

His
waltzes
were
gradually
developed
from
a
rustic
peasant
dance
into
one
which
posterity
would
recognize
as
the
Viennese
Waltz
.

They
were
written
in
three-quarter
time
with
a
short
introduction
;
often
with
little
or
no
reference
to
the
later
chain
of
five
two-part
waltz
structure
;
usually
appended
with
a
short
coda
and
concluded
in
a
stirring
finish
,
although
his
son
Johann
Strauss
II
expanded
the
waltz
structure
and
utilized
more
instruments
than
his
father
.

While
he
did
not
possess
a
musical
talent
as
rich
as
his
eldest
son
's
,
nor
a
business
mind
as
astute
,
he
was
among
the
handful
of
early
waltz
composers
along
with
Joseph
Lanner
to
actively
write
pieces
with
individual
titles
—
with
the
view
to
boost
sales
of
their
sheet
music
—
which
enabled
music
enthusiasts
to
easily
recognize
those
pieces
.

In
fact
,
during
his
performances
at
the
Sperl-Ballroom
in
Vienna
,
where
he
established
his
name
,
he
actively
pursued
the
concept
of
collecting
a
fixed
entrance
fee
from
the
patrons
of
the
ballroom
instead
of
the
old
practice
of
passing
around
a
collection
plate
where
income
was
reliant
on
the
goodwill
of
the
patrons
.

Johann
Strauss
II
often
played
his
father
's
works
and
openly
declared
his
admiration
of
them
,
although
it
was
no
secret
to
the
Viennese
that
their
rivalry
was
intense
,
with
the
press
at
that
time
fueling
it
.

Johann
Strauss
I
himself
refused
to
play
ever
again
at
the
Dommayer
's
Casino
,
which
offered
his
son
his
conducting
debut
,
and
was
to
tower
over
his
son
during
his
lifetime
in
terms
of
career
advancement
,
although
Strauss
II
was
to
eclipse
him
in
terms
of
popularity
in
the
classical
repertoire
.

In
0000
,
Johann
Strauss
I
was
awarded
the
honorary
title
of
K.K.
Hofballmusikdirektor
(
Director
of
Music
for
the
Imperial
and
Royal
Court
Balls
)
by
Emperor
Ferdinand
I
.

Strauss
died
in
Vienna
in
0000
from
scarlet
fever
contracted
from
one
of
his
illegitimate
children
.

He
was
buried
at
the
Döblinger
cemetery
beside
his
friend
Joseph
Lanner
.

In
0000
,
both
of
their
remains
were
transferred
to
the
graves
of
honour
at
the
Zentralfriedhof
.

The
former
Döbling
Cemetery
is
now
a
Strauss-Lanner
Park
.

Hector
Berlioz
himself
paid
tribute
to
the
'
Father
of
the
Viennese
Waltz
'
by
commenting
that
"
Vienna
without
Strauss
is
like
Austria
without
the
Danube
"
.

History
Founding
]
The
first
settlers
,
of
German
,
Welsh
,
and
Dutch
descent
,
arrived
in
Towamencin
Township
around
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
.

They
mainly
pursued
agricultural
endeavors
to
sustain
their
livelihood
.

The
first
grant
of
land
in
Towamencin
Township
was
in
0000
from
William
Penn
's
Commissioners
to
Benjamin
Furley
on
June
0
.

The
Commissioners
granted
0,000
acres
(
0
km
²
)
to
him
.

On
June
00
of
that
same
year
,
Abraham
Tennis
and
Jan
Lucken
bought
the
property
from
him
,
and
then
divided
the
land
in
half
in
0000
.

The
Edward
Morgan
Log
House
stands
on
land
that
was
part
of
000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
granted
to
Griffith
Jones
by
the
Commissioners
.

Edward
Morgan
purchased
000
acres
(
0.00
km
²
)
of
this
land
,
which
included
an
existing
"
dwelling
house
"
,
from
Griffith
Jones
on
February
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
his
daughter
Sarah
,
who
in
0000
would
give
birth
to
the
famous
frontiersman
Daniel
Boone
,
married
Squire
Boone
.

The
land
containing
the
house
was
then
deeded
to
John
Morgan
,
son
of
Edward
,
on
August
00
,
0000
as
part
of
a
000
acre
(
.00
km
²
)
tract
.

In
March
0000
the
settlers
of
the
area
petitioned
William
Penn
's
Commissioners
for
Towamencin
to
become
a
Township
.

The
request
was
granted
and
a
charter
given
.

The
land
was
surveyed
and
recorded
,
outlining
the
boundaries
of
the
Township
,
known
as
antioch
.

Those
boundaries
are
similar
to
what
they
are
today
.

In
the
enumeration
of
0000
there
were
00
landholders
within
the
Township
,
with
William
Tennis
having
the
most
area
at
000
acres
(
0

)
.

The
Indians
of
Towamencin
]
The
American
Indians
who
inhabited
the
area
were
the
Lenni
Lenape
.

They
lived
in
Pennsylvania
,
as
well
as
Delaware
,
New
Jersey
,
and
parts
of
Maryland
.

They
were
divided
into
three
tribes
:
the
Turtle
,
Turkeys
,
and
Wolf
,
which
were
subdivided
into
clans
,
each
clan
having
a
name
representing
the
character
and
situation
of
the
tribe
as
a
whole
.

The
Indians
of
Towamencin
Township
are
of
the
Delaware
Nation
.

They
had
a
settlement
in
the
southwest
section
of
the
Township
along
the
Towamencin
Creek
.

They
established
friendly
relations
with
the
settlers
when
they
came
to
the
Township
.

There
are
some
accounts
of
violence
attributed
to
the
Indians
,
but
they
can
not
be
proven
and
are
probably
fictional
.

There
are
many
accounts
of
Indians
helping
to
tend
the
sick
,
and
trading
food
and
goods
with
the
settlers
.

It
is
not
recorded
when
the
tribes
of
Indians
left
Towamencin
;
it
is
suspected
they
left
after
the
Revolutionary
War
.

known
as

for
its
role
in
the
Revolution
,
and
as
one
of
the
oldest
settlements
during
the
time
,
Towamencin
Township
played
a
part
:
the
Township
had
encampments
of
soldiers
,
had
many
citizens
that
served
,
and
was
the
retreating
place
for
General
Washington
and
his
troops
after
the
Battle
of
Germantown
.

The
Continental
Army
troops
were
in

,
0000
to
October
00
,
0000
and
camped
in
the
Northern
section
of
the
Township
.

The
Township
provided
a
secure
area
to
rest
,
without
fear
of
surprise
attack
by
the
British
.

Washington
commandeered
Frederick
Wampole
's
house
to
establish
his
quarters
and
conducted
military
duties
from
there

Township
Strategic
Plan
The
Towamencin
Township
Board
of
Supervisors
recognized
the
need
for
a
Five-Year
Strategic
Plan
during
the
0000
budget
process
.

In
early
0000
the
Board
authorized
the
formation
of
a
Strategic
Planning
Committee
.

A
committee
of
five
residents
,
two
supervisors
,
and
the
Township
Manager
was
formed
in
late
February
,
charged
with
developing
a
Five-Year
Strategic
Plan
and
a
goal
of
completing
it
in
time
for
the
0000
budget
process
.

The
committee
expanded
to
six
residents
in
mid-May
.

The
committee
began
weekly
meetings
in
March
0000
,
starting
with
the
task
of
developing
a
Community
Vision
and
Mission
Statement
.

They
then
received
planning
inputs
from
all
Department
Heads
and
the
Township
Manager
.

At
the
end
of
the
input
process
,
the
committee
developed
Priorities
,
which
were
then
voted
on
by
each
member
of
the
committee
for
prioritization
.

The
committee
then
developed
Goals
,
Sustainability
Objectives
and
Implementation
Tools
and
Techniques
for
each
of
the
Priorities
,
segmenting
them
by
areas
of
the
Township
Budget
.

The
Strategic
Plan
was
then
briefed
to
the
Board
of
Supervisors
00
August
0000
by
Mr.
Fred
Seipt
,
who
represented
the
entire
committee
.

The
plan
was
accepted
and
approved
by
the
Board
of
Supervisors
00
September
0000
.

The
Strategic
Plan
has
been
updated
every
year
since
.

Name
The
name
Towamencin
is
of
Native
American
origin
,
and
means
"
Poplar
Tree
"
.

An
alternate
etymology
is
a
legend
associated
started
in
the
0000s
when
Heinrich
Fry

two
men
clearing
trees
near
the
creek
and
said
"
Towha-men-seen
"
,
meaning
"
Two
men
seen

Pennsylvania
,
United

History
Whitemarsh
was
originally
inhabited
by
the
Lenni
Lenape
tribe
of
Native
Americans
.

It

first
settled
by
European
colonists
in
0000
,
as
part
of
a
tract
of
land
purchased
from
William
Penn
by
Major
Jasper
Farmar
.

Though
Major
Jasper
Farmer
died
before
making
the
voyage
to
his
new
land
,
his
widow
and
family
sailed
,
with
servants
,
to
Philadelphia
in
0000
.

They
established
their
homestead
in
Fort
Washington
.

After
the
Widow
Farmer
died
sometime
in

0000s
,
her
son
Edward
began
to
sell
000
to
000
acre
pieces
of
the
township
to
Quakers
and
German
immigrants
.

In
0000
,
the
discovery
of
limestone
in
nearby
Oreland
drew
settlers
to
Whitemarsh
,
as
did
subsequent
discoveries
of
Limestone
in
the
township
.

Whitemarsh
Township
was
incorporated
in
0000
as
part
of
Philadelphia
County
and
was
one
of
the

original

that
comprised
Montgomery
County
when

History
Whitpain
is
one
of
the
oldest
townships
in
Montgomery
County
.

Richard
Whitpaine
,
a
London
butcher
,
purchased
a
tract
of
land
as
part
of
William
Penn
’s
"
Holy
Experiment
"
.

His
00-year
old
son
,
Zechariah
,
travelled
to
Pennsylvania
on
the
ship
Welcome
with
Penn
in
0000
to
settle
his
father
's
properties
and
escape
persecution
of
his
Quaker
beliefs
.

By
0000
,
Zechariah
had
established
a
plantation
house
along
Wissahickon
Creek
near
Mount
Pleasant
,
with
his
bride
Sarah
Songhurst
,
whom
he
had
met
on
the
Welcome
.

In
Holme
’s
Map
of
0000
,
Whitpain
Township
is
called
Whitpain
’s
Creek
.

By
0000
,
when
William
Penn
ordered
a
survey
of
all
the
townships
in
the
Commonwealth
,
it
appeared
in
public
records
as
Whitpain
’s
Township
.

The
borders
of
Whitpain
Township
changed
dramatically
in
0000
,
when
Worcester
Township
was
created
,
taking
away
a
chunk
of
land
.

By
0000
,
Whitpain
Township
had
00
landowners
.

It
maintained
steady
growth
for
more
than
two
centuries
,
expanding
from
000
people
in
0000
to
0,000
people
in
0000
.

In
recent
years
,
the
township
has
experienced
rapid
growth
.

Today
,
Whitpain
Township
is
home
to
over
00,000
residents
.

Early
settlers
to
Whitpain
Township
were
farmers
.

Industry
came
to
the
region
in
0000
,
when
Jacob
Yost
began
a
weaving
enterprise
in
Centre
Square
.

Charles
Mather
built
an
additional
mill
in
0000
.

Although
a
rural
farming
community
for
decades
,
the
growth
of
recent
years
has
included
business
development
,
making
Whitpain
Township
home
to
several
of
the
Philadelphia
region
’s
largest
corporations
,
including
Aetna
US
Healthcare
and
Unisys
.

Although
today
Whitpain
Township
is
home
to
residents
of
many
religions
and
nationalities
,
its
earliest
settlers
were
Protestant
and
Quaker
.

Prior
to
the
Revolutionary
War
,
the
township
had
two
churches
:
Boehm
’s
Reformed
Church
(
circa
0000
)
,
and
St.
John
’s
Lutheran
Church
(
circa
0000
)
.

Whitpain
Township
earned
a
place
in
history
during
the
Revolutionary
War
,
when
George
Washington
and
many
of
his
generals
spent
time
in
the
township
.

In
fact
,
Dawesfield
,
a
home
on
Lewis
Lane
,
is
considered
the
most
significant
historic
site
in
the
township
,
because
it
was
Washington
’s
headquarters
from
October
00
to
November
0
,
0000
.

Whitpain
Township
has
been
an
independent
township
since
0000
.

However
,
for
a
brief
period
in
0000
,
Whitpain
and
Plymouth
townships
,
by
act
of
the
assembly
,
became
one
district
with
one
supervisor
from
each
township
.

Dissatisfaction
by
the
populace
of
both
townships
dissolved
the
act
in
0000
.

Dawesfield
was
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

History
Willow
Grove
's
history
spans
nearly
three
centuries
.

Following
a
land
grant
established
by
William
Penn
,
known
as
the
Manor
of
Moreland
,
the
first
home
was
built
in
0000
.

The
colonial
farmstead
slowly
grew
into
a
small
rural
community
.

By
the
mid-00th
century
,
Willow
Grove
served
as
a
summer
vacation
retreat
for
Philadelphia
residents
.

Dr.
Nicholas
More
,
an
English
friend
and
business
associate
of
William
Penn
,
was
granted
0,000
acres
of
land
at
an
annual
rent
of
a
silver
shilling
for
every
000
acres
.

Originally
known
as
“
the
Manor
of
Moreland
”
,
it
became
the
Township
of
Moreland
in
0000
.

The
name
officially
became
Willow
Grove
about
0000
when
it
appeared
on
a
map
of
Pennsylvania
townships
.

The
planting
of
willow
trees
to
absorb
the
surrounding
swampland
strengthened
the
decision
to
give
Willow
Grove
its
name
.

The
Willow
Grove
area
enjoys
its
place
in
Revolutionary
War
history
,
as
well
.

Washington
’s
troops
marched
through
Willow
Grove
in
0000
on
their
way
to
the
Battle
of
Brandywine
,
and
the
famous
Battle
of
Crooked
Billet
took
place
in
the
vicinity
of
Hatboro
.

The
Willow
Grove
area
was
also
a
major
player
in
the
efforts
of
the
Underground
Railroad
during
the
Civil
War
.

Old
York
Road
was
a
primary
route
through
Pennsylvania
,
leading
slaves
to
freedom
in
Canada
.

As
with
many
early
communities
,
Willow
Grove
experienced
rapid
growth
and
development
,
thanks
to
railroad
and
trolley
expansion
toward
the
end
of
the
00th
,
and
early
00th
centuries
.

Less
than
a
day
’s
trip
away
from
Philadelphia
and
attracted
by
the
country
,
more
and
more
inns
and
restaurants
sprang
up
.

The
economy
enjoyed
a
growth
spurt
and
the
Willow
Grove
area
blossomed
.

“
Life
is
a
lark
in
Willow
Grove
Park
”
With
travel
and
accommodations
readily
available
and
to
stimulate
travel
on
the
increasingly
popular
trolleys
,
the
Philadelphia
Rapid
Transit
Company
decided
to
build
an
amusement
park
in
Willow
Grove
,
at
the
end
of
the
line
.

Thus
was
born
Willow
Grove
Park
in
0000
,
the
prototype
for
numerous
parks
that
followed
across
the
country
.

The
Park
also
enjoyed
its
reputation
as
the
“
Music
Capital
of
America
”
with
orchestras
and
bands
,
especially
John
Philip
Sousa
,
who
was
a
regular
in
the
band
shell
starting
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
more
than
000,000
people
attended
Sousa
’s
last
annual
concert
in
the
park
,
after
twenty-five
years
of
making
music
in
the
area
.

In
0000
,
Willow
Grove
Park
gave
way
to
innovation
and
progress
once
again
,
when
it
was
razed
to
make
way
for
a
new
retail
concept
–
the
mall
.

Thus
Willow
Grove
Park
Mall
was
born
.

As
they
had
since
the
early
days
,
the
residents
of
Willow
Grove
were
ready
once
again
to
innovate
and
grow
.

History
William
Penn
,
the
founder
of
Pennsylvania
,
reserved
Springfield
Township
as
one
of
his
family
's
original
manors
in
the
0000s
.

Wyndmoor
,
originally
called
"
Tedyuscung
"
,
is
the
subject
of
many
Native
American
legends
.
"

Wyndmoor
"
was
originally
the
name
of
the
estate
of
Randal
Morgan
,
who
made
a
fortune
in
oil
and
purchased
property
adjacent
to
the
present
SEPTA
Wyndmoor
Station
about
0000
.

The
estate
's
name
eventually
replaced
the
name
"
Springfield
Village
"
for
the
small
collection
of
shops
and
houses
just
east
of
Stenton
Avenue
,
and
finally
encompassed
the
entire
residential
area
east
of
Stenton
Avenue
.

Wyndmoor
was
the
site
of
Whitemarsh
Hall
,
the
estate
of
banking
executive
Edward
T.
Stotesbury
.

The
estate
became
a
housing
development
in
the
late
0000s
,
and
the
000-room
mansion
was
demolished
in
0000
,
but
the
columns
of
its
portico
and
pieces
of
statuary
survive
in
the
neighborhoods
of
Wyndmoor
.

The
Stotesbury
Club
House
and
John
Welsh
House
are
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

Wyndmoor
Hose
Company
Wyndmoor
Hose
Company
No.
0
was
formed
in
0000
and
chartered
in
0000
.

The
seeds
of
the
local
fire
company
grew
out
of
an
industrial
base
at
Mermaid
Lane
and
Queen
Street
.

There
,
the
Nelson
Valve
Company
began
an
in-house
fire
brigade
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
dangerous
industrial
mechanisms
used
to
make
hydraulic
valves
.

Eventually
,
the
local
community
was
solicited
for
its
help
in
keeping
this
fire
unit
viable
and
expanding
its
services
to
the
larger
community
.

Residents
volunteered
,
recognizing
the
communal
benefit
,
and
with
help
from
the
valve
company
a
two
wheeled
had
cart
was
purchased
and
000
feet
of
hose
.

By
0000
,
the
shed
used
at
the
valve
Company
was
expanded
as
were
the
hose
carts
to
four
wheels
and
two
horses
.

Horse
power
proved
a
problem
.

A
monetary
reward
was
granted
to
the
first
horse
team
to
arrive
at
the
sound
of
the
alarm
and
haul
the
apparatus
to
the
scene
.

This
actually
produced
a
rivalry
among
horse
teams
!

At
the
dawn
of
the
Roaring
Twenties
the
fire
company
got
a
new
home
,
on
Queen
Street
closer
to
Willow
Grove
Ave.
It
still
stands
and
served
as
a
firehouse
for
nearly
00
years
.

In
0000
,
Wyndmoor
purchased
two
Hale
Pumpers
and
in
0000
a
city
service
ladder
truck
.

As
the
nations
infant
automotive
industry
diversified
and
began
to
specialize
,
communities
began
purchasing
recognizable
fire
apparatus
.

A
huge
property
along
Willow
Grove
Ave.
was
purchased
by
the
fire
company
and
large
fairs
were
held
for
a
dozen
years
.

The
proceeds
from
these
carnivals
offset
astronomical
costs
and
allowed
the
continued
modernization
of
the
fire
service
in
Wyndmoor
.

Wyndmoor
Hose
Company
is
a
000
%
volunteer
department
.

The
fifty-plus
members
who
make
up
the
working
force
are
notified
by
digital
paging
systems
,
day
and

,

.

Beyond
fire
suppression
activities
,
WHCo
is
active
in
the
community
in
many
other
ways
.

Fire
prevention
programs
have
always
been
a
primary
focus
.

The
company
keeps
a
busy
schedule
with
weekend
birthday
parties
held
at
the
station
,
sometimes
multiple
parties
each
day
.

The
parties
often
include
a
00-00
minute
presentation
on
fire
safety
.

Throughout
the
year
WHCo
presents
fire
prevention
programs
to
local
schools
,
camps
,
day-care
facilities
,
and
other
businesses
and
organizations
.

Annual
demonstrations
are
made
to
The
Boy
Scouts
of
America
to
display
not
only
safety
messages
,
but
also
drunk-driving
warnings
.

Equally
importantly
,
WHCo
has
forged
a
relationship
,
approaching
almost
a
decade
long
,
with
UCP
-
United
Cerebral
Palsy
.

UCP
is
a
nearby
organization
who
provides
direct
services
to
over
0,000
adults
,
children
and
their
families
with
a
variety
of
disabilities
including
cerebral
palsy
,
head
trauma
,
stroke
and
spinal
cord
injury
.

Groups
of
Wyndmoor
firefighters
can
be
found
at
any
one
of
UCP
's
six
annual
fundraising
events
.

Monday
nights
are
busy
nights
for
Wyndmoor
volunteers
.

Almost
fifty
weeks
a
year
,
Wyndmoor
firefighters
meet
Mondays
from
0:00
PM
through
0:00
PM
to
maintain
,
test
,
practice
,
discuss
,
and
plan
for
fire
and
rescue-related
events
.

Beyond
these
evenings
,
special
joint
training
sessions
might
be
scheduled
for
weekends
or
other
evenings
throughout
the
year
.

While
all
firefighters
must
engage
in
no
less
than
eighty
hours
of
academy
training
before
stepping
foot
on
a
fireground
,
the
reality
holds
true
that
the
training
never
ends
.

In
the
late
0000s
it
was
decided
that
the
fire
company
would
add
emergency
medical
services
to
its
already
expanded
list
of
rescue
operations
.

The
company
purchased
the
QRS
(
Quick
Response
Service
)
unit
that
houses
enough
basic
life
support
and
first-aid
equipment
to
complement
the
Springfield
Ambulance
Association
's
arrival
.

Shortly
after
WHCo
sent
a
crew
to
Ground
Zero
following
September
00
,
0000
's
terrorist
activities
,
the
Hazardous
Materials
operation
also
expanded
.

Wyndmoor
teamed
with
HazMat
000
as
Eastern
Montgomery
County
's
primary
decontamination
service
.

A
larger
environmental
response
trailer
was
purchased
to
accommodate
the
increased
quantity
of
equipment
needed
.

A
much
more
in-depth
training
program
was
enforced
and
all
WHCo
members
were
required
to
complete
advanced
levels
of
hazardous
materials
training
.

Today
Wyndmoor
Hose
Company
,
No.
0
is
equipped
to
respond
to
virtually
any
emergency
.

From
building
fire
to
vehicle
rescue
,
from
hazardous
material
to
emergency
medical
situations
,
Wyndmoor
has
personnel
that
are
well-trained
and
highly-skilled
prepared
to

,
Chester
County
native
and
American
Revolutionary
War
figure
William
Montgomery
purchased
a
plot
of
land
in

and
established
a
trading
post
called
Montgomery
's
Landing
.

In
0000
he
constructed
a
house
there
,
which
is
now
a
small
museum
inside
the
town
.

In
the
same
year
his
son
Daniel
plotted
the
area
between
Mill
Street
and
Church
Street
,
the
historic
core
of
the

center
in
the
00th
century
,
served
by
several
railroad
s
and
the
North
Branch
of
the

Coal
and
iron
mines
in

hills
and
mountains
fueled
the
local
economy
,

Danville
was
an

,
however
,
as
steel
replaced
iron
in

century
.

The
city
celebrates
this
era
with
an
annual
Iron
Heritage
Festival
in

,
and
the
main
street
is
still
named
"
Mill
Street
"
.

In
0000
the
Danville
State
Hospital
was
built
as
a
state
institution
for
the
treatment
and
care
of
the
insane
.

Abigail
Geisinger
,
widow
of
iron
magnate
George
Geisinger
,
used
his
fortune
to

medical
center
modeled
after
the
Mayo
Clinic
.

The

,
the
Geisinger
Medical
Center
is
the
most
important
tertiary
referral

History
The

fort
stood
somewhere
near

Run
and
the

Creek
meet
.

During

century
,
millionaire
Frank
DeLong
would

facilities

the
country
,
to
the
town
.

He
also
turned
the
old
Presbyterian
Church
into
a
memorial
for
his
mother
.

Today
,
the

school
building
is
now
a

Mr.

had
many
charming
qualities

among

story
told
in
glass
pained
windows
,
an
enchantress
disguised
as
an
old
beggar
woman
offers
a
young
unkind
prince
a
rose
in
exchange
for
a
night
's
shelter
.

When
he
coldly
turns
her
away
,
she
punishes
him
by
transforming
him
into
an
hideous
beast
and
turning
his
servants
into
household
items
,
because
he
has
no
love
in
his
heart
.

She
gives
him
a
magic
mirror
that
enables
him
to
view
faraway
events
,
along
with
the
rose
,
which
will
bloom
until
his
00st
birthday
.

He
must
love
and
be
loved
in
return
before
the
rose
's
petals
have
fallen
off
,
lest
he
remain
a
beast
forever
.

Years
later
,
a
beautiful
young
woman
named
Belle
lives
in
a
nearby
French
village
with
her
father
Maurice
,
an
inventor
who
people
believe
to
be
crazy
.

Belle
loves
reading
and
yearns
for
a
life
beyond
the
village
,
where
every
morning
was
the
same
as
before
.

Her
beauty
and
non-conformity
attracts
attention
in
the
town
and
she
is
pursued
by
many
men
,
but
mostly
the
arrogant
local
hunter
,
Gaston
,
who
is
set
on
marrying
her
.

Despite
being
sought
after
by
single
females
and
considered
godlike
in
perfection
by
the
male
population
of
the
town
,
Belle
is
uninterested
in
Gaston
.

As
Maurice
travels
to
a
fair
to
present
his
wood-chopping
machine
,
he
gets
lost
on
the
way
and
is
chased
by
wolves
before
stumbling
upon
the
Beast
's
castle
,
where
he
meets
the
transformed
servants
Lumière
,
a
candelabra
,
Cogsworth
,
a
clock
,
Mrs.
Potts
,
a
teapot
,
and
her
son
Chip
,
a
teacup
.

The
Beast
imprisons
Maurice
,
but
Belle
is
led
back
to
the
castle
by
Maurice
's
horse
,
Phillipe
,
and
offers
to
take
her
father
's
place
,
to
which
the
Beast
agrees
.

While
Gaston
is
sulking
over
his
humiliation
in
the
tavern
after
a
failed
proposal
to
Belle
,
Maurice
tells
him
and
the
other
villagers
what
happened
but
they
think
he
has
gone
insane
.

At
the
castle
,
the
Beast
orders
Belle
to
dine
with
him
,
but
she
refuses
,
and
Lumiere
disobeys
his
order
not
to
let
her
eat
.

After
Cogsworth
gives
her
a
tour
of
the
castle
,
she
finds
the
rose
in
the
forbidden
West
Wing
and
the
Beast
angrily
chases
her
away
.

Frightened
,
she
tries
to
flee
,
but
she
and
Phillipe
are
attacked
by
wolves
.

After
the
Beast
rescues
her
,
she
nurses
his
wounds
,
and
he
begins
to
develop
feelings
for
her
.

The
Beast
grants
Belle
access
to
the
castle
library
,
which
impresses
Belle
and
they
become
friends
,
growing
closer
as
they
spend
more
time
together
.

Meanwhile
,
the
spurned
Gaston
pays
the
warden
of
the
town
's
insane
asylum
to
have
Maurice
committed
unless
Belle
agrees
to
Gaston
's
marriage
proposal
.

Back
at
the
castle
Belle
and
the
Beast
share
a
romantic
evening
together
.

Belle
tells
the
Beast
she
misses
her
father
,
and
he
lets
her
use
the
magic
mirror
to
see
him
.

When
Belle
sees
him
dying
in
the
woods
in
an
attempt
to
rescue
her
,
the
Beast
allows
her
to
leave
to
rescue
her
father
,
giving
her
the
mirror
to
remember
him
by
.

As
he
watches
her
leave
,
the
Beast
admits
to
Cogsworth
that
he
loves
Belle
.

Belle
finds
her
father
and
takes
him
home
.

Gaston
arrives
to
carry
out
his
plan
,
but
Belle
proves
Maurice
's
sanity
by
showing
them
the
Beast
with
the
magic
mirror
.

Realizing
Belle
has
feelings
for
the
Beast
,
Gaston
arouses
the
mob
's
anger
against
the
Beast
,
telling
them
that
the
Beast
is
a
man-eating
monster
that
must
be
killed
,
and
leads
them
to
the
castle
,
in
an
attempt
to
kill
his
animal-like
rival
so
to
have
Belle
for
himself
.

Gaston
confines
Belle
and
Maurice
in
the
basement
,
but
Chip
,
who
had
hidden
himself
in
Belle
's
baggage
,
uses
Maurice
's
wood-chopper
to
release
them
.

The
servants
scare
off
the
mob
,
but
Gaston
sneaks
away
to
hunt
down
the
Beast
.

The
Beast
is
initially
too
depressed
to
fight
back
,
but
he
regains
his
will
when
he
sees
Belle
returning
to
the
castle
with
Maurice
.

After
winning
a
heated
battle
,
the
Beast
spares
Gaston
's
life
,
giving
him
a
chance
to
leave
the
castle
and
is
about
to
reunite
with
Belle
.

However
,
Gaston
,
refusing
to
lose
,
stabs
the
Beast
from
behind
,
but
loses
his
balance
and
plummets
to
his
death
.

When
the
Beast
dies
,
Belle
professes
her
love
for
him
,
breaking
the
spell
as
the
rose
's
last
petal
falls
.

The
Beast
comes
back
to
life
,
his
human
form
restored
.

As
he
and
Belle
kiss
,
the
castle
and
its
inhabitants
return
to
their
previous
states
as
well
.

Belle
and
the
prince
dance
in
the
ballroom
with
her
father
and
the
humanized
servants
happily
watching
.

Cast

Cast
and

Production
Early
versions
Walt
Disney
sought
out
other
stories
to
turn
into
feature
films
after
the
success
of
Snow
White
and
the
Seven
Dwarfs
,
and
Beauty
and
the
Beast
was
among
the
stories
he
considered
.

Attempts
to
develop
the
Beauty
and
the
Beast
story
into
a
film
were
made
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
but
were
ultimately
given
up
because
it
"
proved
to
be
a
challenge
"
for
the
story
team
.

Peter
M.
Nichols
states
Disney
may
later
have
been
discouraged
by
Jean
Cocteau
having
already
done
his
version
.

Decades
later
,
after
the
success
of
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
in
0000
,
the
Disney
studio
resurrected
Beauty
and
the
Beast
as
a
project
for
the
satellite
animation
studio
it
had
set
up
in
London
,
England
to
work
on
Roger
Rabbit
.

Richard
Williams
,
who
had
directed
the
animated
portions
of
Roger
Rabbit
,
was
approached
to
direct
,
but
declined
in
favor
of
continuing
work
on
his
long-gestating
project
The
Thief
and
the
Cobbler
.

In
his
place
,
Williams
recommended
his
colleague
,
English
animation
director
Richard
Purdum
,
and
work
began
under
producer
Don
Hahn
on
a
non-musical
version
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
set
in
Victorian
France
.

At
the
behest
of
Disney
CEO
Michael
Eisner
,
Beauty
and
the
Beast
became
the
first
Disney
animated
film
to
use
a
screenwriter
.

This
was
an
unusual
production
move
for
an
animated
film
,
which
is
traditionally
developed
on
storyboard
s
rather
than
in
scripted
form
.

Linda
Woolverton
wrote
the
original
draft
of
the
story
before
storyboarding
began
,
and
worked
with
the
story
team
to
retool
and
develop
the
film
.

Script
rewrite
and
musicalization
Upon
seeing
the
initial
storyboard
reels
in
0000
,
Walt
Disney
Studios
chairman
Jeffrey
Katzenberg
ordered
that
the
film
be
scrapped
and
started
over
from
scratch
.

A
few
months
after
starting
anew
,
Purdam
resigned
as
director
.

The
studio
had
approached
Ron
Clements
and
John
Musker
to
direct
the
film
but
turned
down
the
offer
saying
they
were
"
tired
"
after
just
having
finished
directing
Disney
's
recent
success
The
Little
Mermaid
.

Disney
then
hired
first-time
feature
directors
Kirk
Wise
and
Gary
Trousdale
.

Wise
and
Trousdale
had
previously
directed
the
animated
sections
of
Cranium
Command
,
a
short
film
for
a
Disney
EPCOT
theme
park
attraction
.

In
addition
,
Katzenberg
asked
songwriters
Howard
Ashman
and
Alan
Menken
,
who
had
written
the
song
score
for
The
Little
Mermaid
to
turn
Beauty
and
the
Beast
into
a
Broadway-style
musical
film
in
the
same
vein
as
Mermaid
.

Ashman
,
who
at
the
time
had
learned
he
was
dying
of
complications
from
AIDS
,
had
been
working
with
Disney
on
a
pet
project
of
his
,
Aladdin
,
and
only
reluctantly
agreed
to
join
the
struggling
production
team
.

To
accommodate
Ashman
's
failing
health
,
pre-production
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
was
moved
from
London
to
the
Residence
Inn
in
Fishkill
,
New
York
,
close
to
Ashman
's
New
York
City
home
.

Here
,
Ashman
and
Menken
joined
Wise
,
Trousdale
,
Hahn
,
and
Woolverton
in
retooling
the
film
's
script
.

Since
the
original
story
had
only
two
major
characters
,
the
filmmakers
enhanced
them
,
added
new
characters
in
the
form
of
enchanted
household
items
who
"
add
warmth
and
comedy
to
a
gloomy
story
"
and
guide
the
audience
through
the
film
,
and
added
a
"
real
villain
"
in
the
form
of
Gaston
.

These
ideas
were
somewhat
similar
to
elements
of
the
0000
French
film
version
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
,
which
introduced
the
character
of
Avenant
,
an
oafish
suitor
somewhat
similar
to
Gaston
as
well
as
inanimate
objects
coming
to
life
in
the
Beast
's
castle
.

The
animated
objects
were
,
however
,
given
distinct
personalities
in
the
Disney
version
.

By
early
0000
,
Katzenberg
had
approved
the
revised
script
,
and
storyboarding
began
again
.

The
production
flew
story
artists
back
and
forth
between
California
and
New
York
for
storyboard
approvals
from
Ashman
,
though
the
team
was
not
told
the
reason
why
.

Animation
Production
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
had
to
be
completed
on
a
compressed
timeline
of
two
years
rather
than
four
because
of
the
loss
of
production
time
spent
developing
the
earlier
Purdam
version
of
the
film
.

Most
of
the
production
was
done
at
the
main
Feature
Animation
studio
,
housed
in
the
Air
Way
facility
in
Glendale
,
California
.

A
smaller
team
at
the
Disney-MGM
Studios
theme
park
in
Lake
Buena
Vista
,
Florida
assisted
the
California
team
on
several
scenes
,
particularly
the
"
Be
Our
Guest
"
number
.

Beauty
and
the
Beast
was
the
second
film
,
following
The
Rescuers
Down
Under
,
produced
using
CAPS
(
Computer
Animation
Production
System
)
,
a
digital
scanning
,
ink
,
paint
,
and
compositing
system
of
software
and
hardware
developed
for
Disney
by
Pixar
.

The
software
allowed
for
a
wider
range
of
colors
,
as
well
as
soft
shading
and
colored
line
effects
for
the
characters
,
techniques
lost
when
the
Disney
studio
abandoned
hand
inking
for
xerography
in
the
late
0000s
.

CAPS
also
allowed
the
production
crew
to
simulate
multiplane
effects
:
placing
characters
and/or
backgrounds
on
separate
layers
and
moving
them
towards/away
from
the
camera
on
the
Z-axis
to
give
the
illusion
of
depth
,
as
well
as
altering
the
focus
of
each
layer
.

In
addition
,
CAPS
allowed
easier
combination
of
hand-drawn
art
with
computer-generated
imagery
,
which
before
had
to
be
plotted
to
animation
cels
and
painted
traditionally
.

This
technique
was
put
to
significant
use
during
the
"
Beauty
and
the
Beast
"
waltz
sequence
,
in
which
Belle
and
Beast
dance
through
a
computer-generated
ballroom
as
the
camera
dollies
around
them
in
simulated
0D
space
.

The
filmmakers
had
originally
decided
against
the
use
of
computers
in
favor
of
traditional
animation
,
but
later
,
when
the
technology
had
improved
,
decided
it
could
be
used
for
the
one
scene
in
the
ballroom
.

The
success
of
the
ballroom
sequence
helped
convince
studio
executives
to
further
invest
in
computer
animation
.

Music
Ashman
and
Menken
wrote
the
Beauty
song
score
during
the
pre-production
process
in
Fishkill
,
the
opening
operetta
-
styled
"
Belle
"
being
their
first
composition
for
the
film
.

Other
songs
included
"
Be
Our
Guest
,
"
sung
(
in
its
original
version
)
to
Maurice
by
the
objects
when
he
becomes
the
first
visitor
to
eat
at
the
castle
in
a
decade
,
"
Gaston
,
"
a
solo
for
the
swaggering
villain
,
"
Human
Again
,
"
a
song
describing
Belle
and
Beast
's
growing
love
from
the
objects
'
perspective
,
the
love
ballad
"
Beauty
and
the
Beast
,
"
and
the
climactic
"
The
Mob
Song
.
"

As
story
and
song
development
came
to
a
close
,
full
production
began
in
Burbank
while
voice
and
song
recording
began
in
New
York
City
.

The
Beauty
songs
were
mostly
recorded
live
with
the
orchestra
and
the
voice
cast
performing
simultaneously
rather
than
overdub
bed
separately
,
in
order
to
give
the
songs
a
cast
album
-
like
"
energy
"
the
filmmakers
and
songwriters
desired
.

During
the
course
of
production
,
many
changes
were
made
to
the
structure
of
the
film
,
necessitating
the
replacement
and
re-purposing
of
songs
.

After
screening
a
mostly
animated
version
of
the
"
Be
Our
Guest
"
sequence
,
story
artist
Bruce
Woodside
suggested
that
the
objects
should
be
singing
the
song
to
Belle
rather
than
her
father
.

Wise
and
Trousdale
agreed
,
and
the
sequence
and
song
were
retooled
to
replace
Maurice
with
Belle
.
"

Human
Again
"
was
dropped
from
the
film
before
animation
began
,
as
its
lyrics
caused
story
problems
about
the
timeline
over
which
the
story
takes
place
.

This
required
Ashman
and
Menken
to
write
a
new
song
in
its
place
.
"

Something
There
,
"
in
which
Belle
and
Beast
sing
(
via
voiceover
)
of
their
growing
fondness
for
each
other
,
was
composed
late
in
production
and
inserted
into
the
script
in
place
of
"
Human
Again
.
"

Menken
would
later
revise
"
Human
Again
"
for
inclusion
in
the
0000
Broadway
stage
version
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
,
and
another
revised
version
of
the
song
was
added
to
the
film
itself
in
a
new
sequence
created
for
the
film
's
Special
Edition
re-release
in
0000
.

Ashman
died
of
AIDS-related
complications
on
March
00
,
0000
,
eight
months
prior
to
the
release
of
the
film
.

He
never
saw
the
finished
film
,
and
his
work
on
Aladdin
was
completed
by
another
lyricist
,
Tim
Rice
.

Before
Ashman
's
death
,
members
of
the
film
's
production
team
visited
him
after
the
film
's
well-received
first
screening
,
with
Don
Hahn
commenting
that
"
the
film
would
be
a
great
success
.

Who
'd
have
thought
it
?
"

,
to
which
Ashman
replied
with
"
I
would
.
"

A
tribute
to
the
lyricist
was
included
at
the
end
of
the
credits
crawl
:
"
To
our
friend
,
Howard
,
who
gave
a
mermaid
her
voice
,
and
a
beast
his
soul
.

We
will
be
forever
grateful
.

Howard
Ashman

A

"
theme
,
performed
by
Céline
Dion
and
Peabo

credits
,
was
released
as
a

The

became
an
international
pop
hit
,
reaching
the
Top

of
the

in
the
United

Musical
numbers
Release
and
re-releases
The
film
was
shown
at
the
New
York
Film
Festival
in
September
0000
.

Because
the
animation
was
only
about
00
%
complete
,
the
film
was
shown
as
a
"
work
in
progress
.
"

Storyboards
and
pencil
tests
were
used
in
place
of
the
remaining
00
%
.

In
addition
,
parts
of
the
film
that
were
finished
were
"
stepped
back
"
to
previous
versions
of
completion
.

The
"
work-in-progress
"
version
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
played
to
a
standing
ovation
from
the
film
festival
audience
.

The
completed
film
would
also
be
screened
out
of
competition
at
the
0000
Cannes
Film
Festival
.

The
finished
film
premiered
at
the
El
Capitan
Theatre
in
Hollywood
on
November
00
,
0000
,
and
went
into
wide
release
through
Walt
Disney
Pictures
on
November
00
.

Disney
initially
planned
a
re-release
of
the
film
to
be
released
theatrically
in
December
0000
in
an
attempt
of
counterprogramming
against
DreamWorks
'
The
Prince
of
Egypt
.

The
idea
to
restore
the
"
Human
Again
"
sequence
was
originally
for
this
re-issue
.

However
,
due
to
impending
competition
from
the
aforementioned
Prince
of
Egypt
as
well
as
The
Rugrats
Movie
,
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
City
and
Jack
Frost
as
well
as
Disney
's
own
holiday
release
schedule
being
quite
full
with
Enemy
of
the
State
,
A
Bug
's
Life
and
Mighty
Joe
Young
,
the
re-release
was
delayed
to
spring
0000
.

When
Disney
decided
to
bump
Doug
's
0st
Movie
from
direct-to-video
to
a
theatrical
release
,
that
film
took
the
re-release
's
date
,
delaying
it
to
the
holiday
season
.

Presumably
due
to
competition
,
like
the
year
before
,
and
Disney
's
own
efforts
to
promote
Toy
Story
0
,
this
release
date
was
also
canceled
.

In
0000
,
Beauty
and
the
Beast
was
added
to
the
United
States
National
Film
Registry
as
being
deemed
"
culturally
,
historically
,
or
aesthetically
significant
.
"

The
film
was
restored
and
remaster
ed
for
its
New
Year
's
Day
,
0000
re-release
in
IMAX
theatres
in
a
special
edition
edit
including
a
new
musical
sequence
.

For
this
version
of
the
film
,
much
of
the
animation
was
cleaned
up
,
a
new
sequence
set
to
the
deleted
song
"
Human
Again
"
was
inserted
into
the
film
's
second
act
,
and
a
new
digital
master

Reception
Upon
the
theatrical
release
of
the
finished
version
,
the
film
was
universally
acclaimed
by
critics
.

Roger
Ebert
gave
it
four
stars
out
of
four
and
saying
that
"
Beauty
and
the
Beast
reaches
back
to
an
older
and
healthier
Hollywood
tradition
in
which
the
best
writers
,
musicians
and
filmmakers
are
gathered
for
a
project
on
the
assumption
that
a
family
audience
deserves
great
entertainment
,
too
.
"

He
ranked
the
film
as
the
third
best
film
of
0000
.

James
Berardinelli
gave
the
film
a
four
out
of
four
stars
and
says
,
"
As
a
romance
,
Beauty
and
the
Beast
is
a
delightful
confection
,
creating
a
pair
of
memorable
,
three-dimensional
characters
and
giving
us
reason
to
root
for
their
union
.
"

Berardinelli
has
called
the
film
the
greatest
animated
film
of
all
time
and
has
ranked
it
No.
00
in
his
Top
000
Films
,
ahead
of
other
famous
films
like
No.
00
The
Wizard
of
Oz
,
No.
00
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird
,
and
No.
00
Lawrence
of
Arabia
.

The
film
received
mostly
positive
reviews
,
among
them
some
of
the
best
notices
the
studio
had
received
since
the
0000s
.

Rotten

aggregator
,
shows
Beauty
and
the

with

as
of

averaged
from

reviews
of
the

and
later

versions
.

The
use
of
computer
animation
,
particularly
in
the
"
Beauty
and
the
Beast
"
ballroom
sequence
,
was
singled
out
in
several
reviews
as
one
of
the
film
's
highlights
.

Smoodin
writes
in
his
book
Animating
Culture
that
the
studio
was
trying
to
make
up
for
earlier
gender
stereotypes
with
this
film
.

Smoodin
also
states
that
,
in
the
way
it
has
been
viewed
as
bringing
together
traditional
fairy
tales
and
feminism
as
well
as
computer
and
traditional
animation
,
the
film
's
"
greatness
could
be
proved
in
terms
of
technology
narrative
or
even
politics
"
.

Another
author
writes
that
Belle
"
becomes
a
sort
of
intellectual
less
by
actually
reading
books
,
it
seems
,
than
by
hanging
out
with
them
"
,
but
says
that
the
film
comes
closer
than
other
"
Disney-studio
"
films
to
"
accepting
challenges
of
the
kind
that
the
finest
Walt
Disney
features
met
"
.

David
Whitley
writes
in
The
Idea
of
Nature
in
Disney
Animation
that
Belle
is
different
from
earlier
Disney
heroines
in
that
she
is
mostly
free
from
the
burdens
of
domestic
housework
,
although
her
role
is
somewhat
undefined
in
the
same
way
that
"
contemporary
culture
now
requires
most
adolescent
girls
to
contribute
little
in
the
way
of
domestic
work
before
they
leave
home
and
have
to
take
on
the
fraught
,
multiple
responsibilities
of
the
working
mother
"
.

Whitley
also
notes
other
themes
and
modern
influences
,
such
as
the
film
's
critical
view
of
Gaston
's
chauvinism
and
attitude
towards
nature
,
the
cyborg-like
servants
,
and
the
father
's
role
as
an
inventor
rather
than
a
merchant
.

Betsy
Hearne
,
editor
of
The
Bulletin
of
the
Center
for
Children
's
Books
,
writes
that
the
film
belittles
the
original
story
's
moral
about
"
inner
beauty
"
,
as
well
as
the
heroine
herself
,
in
favor
of
a
more
brutish
struggle
;
"
In
fact
"
,
she
says
,
"
it
is
not
Beauty
's
lack
of
love
that
almost
kills
Disney
's
beast
,
but
a
rival
's
dagger
.
"

Stefan
Kanfer
writes
in
his
book
Serious
Business
that
in
this
film
"
the
tradition
of
the
musical
theater
was
fully
co-opted
"
,
such
as
in
the
casting
of
Broadway
performers
Angela
Lansbury
and
Jerry
Orbach
.

IGN
named
Beauty
and
the
Beast
as
the
greatest
animated
film
of
all
time
,
directly
ahead
of
WALL-E
.

Stage
musical
According
to
an
article
in
The
Houston
Chronicle
,
"
The
catalyst
for
Disney
's
braving
the
stage
was
an
article
by
New

Times
theater
critic
Frank
Rich
that
praised
Beauty
and
the
Beast
as
0000
's
best
musical
....
Theatre
Under
The
Stars
executive
director
Frank
Young
had
been
trying
to
get
Disney
interested
in
a
stage
version
of
Beauty
about
the
same
time
Eisner
and
Katzenberg
were
mulling
over
Rich
's
column
.

But
Young
could
n't
seem
to
get
in
touch
with
the
right
person
in
the
Disney
empire
.

Nothing
happened
till
the
Disney
execs
started
to
pursue
the
project
from

end

When
they
asked
George
Ives
,
the

on

West

,
which
Los
Angeles
theater
would
be
the
best
venue
for
launching

,
Ives
said
the

for
that
purpose
would
be

Not
long

,
Disney

Don
Frantz

Fermor
,
the
daughter
of
Lord
Pomfret
whose
estate
was
called
Easton
Neston
,
near

,
England
.

As

American
tribes
in
the
Ohio
Country

)
.

It

flown
during
that
reading
,
making
it
one

,
on

Hills
from
opera
singer
Lawrence
Tibbett
,
planning
to
stay
while
his

and

Charlie
Luciano
,
Bugsy
is
in
California
to
wrestle
control
of
betting
parlors
away
from
Los
Angeles
gangster
Jack
Dragna
.

Mickey
Cohen
robs
Dragna
's
office
one
day
,
and
is
confronted
by
Bugsy
,
who
decides
he
should
be
in
business
with
the
guy
who
committed
the

,
not
the

robbed
.

Cohen
is
put
in
charge
of

betting
casinos
;
Dragna
is
forced
to
admit
to
a
raging
Bugsy
that
he
stole
$
00,000
,
and
is
told
he
now
answers
to
Cohen
.

After
an
earlier
argument
about
Virginia
's
sexual
trysts
with
drummer
Gene
Krupa
and
a
variety
of
bull
fighters
,
Virginia
makes
a
romantic
move
on
Siegel
.

On
a
trip
to
Nevada
to
visit
a
gambling
joint
,
Bugsy
comes
up
with
the
idea
for
a
casino
in
the
desert
.

He
obtains
$
0
million
in
funding
from
his
longtime
friend
Meyer
Lansky
(
Ben
Kingsley
)
and
other
New
York
mobsters
.

Bugsy
puts
Virginia
in
charge
of
accounting
and
begins
construction
of
the
Flamingo
Las
Vegas
Hotel
Casino
in
Las
Vegas
,
Nevada
,
but
the
budget
soon
soars
to
$
0
million
due
to
his
extravagance
.

Bugsy
tries
everything
to
ensure
it
gets
completed
,
even
selling
his
share
of
the
casino
and
most
of
his
belongings
.

Bugsy
is
visited
in
Los
Angeles
by
former
associate
Harry
Greenberg
.

Harry
has
betrayed
his
old
associates
to
save
himself
.

Harry
has
also
run
out
of
money
,
from
a
combination
of
his
gambling
habits
,
and
being
extorted
by
the
prosecutors
who
want
his
testimony
.

Though
he
is
Harry
's
last
and
only
friend
,
Bugsy
has
no
choice
but
to
kill
Harry
.

Bugsy
is
arrested
for
Harry
's
murder
.

The
only
witness
is
a
cab
driver
who
dropped
off
Harry
in
front
of
Bugsy
's
Beverly
Hills
house
.

The
driver
is
escorted
to
the
train
station
by
Mickey
Cohen
.

Meyer
is
waiting
for
Bugsy
outside
the
jail
.

Meyer
has
a
satchel
of
money
that
he
gives
to
his
friend
.
"

Charlie
does
n't
have
to
know
about
it
,
"
he
tells
Bugsy
,
but
warns
"
I
ca
n't
protect
you
anymore
.
"

Upset
about
the
costs
,
the
fact
that
the
casino
is
a
failure
,
and
that
$
0
million
of
the
budget
is
unaccounted
for
,
Meyer
Lansky
asks
Bugsy
to
meet
him
in
Los
Angeles
.

Bugsy
discovers
that
Virginia
stole
the
money
,
but
tells
her
to
"
keep
it
and
save
it
for
a
rainy
day
"
.

He
then
calls
Lansky
and
tells
him
never
to
sell
his
share
of
the
casino
and
that
he
will
live
to
thank
him
someday
.

Later
that
night
,
Bugsy
is
killed
by
several
gunshots
.

Virginia
is
told
the
news
back
in
Las
Vegas
and
becomes
upset
,
rushing
out
of
the
casino
.

The
ending
text
before
the
credits
states
that
she
returned
the
missing
money
a
week
later
and
committed
suicide
at
some
point
after
that
.

also
states
that
by

the

and
being
murdered
that
night
alone
at

's

While
Siegel
did
close
the

,
his

History
Until
the
mid-00th
century
,
the
Lenni
Lenape
(
Delaware
)
tribes
hunted
and
inhabited
the
land
of
Lower
Saucon
Township
.

European
traders
first
appeared
in
the
area
prior
to
0000
,
and
the
Native
Americans
peacefully
traded
with
these
outsiders
,
although
some
minor
skirmishes
did
occur
.

William
Penn
was
granted
land
on
March
0
,
0000
,
by
King
Charles
II
to
repay
a
debt
owed
to
Penn
’s
father
.

The
land
grant
included
what
is
now
Lower
Saucon
Township
.

However
,
Penn
soon
realized
that
he
needed
to
purchase
the
land
from
the
Native
Americans
to
maintain
clear
ownership
.

Penn
advertised
throughout
Europe
,
offering
parcels
of
land
for
00
shillings
,
subject
to
a
rent
of
one
shilling
per
annum
forever
.

In
0000
,
Penn
’s
sons
expanded
their
land
holdings
to
include
most
of
the
Lehigh
Valley
through
the
“
Walking
Purchase
.

”
Although
the
Lenni
Lenape
did
not
think
this
was
a
legitimate
claim
,
they
eventually
moved
out
of
the
area
,
allowing
Europeans
to
settle
it
.

Sometime
before
0000
,
Nathaniel
Irish
established
a
farm
,
built
a
grist
and
saw
mill
,
and
opened
a
land
office
for
William
Penn.
.

He
is
considered
the
first
European
settler
in
Lower
Saucon
Township
.

His
land
later
became
known
as
Shimersville
.

Irish
was
the
first
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
area
,
and
the
first
“
King
’s
Highway
,
”
from
Philadelphia
to
the
Lehigh
Valley
,
built
in
0000
,
led
to
his
property
.

Lower
Saucon
Township
was
chartered
in
0000
,
when
it
was
still
a
part
of
Bucks
County
.

It
was
established
in
the
rich
farmland
along
the
Saucon
Creek
.

The
name
is
of
Native
American
origin
,
from
sakunk
,
meaning
“
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
.

”
The
township
also
included
South
Bethlehem
until
0000
and
Hellertown
until
0000
.

German
immigrants
,
convinced
by
Penn
’s
favorable
description
of
the
New
World
,
settled
Lower
Saucon
Township
in
large
numbers
,
beginning
in
the
0000s
.

Some
of
the
surnames
of
the
early
German
settlers
were
Boehm
,
Wagner
,
Appel
,
Riegel
,
Lerch
,
Laubach
,
Oberley
,
Heller
,
Shimer
,
and
Lutz
.

These
early
settlers
were
hardworking
,
and
their
farms
prospered
.

There
were
numerous
mills
built
to
provide
sawed
wood
,
flour
,
textiles
,
paper
,
and
gunpowder
.

Other
early
industry
included
lime
kilns
and
the
extracting
of
zinc
and
iron
ore
.

During
the
Revolutionary
War
,
many
German
farmers
enlisted
in
the
Continental
army
to
fight
the
British
.

At
a
time
when
the
army
’s
reserves
were
depleted
,
they
offered
to
sell
wheat
and
rye
on
credit
.

In
0000
,
soldiers
of
the
Continental
army
transporting
the
Liberty
Bell
to
Allentown
passed
through
Lower
Saucon
,
spending
a
night
in
Leithsville
.

The
Marquis
de
Lafayette
,
according
to
legend
,
stopped
at
Wagner
’s
Tavern
in
Hellertown
on
his
way
to
Bethlehem
during
the
war
.

The
first
church
,
Lower
Saucon
Church
,
was
established
in
0000
,
soon
after
the
early
settlers
had
arrived
.

It
was
built
by
a
German
Reformed
congregation
on
what
is
now
Easton
Road
.

There
were
00
schools
in
place
in
the
township
even
before
the
legislature
of
Pennsylvania
adopted
the
public
school
system
in
0000
.

These
schools
were
established
by
the
local
church
congregations
.

When
the
North
Penn
Railroad
,
connecting
Philadelphia
to
Bethlehem
,
was
completed
in
0000
,
this
line
provided
an
impetus
to
building
iron
smelters
in
Bingen
,
Hellertown
,
and
Iron
Hill
,
due
to
the
township
’s
wealth
of
iron
ore
and
limestone
.

The
railroad
brought
coal
to
this
industry
,
transported
pig
iron
to
markets
,
and
provided
transportation
for
the
township
’s
population
.

Lower
Saucon
Township
felt
the
influence
of
the
Bethlehem
Steel
Company
.

The
executives
purchased
farmland
in
the
township
to
build
large
estates
,
and
the
steel
company
became
the
largest
employer
in
the
area
.

When
it
ceased
manufacturing
in
0000
,
many
residents
of
Lower
Saucon
suffered
loss
of
employment
.

Today
,
farmland
continues
to
be
lost
to
housing
developments
at
a
startling
rate
.

The
township
still
possesses
beautiful
woods
,
streams
,
and
rolling
hills
,
but
care
must
be
taken
to
preserve
these
open
spaces
that
remain
.

County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the

.

The
population
was

History
Origins
of
Name
The
borough
is
named
for
the
Biblical
town
of
Nazareth
,
where
Jesus
Christ
resided
in
his
youth
.

The
names
of
other
places
in
the
Lehigh
Valley
area
of
Pennsylvania
are
similarly
inspired
,
including
Bethlehem
,
Emmaus
,
Egypt
,
and
Allentown
's
Jordan
Creek
.

William
Penn
bequeathed
this
land
to
his
daughter
,
Letitia
,
who
under
colonial
law
would
have
had
to
pay
a
single
red
rose
each
June
00
,
if
so
demanded
by
the
trustees
.

People
in
Nazareth
celebrate
this
every
year
on
June
00
and
00
by
various
organizations
selling
single
red
roses
throughout
the
town
.

Moravian
History
Nazareth
was
founded
in
0000
by
immigrants
from
Germany
of
the
Protestant
faith
.

Their
leader
was
George
Whitefield
.

Initially
,
Nazareth
was
specifically
Moravian
by
charter
.

Outside
faiths
were
not
allowed
to
purchase
property
within
Nazareth
,
a
basically
all
German
Protestant
community
.

Nazareth
remained
basically
all
German
derivative
in
population
until
0000
at
the
completion
of
connecting
superhighways
to
the
New
York
City
area
.

(
Interstate
routes
00
,

,

)
In
0000
a
small
group
of
the
Moravian
missionaries
had
begun
work
in
the
newly
settled
community
of
Savannah
,
Georgia
.

Their
intent
was
to
evangelize
the
native
American
tribes
and
minister
to
the
settlers
.

Governor
Oglethorpe
,
founder
of
Georgia
,
and
John
and
Charles
Wesley
,
founders
of
the
Methodist
Church
and
deeply
interested
in
Moravian
ideals
,
came
along
on
the
same
boat
.

The
Brethren
settled
along
the
Savannah
River
in
Georgia
.

Like
the
Quakers
,
the
Brethren
refused
to
take
part
in
the
war
with
the
Spanish
and
,
as
a
result
,
they
were
evicted
from
Georgia
in
0000
.

George
Whitefield
,
a
widely
known
itinerant
preacher
who
had
served
for
a
time
as
chaplain
of
Savannah
,
brought
the
group
of
evicted
Georgia
Brethren
north
to
Philadelphia
in
his
sloop
.

Whitefield
had
grandiose
plans
,
and
one
of
them
was
for
a
school
for
Negro
children
to
be
established
on
his
tract
of
called
the
Barony
of
Nazareth
.

He
invited
the
Brethren
who
accompanied
him
to
Philadelphia
to
settle
at
this
location
for
the
time
being
and
hired
them
to
build
his
school
.

By
the
end
of
June
,
0000
,
the
first
log
dwelling
was
erected
.

The
workers
struggled
,
the
weather
did
not
cooperate
,
and
winter
soon
arrived
.

They
quickly
erected
a
second
log
house
.

After
its
completion
,
word
came
that
Whitefield
had
returned
to
Pennsylvania
,
bristling
and
angered
by
theological
disputes
with
certain
Moravians
,
particularly
on
the
issue
of
predestination
.

In
no
uncertain
terms
he
ordered
the
Moravian
Brethren
off
his
land
at
once
.

While
evicted
from
the
Barony
,
Moravian
leaders
in
England
were
negotiating
to
buy
the
entire
Barony
.

When
Whitefield
's
business
manager
suddenly
died
,
Whitefield
discovered
that
his
finances
,
shaky
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
with
his
Nazareth
plan
.

He
was
forced
to
sell
the
whole
tract
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
it
officially
became
Moravian
property
.

Nazareth
was
originally
planned
as
a
central
English-speaking
church
village
.

But
in
October
0000
,
its
00
English
inhabitants
departed
for
Philadelphia
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Nazareth
tract
was
largely
in
the
hand
of
Captain
John
,
a
Lenape
chieftain
who
(
along
with
his
followers
)
stubbornly
refused
to
leave
,
even
though
they
no
longer
owned
the
land
.

In
December
0000
,
Count
Zinzendorf
made
a
settlement
with
Captain
John
,
and
his
tribe
moved
back
into
the
hinterland
.

A
letter
on
the
settlement
was
agreed
upon
,
and
is
available
here
:[

]
During
0000
,
the
still
unfinished
Whitefield
House
was
put
in
readiness
for
00
young
married
couples
who
were
to
arrive
from
Europe
.

On
the
second
day
of
the
new
year
,
0000
,
the
couples
went
overland
to
Nazareth
to
settle
in
the
nearly
completed
Whitefield
House
.

The
result
was
that
Nazareth
began
to
grow
rapidly
.

So
many
visitors
were
attracted
to
the
town
that
the
Rose
Inn
was
built
in
0000
on
an
additional
tract
to
the
north
.

Finally
,
in
0000
,
Nazareth
Hall
was
built
in
hopes
that
Count
Zinzendorf
would
return
from
Europe
and
settle
in
Nazareth
permanently
,
but
he
never
returned
to
the
U.S.
However
,
in
0000
Nazareth
Hall
became
the
central
boarding
school
for
sons
of
Moravian
parents
.

Later
it
attained
wide
fame
as
a
"
classical
academy
.
"

This
eventually
led
to
the
founding
,
in
0000
,
of
Moravian
College
and
Theological
Seminary
,
now
located
in
Bethlehem
.

The
Nazareth
Hall
Tract
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Pennsylvania
Dutch
settlements
Up
until
the
mid
0000s
,
a
large
part
of
the
native
population
was
of
German
origin
,
better
known
as
the
Pennsylvania
Dutch
.
"

Dutch
"
was
a
corruption
of
the
word
"
Deutsch
"
,
which
is
the
original
German
word
for
the
English
word
"
German
.
"

The
Pennsylvania
Dutch
were
spread
throughout
many
counties
of
southern
and
central
Pennsylvania
.

In
addition
to
Pennsylvania
Dutch
from
Germany
,
many
also
came
from
Switzerland
and
the
Alsace
,
which
is
now
part
of
France
.

Thus
Pennsylvania
Dutch
,
the
term
,
includes
residents
which
historically
lived
near
the
"
German
"
origin
Pennsylvania
Dutch
of
Germany
,
in
both
France
and
Switzerland
,
whose
borders
over
time
had
been
traded
around
to
be
included
in
one
country
and
then
another
,
and
the
Pennsylvania
Dutch
were
not
then
technically
JUST
from
Germany
,
although
they
did
share
common
bloodlines
and
ancestries
,
living
in
close
locale
.

Pennsylvania
Dutch
might
more
properly
include
one
area
of
European
origin
,
rather
than
one
specific
country
of
Europe
,
as
the
borders
were
given
to
vary
over
the
centuries
.

Religious
diversity
of
0000s
Nazareth
's
residents
'
religion
reflected
a
largely
German
background
in
evangelical
churches
of
fairly
large
sizes
for
such
a
small
town
,
divided
among
the
Moravian
,
Lutheran
,
Reformed
(
now
part
of
the
United
Church
of
Christ
)
,
and
Roman
Catholic
worship
centers
of
the
town
.

The
town
also
hosted
a
fairly
sizable
Italian
and
Polish
population
,
which
largely
attended
the
Catholic
Church
in
the
area
.

Strong
religious
partisanship
was
largely
a
reflection
of
the
seriousness
with
which
the
Pennsylvania
Dutch
took
their
faith
,
while
only
differing
in
seemingly
minor
points
from
each
other
,
at
least
compared
to
a
more
worldwide
view
of
religions
and
their
differences
.

Construction
boom
During
a
great
immigration
to
the
eastern
Pennsylvania
counties
of
the
late
0000s
from
New
Jersey
and
New
York
,
the
population
expanded
significantly
.

Developers
from
the
New
Jersey
area
were
responding
to
tighter
controls
and
regulations
on
new
construction
in
the
state
of
New
Jersey
by
moving
their
enterprises
to
Pennsylvania
.

This
new
expansion
and
housing
boom
was
enabled
by
the
local
completion
of
the
interstate
system
of
highways
,
first
begun
by
former
U.S.
President
Dwight
Eisenhower
in
the
0000s
.

In
the
Nazareth
area
,
this
was
caused
by
the
completion
of
the
nearby
Pennsylvania
Route
00
,
which
ran
north
and
south
,
thereby
connecting
Interstate
00
,
U.S
Route
00
,
and
Interstate
00
(
all
of
which
ran
east-west
)
,
and
the
completion
of
the
Interstate
00
southern
Lehigh
Valley
corridor
high
speed
interstate
,
which
connected
the
Lehigh
Valley
to
New
Jersey
and
New
York
to
the
east
,
and
Harrisburg
and
Pittsburgh
to
the
west
.

,
and
very
short

Nazareth
's
topography
can
best
be
described
as
hilly
,
as
the
town
itself
sits
atop
a
local
outcropping
underground
of
one
of
the
richest
veins
of
limestone
in

Industry
Martin
Guitar
Nazareth
is
the
global
headquarters
for
C.F.
Martin
&
Company
,
which
manufactures
Martin
guitars
.

Martin
guitars
are
handmade
instruments
that
once
were
made
by
artisans
who
apprenticed
for
years
to
learn
their
trade
.

Now
,
Martin
Guitars
are
made
largely
on
an
assembly
line
monitored
and
assisted
by
workers
,
computers
,
and
lasers
.

Assembly
lines
at
Martin
were
instituted
to
lower
costs
,
improve
speed
of
production
,
and
compete
with
foreign
manufacturers
,
without
which
efforts
it
is
said
that
the
company
would
have
ceased
to
survive
.

Cement
manufacturing
In
the
0000s
,
at
least
three
large
cement
companies
surrounded
the
Nazareth
borough
area
,
Essroc
(
formally
Coplay
Cement
)
,
Hercules
Cement
,
and
Penn-Dixie
Cement
Companies
.

The
Coplay
plant
on
the
southside
has
undergone
company
ownership
changes
through
the
years
(
and
was
also
known
as
the
Nazareth
Cement
Company
,
among
other
names
)
.

Hundreds
of
union
laborers
of
the
United
Gypsum
,
Lime
and
Cement
Unions
worked
in
each
plant
around
the
town
from
the
early
0000s
.

Every
summer
,
lucky
college
students
were
hired
for
well
paying
labor
jobs
as
summer
help
.

Stories
of
the
hard
pre-union
days
at
the
cement
plants
are
replete
with
the
description
of
twelve
hour
days
for
survival
wages
,
poor
working
and
health
conditions
,
and
many
dangerous
incidents
and
accidents
causing
loss
of
life
and
or
limb
without
medical
plans
or
benefits
to
survivors
.

Since
the
0000s
,
however
,
the
automation
of
the
plants
and
eventual
reselling
of
them
to
foreign
firms
has
brought
about
the
loss
of
most
of
the
high-paying
union
cement
jobs
,
presenting
a
blow
to
the
Lehigh
Valley
economy
.

The
impact
on
the
local
economy
of
these
lost
cement
jobs
was
intensified
by
the
ultimate
closing
of
neighboring
Bethlehem
Steel
in
0000
.

In
the
case
of
Bethlehem
Steel
,
it
was
not
automation
and
modernization
that
downsized
the
workforce
,
but
failure
to
modernize
the
mills
,
overloaded
management
,
and
a
laissez-faire
management
attitude
about
foreign
competition
and
cheap
foreign
steel
production
.

History
In

met
at
the
Northampton
Hotel
,
and
signed
a
petition
declaring

held
,
with
William
H.
Thomas
becoming
the

,
an

.

Located
between
the
larger
boroughs
of
Catasauqua
in
Lehigh
County
,
and
Northampton
in
Northampton
County
,
North
Catasauqua
quickly
grew
as
businesses
and
residents
came
into
the
new
borough
.

Eventually
a
police
department
was
formed
along
with
the
Charotin
Fire
Department
in
0000
.

A
new
combined
firehouse
and
municipal
building
was
built
in

,
fire-fighting
equipment
was
housed

personal
friends
and

school
building
housed
grade

the
municipal
building
site
in
0000
with
the
building
of
a
new
combined

History
Northampton
was
once
a
global
center
for
the
manufacturing
of
cement
.

The
Atlas
Portland
Cement
Company
was
based
there
,
until
it
was
closed
in
0000
,
due
largely
to
foreign
competition
.

Northampton
was
created
from
the
villages
of
Siegfried
,
Newport
and
Stemton
,
which
together
were
formed
into
an
alliance
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Atlas
petitioned
county
courts
to
change
the
alliance
into
a
borough
,
reportedly
because
the
change
would
make
it
easier
for
the
company
to
send
and
receive
mail
.

The
Atlas
Portland
Cement
Company
plant
closed
in
0000
,
but

residents
many
of
them
former
Atlas
employees
or
their
descendants
—
still
identify

Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Palmer
Township
is
located
in
the
Lehigh
Valley
region
of
the
state
.

The
Township
is
home
to
Easton
Area
High
School
,
a
large
public
high
school
known
for
its
rivalry
with
Phillipsburg
High
School
.

The
population
of
Palmer
Township
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
first
known
inhabitants
of
the
area
now
known
as
Palmer
Township
were
the
Lenape
Native
Americans
in
the
00th
century
.

German
Moravian
settlers
built
on
land
in
the
Palmer
area
in
0000
.

At
the
time
,
the
area
was
part
of
Bucks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
which
by
the
mid-00th
century
also
included
land
now
called
Northampton
County
and
Lehigh
County
.

Northampton
County
separated
from
Bucks
County
on
March
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
Forks
Township
,
which
then
also
consisted
of
what
is
now
Palmer
Township
,
was
incorporated
in
0000
with
a
total
population
of
about
00
inhabitants
.

On
May
0
,
0000
,
Palmer
Township
was
formed
out
of
the
land
area
of
Forks
Township
south
and
west
of
the
Bushkill
Creek
;
the
original
population
of
the
township
was
about
0,000
people
.

The
township
was
named
after
George
Palmer
,
the
Pennsylvania
Surveyor
General
who
surveyed
the
original
township
lines
.

At
the
time
that
it
was
incorporated
,
the
township
was
about
and
included
what
are
now
known
as
the
boroughs
of
Tatamy
(
which
became
incorporated
in
0000
)
,
West
Easton
(
incorporated
in
0000
)
,
Stockertown
(
incorporated
in
0000
)
and
Wilson
(
incorporated
in
0000
)
.

The
main
activity
of
Palmer
Township
during
its
earliest
years
was
providing
access
roads
from
the
neighboring
city
Easton
to
surrounding
communities
,
including
Bethlehem
,
Freemansburg
and
Nazareth
.

During
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
,
the
township
included
many
stone
houses
near
water
,
for
purposes
of
power
and
water
supply
,
and
roads
,
to
allow
for
trade
.

Among
them
were
the
Seipsville
Hotel
,
which
was
built
by
the
settler
Peter
Seip
in
0000
at
the
crossroads
of
roads
leading
from
Easton
,
Nazareth
and
Hecktown
.

Seip
had
purchased
land
along
the
west
side
of
Old
Nazareth
Road
;
the
area
later
became
known
as
Seipsville
in
honor
of
Seip
.

The
Seipsville
Hotel
was
the
first
public
house
between
Easton
and
Nazareth
,
and
became
a
popular
stagecoach
stop
for
travelers
passing
through
the
Lehigh
Valley
.

In
0000
,
the
building
(
now
known
as
the
Seipsville
Inn
)
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
due
to
the
significance
of
its
architecture
and
engineering
.

The
township
started
to
experience
major
growth
after
World
War
I
and
World
War
II
as
part
of
a
general
trend
of
population
movement
from
nearby
cities
to
the
suburbs
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
subdivision
activity
along
inter-city
trolley
lines
led
to
a
building
spurt
in
Palmer
Township
,
which
doubled
the
population
within
00
years
.

As
a
result
,
the
township
became
seen
as
a
desirable
place
to
live
for
people
who
worked
in
other
areas
of
the
Lehigh
Valley
.

The
population
saw
further
growth
in
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
due
to
the
expansion
of
water
lines
and
the
development
of
low-income
housing
.

Economy
A
lack
of
water
during
the
early
days
of
Palmer
Township
limited
the
amount
of
farming
that
could
be
done
,
and
industry
was
limited
mainly
to
the
Bushkill
Creek
waterways
,
where
some
form
of
power
was
available
.

Residents
had
to
get
water
from
hand
dug
wells
because
it
was
too
difficult
to
find
a
source
of
water
close
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
.

Other
industries
began
to
arise
in
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
,
including
some
iron
ore
excavation
in
the
Fairview
Knolls
area
and
cement
industry
near
the
Tatamy
area
;
also
at
this
time
,
the
Taylor
Wharton
and
Treadwell
Engineering
were
established
in
Palmer
Township
to
manufacture
equipment
mainly
for
railroad
use
.

Gradually
,
farming
techniques
grew
more
and
more
in
the
area
,
until
by
the
late
0000s
almost
00
percent
of
the
township
was
in
farm
lands
.

The
township
saw
new
businesses
in
the
mid
0000s
,
including
ITT
in
0000
and
Acopian
Corp.
,
in

Infrastructure
When
Palmer
's
major
roadway
system
first
started
to
develop
in
the
00th
century
,
it
was
dictated
largely
by
the
trails
leading
from
Easton
to
outlying
communities
.

William
Penn
Highway
,
the
first
road
built
in
Palmer
in
around

and
the
Newburg

communities
.

Greenwood
Avenue
,
which
runs
between
Freemansburg
Avenue
and
William
Penn
Highway
,
was
opened
in
the
0000s
.

At
the
time
,
township
Supervisor
President
H.
Robert
Daws
said
,
"
The
opening
of
this
north-south
artery
in
the
center
of
the
township
benefits
not
only
the
township
,
but
the

Portland
is
a
borough
in

region
of
the
state

,
of

and
of

History
Portland
was
settled
because
of
the
logging
trade
and
what
buildings
were
here
in
the
early
00th
century
came
as
a
result
of
this
industry
.

It
served
to
increase
at
least
one
business
–
that
of
the
taverns
and
hotels
.

that
the
Hibblertown
Hotel
(

house
on
State

)
,
the
Dill
’s
Tavern
(

tavern
,
was
located
on

,
now

)
and
the
What
Cheer
Inn
(
present
Duckloe
Showroom
at
the
corner
of
Delaware
Avenue
and
Main
Street
)
all
prospered
because
of
loggers
.

The
railroad
was
a
vital
force
in
the
development
of
Portland
.

It
changed
the
mode
of
transporting
goods
,
and
attracted
many
new
residents
.

As
a
result
of
increased
population
,
the
business
community
expanded
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
village
.

By
the
time
of
the
incorporation
there
were
three
general
stores
,
a
hardware
store
,
a
drug
store
,
four
confectionary
shops
,
two
millinery
shops
,
and
jewelry
store
.

,
the

Enterprise
.

Raymond
,
gave
the
people
on
both
sides
of

all
the
news
.

Coe
Finch
took
over
the
paper
in
the
0000s
and
continued
until

became
editor
in

.

The
financial
center
