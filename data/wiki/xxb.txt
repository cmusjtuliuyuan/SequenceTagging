Fredericktown
is
a
village
in
Knox
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Long
before
white
settlers
entered
the
area
,
Adena
and
Hopewell
Indians
inhabited
the
area
of
Fredericktown
.

Early
settlers
found
three
mounds
and
earthworks
located
on
nearby
hilltops
.

While
the
Raleigh
Mound
and
Stackhouse
Mound
and
Works
are
preserved
today
,
the
third
mound
,
located
by
what
is
presently
the
Baptist
Church
,
was
demolished
.

Both
preserved
mounds
were
most
likely
ceremonial
structures
and
they
are
oriented
towards
the
Sun
's
movements
.

When
settlers
arrived
,
the
sites
were
abandoned
with
few
other
traces
of
the
Natives
who
lived
there
.

There
were
a
few
scattered
Native
Americans
living
nearby
along
what
was
then
the
periphery
of
Indian
Lands
established
by
the
Greenville
Treaty
Line
.

The
first
white
settler
was
John
Kerr
who
in
0000
bought
and
planned
the
town
,
and
built
a
mill
on
the
North
Branch
of
the
Kokosing
River
.

Growth
was
sluggish
until
the
Sandusky
,
Mansfield
,
and
Newark
Railroad
came
through
the
village
in
0000
.

A
grain
elevator
,
foundry
,
and
other
small
trading
businesses
were
built
,
helping
to
establish
Fredericktown
more
firmly
as
the
local
business
center
than
the
nearby
crossroad
settlements
of
Batemantown
,
Waterford
,
and
Ankeneytown
.

Around
World
War
II
a
small
airplane
paneling
factory
was
built
and
later
reverted
to
furniture
manufacturing
.

In
the
last
half
of
the
00th
century
,
a
few
light
manufacturing
operations
and
the
largest
privately
owned
general
construction
contractor
in
Ohio
,
Kokosing

were
established
.

The
National
FFA
Organization
Official
Dress
Jacket
has
its
origins
in

.

In
0000
FFA
members
from
the
local
chapter
arrived
at
the
national
convention
in
blue
corduroy
jackets
with
the
FFA
emblem
on
the
back
.

That
same
year
national
delegates
voted
to
adopt
it
as
the
official
dress
.

Today
more
than
00,000
are
manufactured
yearly
for
FFA
members
.

History
Fairport
Harbor
's
location
at
the
mouth
of
the
Grand
River
made
it
an
ideal
place
for
a
settlement
.

After
being
claimed
as
part
of
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
by
the
Connecticut
Land
Company
in
0000
–
0000
,
the
town
of
Grandon
was
platted
there
on
May
00
,
0000
.

When
the
town
incorporated
in
0000
,
the
name
was
changed
to
"
Fairport
.
"

The
current
name
was
adopted
in
0000
.

After
receiving
federal
sponsorship
,
the
village
's
port
flourished
,
and
an
influx
of
Finns
,
Hungarians
,
and
Slovaks
arrived
there
.

The
port
also
imported
iron
ore
for
use
at
area
steel
mills
.

The
port
continues
operation
at
a
more
limited
capacity
.

Later
in
the
village
's
history
,
the
Diamond
Alkali
Company
operated
from
0000
to
0000
.

In
recent
years
Fairport
Harbor
has
hosted
the
Lake
County
Perch
Fest
and
opened
the
Finnish
Heritage
Museum
.

On
January
00
,
0000
,
an
overpressurized
Dominion
East
Ohio
natural
gas
pipeline
caused
devices
in
at
least
least
00
dwellings
to
explode
,
causing
the
structures
to
burn
and
leading
to
a
mass
evacuation
.

The
excess
pressure
has
been
attributed
to
ice
present
in
a
sensor
line
causing
a
false
reading
in
a
pressure
regulator
.

The
backup
regulator
for
the
pipeline
also
failed
.

While
no
injuries
were
reported
in
the
community
,
the
cost
of
damage
was
placed
at
approximately
$
0.0
million
.

Kirtland
is
a
city
in
Lake
County
,
in
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Kirtland
is
famous
for
being
the
early
headquarters
of
the
Latter
Day
Saint
movement
.

History
Origins
of
Kirtland
In
prehistory
the
Kirtland
area
was
covered
by
ocean
water
(
000
million
years
ago
)
.

The
bedrock
is
a
silt
shale
of
the
Ohio
shale
group
named
Chagrin
Shale
.

Above
the
Chagrin
Shale
is
Cleveland
Shale
,
a
Devonian
formation
which
is
an
important
source
of
local
fossil
s.
The
Cleveland
Shale
is
overlaid
by
Bedford
Shale
.

Berea
Sandstone
is
the
next
layer
and
an
important
local
building
material
,
which
has
been
used
to
construct
the
Kirtland
Temple
and
other
historic
buildings
.

The
caprock
is
Sharon
Conglomerate
,
a
sandstone
with
embedded
quartz
pebbles
.

About
00,000
years
ago
glaciers
covered
all
of
northern
Ohio
,
so
the
landscape
of
the
region
is
dominated
by
the
effects
of
glaciation
.

After
the
founding
of
the
United
States
,
northern
Ohio
was
designated
as
the
Western
Reserve
and
was
sold
to
the
Connecticut
Land
Company
.

The
area
was
first
surveyed
by
Moses
Cleaveland
and
his
party
in
0000
.

Kirtland
is
named
for
Turhand
Kirtland
,
a
principal
of
the
Connecticut
Land
Company
and
judge
in
Trumbull
County
,
the
first
political
entity
in
Ohio
that
included
Kirtland
township
.

Kirtland
,
a
veteran
of
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
demonstrated
"
both
breadth
of
vision
and
integrity
"
in
his
fair
dealings
with
the
local
Native
Americans
.

He
was
known
for
his
bravery
,
resourcefulness
,
and
passion
for
justice
.

Dr.
Jared
Potter
Kirtland
was
the
son
of
the
former
;
he
helped
to
found
a
medical
college
in
nearby
Willoughby
,
Ohio
,
and
he
compiled
the
first
ornithology
of
Ohio
.

The
bird
Kirtland
's
Warbler
is
named
for
Jared
Kirtland
.

This
rare
species
has
been
documented
in
the
city
during
migration
,
but
it
does
not
nest
in
Ohio
.

Being
less
well
suited
to
agriculture
,
the
densely
forested
,
clay
soiled
,
high
,
hilly
,
land
of
Kirtland
was
settled
later
than
surrounding
townships
:
Mentor
in
0000
,
and
Chester
in
0000
.

Kirtland
's
first
European
settlers
were
the
John
Moore
family
,
soon
followed
by
the
Crary
family
who
came
to
Kirtland
in
0000
.

In
0000
Christopher
Crary
wrote
a
memoir
of
his
Kirtland
life
,
which
provided
a
great
deal
of
material
for
Anne
B.
Prusha
's
0000
history
of
Kirtland
.

Headquarters
of
the
Latter
Day
Saint
movement
From
0000
to
0000
Kirtland
was
the
headquarters
for
the
Latter
Day
Saint
movement
.

Joseph
Smith
moved
the
church
to
Kirtland
in
0000
,
shortly
after
its
formal
organization
in
April
0000
in
Palmyra
,
New
York
.

Latter
Day
Saints
built
their
first
temple
there
,
a
historic
landmark
that
is
now
owned
and
operated
by
the
Community
of
Christ
,
a
group
descended
from
the
church
founded
by
Smith
.

The
temple
was
built
with
a
degree
of
opulence
,
considering
the
underdeveloped
nature
of
the
area
and
the
poverty
of
most
early
church
members
.

Many
attending
the
Kirtland
Temple
dedication
in
0000
claimed
to
see
multiple
heavenly
visions
and
appearances
of
heavenly
beings
,
including
deity
.

For
this
and
other
reasons
,
Kirtland
remains
a
place
of
importance
to
those
of
all
Latter
Day
Saint
denominations
.

Many
sections
from
the
Doctrine
and
Covenants
,
considered
modern
revelations
and
canonical
by
most
denominations
within
the
Latter
Day
Saint
movement
,
originated
in
Kirtland
during
the
0000s
.

Ownership
of
the
Kirtland
Temple
was
in
a
confused
state
and
disputed
for
a
number
of
years
,
but
eventually
it
was
declared
by
court
action
to
be
the
property
of
the
Reorganized
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter
Day
Saints
(
now
Community
of
Christ
)
.

Today
,
besides
giving
tours
,
the
Community
of
Christ
church
allows
others
to
use
the
temple
for
special
meetings
.

0000
to
present
After
the
majority
of
the
Latter
Day
Saints
departed
Kirtland
in
0000-00
,
and
during
the
latter
part
of
the
00th
century
,
Kirtland
’s
population
diminished
and
life
was
typical
of
that
of
the
region
.

Crary
recalls
the
last
rattlesnakes
being
killed
on
Gildersleeve
Mountain
in
the
0000s
.

During
this
period
most
of
the
wooded
areas
near
Kirtland
were
cleared
for
agriculture
,
with
corn
and
apples
being
the
predominant
crops
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
Kirtland
School
(
now
Kirtland
Elementary
)
was
built
to
consolidate
0
school
houses
.

One
of
the
old
school
houses
can
still
be
found
at
the
corner
of
Baldwin
and
Booth
Roads
in
Kirtland
Hills
.

Kirtland
saw
few
changes
until
after
World
War
II
when
several
residential
subdivisions
were
built
.

In
0000
a
high
school
was
built
and
in
0000
,
Gildersleeve
Elementary
was
built
along
Chardon
Rd.
(
US-0
)
.

In
0000
a
middle
school
was
completed
for
grades
0
–
0
.

In
0000
the
citizens
of
Kirtland
voted
in
a
special
election
to
incorporate
the
township
.

James
Naughton
was
the
first
mayor
of
the
village

,
and
Gerard
Pitts
(
James

)
are
senior
students
of
the
Welton
Academy
,
an
elite
prep
school
,
whose
ethos
is
defined
by
the
headmaster
Gale
Nolan
(
Norman
Lloyd
)
as
"
tradition
,
honor
,
discipline
and
excellence
"
.

The
teaching
methods
of
their
new
English
teacher
,
John
Keating
(
Robin
Williams
)
,
are
unorthodox
by
Welton
standards
,
whistling
the
0000
Overture
and
taking
them
out
of
the
classroom
to
focus
on
the
idea
of
carpe
diem
.

He
tells
the
students
that
they
may
call
him
"
O
Captain
!
My
Captain
!

,
"
in
reference
to
a
Walt
Whitman
poem
,
if
they
feel
daring
.

In
another
class
,
Keating
has
Neil
read
the
introduction
to
their
poetry
textbook
,
prescribing
a
mathematical
formula
to
rate
the
quality
of
poetry
which
Keating
finds
ridiculous
,
and
he
instructs
his
pupils
to
rip
the
introduction
out
of
their
books
,
to
the
amazement
of
one
of
his
colleagues
.

Later
he
has
the
students
stand
on
his
desk
in
order
to
look
at
the
world
in
a
different
way
.

The
boys
discover
that
Keating
was
a
former
student
at
Welton
and
decide
to
secretly
revive
the
school
literary
club
,
the
"
Dead
Poets
Society
"
,
to
which
Keating
had
belonged
,
meeting
in
a
cave
off
the
school
grounds
.

Due
to
self-consciousness
,
Todd
fails
to
complete
a
writing
assignment
and
Keating
takes
him
through
an
exercise
in
self-expression
,
realizing
the
potential
he
possesses
.

Charlie
publishes
an
unauthorized
article
in
the
school
newspaper
,
asserting
that
girls
should
be
admitted
to
Welton
.

At
the
resulting
school
inquiry
,
he
offers
a
phone
call
from
God
in
support
,
incurring
the
headmaster
's
wrath
.

After
being
lectured
by
Headmaster
Nolan
about
his
teaching
methods
,
Keating
tells
the
boys
to
"
be
wise
,
not
stupid
"
about
protesting
against
the
system
.

Knox
meets
and
falls
in
love
with
a
girl
named
Chris
,
using
his
new-found
love
of
poetry
to
woo
her
.

He
presents
one
of
these
poems
in
class
,
and
is
applauded
by
Keating
for
writing
a
heartfelt
poem
on
love
.

Knox
travels
to
Chris
'
public
school
and
recites
his
poem
to
her
,
later
convincing
her
to
go
to
a
play
with
him
.

Neil
wants
to
be
an
actor
but
knows
his
father
(
Kurtwood
Smith
)
will
disapprove
.

Without
his
father
's
knowledge
,
he
auditions
for
the
role
of
Puck
in
a
production
of
A
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
.

His
father
finds
out
and
orders
Neil
to
withdraw
.

Neil
asks
Keating
for
advice
and
is
advised
to
talk
to
his
father
and
make
him
understand
how
he
feels
,
but
Neil
can
not
muster
the
courage
to
do
so
.

Instead
he
goes
against
his
father
's
wishes
.

His
father
shows
up
at
the
end
of
the
play
,
furious
.

He
takes
Neil
home
and
tells
him
that
he
intends
to
enroll
him
in
a
military
school
to
prepare
him
for
Harvard
University
and
a
career
in
medicine
.

Unable
to
cope
with
the
future
that
awaits
him
or
to
make
his
father
understand
his
feelings
,
Neil
commits
suicide
.

At
the
request
of
Neil
's
parents
,
the
headmaster
launches
an
investigation
.

Cameron
meets
the
school
governors
and
board
of
regents
.

Later
,
confronted
by
Charlie
,
Cameron
admits
that
he
squealed
on
them
and
made
Keating
the
scapegoat
,
and
urges
the
rest
of
them
to
let
Keating
take
the
fall
.

Charlie
punches
Cameron
and
is
later
expelled
.

Todd
is
called
to
Nolan
's
office
,
where
his
parents
are
waiting
.

Nolan
forces
Todd
to
admit
to
being
a
member
of
the
Dead
Poets
Society
,
and
makes
him
sign
a
document
blaming
Keating
for
abusing
his
authority
,
inciting
the
boys
to
restart
the
club
,
and
encouraging
Neil
to
flout
his
father
's
wishes
.

Todd
sees
the
other
boys
'
signatures
already
on
the
document
,
and
is
threatened
by
his
father
to
sign
it
.

Keating
is
subsequently
fired
.

The
boys
return
to
English
class
,
now
being
taught
by
Nolan
,
who
instructs
the
boys
to
read
the
introductory
essay
only
to
find
that
they
had
all
ripped
it
out
.

Keating
enters
the
room
to
retrieve
a
few
belongings
.

Todd
reveals
that
the
boys
were
intimidated
into
signing
the
denunciation
.

Nolan
orders
Todd
to
be
quiet
and
demands
that
Keating
leave
.

As
Keating
is
about
to
exit
,
Todd
for
the
first
time
breaks
his
reserve
,
calls
out
"
O
Captain
!

and
stands
on
his
desk
.

Nolan
warns
Todd
to
sit
down
or
face
expulsion
.

Much
of
the
class
,
including
Knox
,
Meeks
,
and
Pitts
,
climb
onto
their
desks
and
look
to
Keating
,
ignoring
Nolan
's
orders
until
he
gives
up
.

Keating
leaves
visibly
touched
.

He
criticized
Williams
for
spoiling
an
otherwise
creditable
dramatic
performance
by
occasionally
veering
into
his

comedian
's
persona
,
and
lamented
that
for
movie
set
in
the
0000s
there
was
no
mention
of
the
Beat
Generation
writers
.

Additionally
,
Ebert
described
the
movie
as
an
often
poorly
constructed
"
collection
of
pious
platitudes
[
...
]
The
movie
pays
lip
service
to
qualities

values
that
,
on
the
evidence
of
the
screenplay
itself
,
it
is
cheerfully
willing

abandon

Willoughby
is
a
city
in
Lake
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

It
is
a
suburb
of
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Willoughby
's
first
permanent
settler
was
David
Abbott
in
0000
,
pre-dating
Ohio
's
bid
for
statehood
by
five
years
.

Abbott
and
his
family
had
close
relations
to
the
local
tribe
of
Erie
Indians
along
the
banks
of
the
river
the
Indians
called
the
"
Sha-ga-rin
"
or
Clear
Water
.

This
river
was
later
called
the
Chagrin
River
,
though
the
derivation
of
the
name
remains
in
dispute
.

In
0000
,
the
village
was
permanently
named
"
Willoughby
"
in
honor
of
Dr.
Westel
Willoughby
,
Jr.
,
a
public
health
official
that
the
founders
of
the
Medical
College
,
which
was
based
in
the
city
,
hoped
to
attract
to
the
area
.

This
medical
college
would
later
merge
with
Western
Reserve
Academy
in
Hudson
,
OH
to
eventually
become
Western
Reserve
University
,
the
predecessor
to
Cleveland
's
Case
Western
Reserve
University
.

Many
historical
buildings

this
period
survive
to
this
date
,
affording
the
downtown
Willoughby
area
some
outstanding
specimens
of

War
I
,
the

weapons
plant
producing
lewisite
.

Over

,
Willoughby
sent
citizens
into
every
major
U.S.
military
conflict
.

Several
memorials
and
historical
relics
are

Point
Park
,
the
center
of
downtown
Willoughby
,
to
honor
those
that

Ironton
is
a
city
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Ohio
and
the
county
seat
of
Lawrence
County
.

The
municipality
is
located
in
southern
Ohio
along
the
Ohio
River
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Ironton
is
part
of
the
Huntington-Ashland
,
WV-KY-OH
,
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
(
MSA
)
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
MSA
had
a
population
of
000,000
.

New
definitions
from
February
00
,
0000
placed
the
population
at
000,000
.

History
Ironton
was
founded
in
0000
by
John
Campbell
,
who
was
a
prominent
pig
iron
manufacturer
in
the
area
.

Interested
in
expanding
his
foundry
business
,
and
due
to
the
area
's
rich
iron-ore
content
(
particularly
in
the
hills
to
the
north
)
,
he
became
interested
in
the
lands
surrounding
what
would
later
become
the
city
of
Ironton
.

The
location
of
Ironton
was
chosen
for
its
position
along
the
Ohio
River
,
which
would
allow
for
transport
of
the
much-needed
commodity
,
iron-ore
,
and
the
slope
of
the
land
itself
,
which
facilitated
movement
of
the
raw
material
to
the
local
blast
furnaces
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
Ironton
was
one
of
the
foremost
producers
of
iron
in
the
world
.

England
,
France
,
and
Russia
all
purchased
iron
for
warships
from
here
due
to
the
quality
;
iron
produced
in
Ironton
and
surrounding
areas
was
used
for
the
USS
Monitor
,
the
United
States
'
first
ironclad
ship
.

There
were
more
than
ninety
furnaces
in
operation
at
the
peak
of
production
in
the
late
00th
century
.

The
immense
wealth
that
was
created
from
the
bustling
pig-iron
industry
led
to
the
construction
of
many
opulent
residences
.

With
much
wealth
pouring
into
the
city
from
the
iron
industry
,
new
industries
opened
that
included
soap
and
nail
production
.

The
Detroit
,
Toledo
and
Ironton
Railroad
,
which
stretched
through
two
states
,
helped
fuel
Henry
Ford
's
plants
in
Michigan
.

The
city
had
a
street
railway
,
the
Ironton
Petersburg
Street
Railway
,
and
four
daily
newspapers
and
a
few
foreign-language
publications
.

Ironton
was
also
known
for
its
lax
attitude
towards
sin
and
vice
.

It
was
home
to
a
racetrack
,
numerous
saloons
,
and
brothel
s.
Numerous
chapels
offered
"
quick
and
quiet
"
marriages
.

The
downfall
of
Ironton
came
as
the
market
for
iron
changed
.

The
quality
of
the
iron
that
had
once
made
Ironton
one
of
the
leading
producers
of
pig
iron
was
no
longer
considered
as
desirable
.

All
of
the
easily
accessible
iron
(
close
to
the
surface
)
had
been
mined
by
0000
,
and
the
continued
production
costs
began
to
outweigh
the
benefit
.

Also
,
the
nation
was
making
the
transition
from
a
demand
for
iron
to
steel
.

After
a
nationwide
economic
recession
in
the
late
00th
century
,
Ironton
was
no
longer
growing
.

The
Great
Depression
of
the
late
0000s
and
two
major
floods
(
0000
,
0000
)
devastated
the
city
to
the
point
that
most
if
not
all
the
city
's
industries
had
closed
down
for
good
.

As
the
iron
industries
closed
,
Ironton
had
little
with
which
to
replace
them
.

A
labor-oriented
town
,
Ironton
managed
to
keep
alive
by
trying
to
attract
heavy
industry
to
the
region
.

Companies
like
Allied
Signal
and
Alpha
Portland
Cement
did
build
in
town
,
but
even
so
the
boom
days
were
now
over
.

The
continued
dependency
on
labor
industries
has
severely
hurt
the
region
as
a
whole
,
and
Ironton
even
more
so
.

By
0000
,
both
Alpha
Portland
Cement
and
Allied
Signal
were
gone
,
and
Ironton
had
shrunk
by
almost
00
%
.

Ironton
has
been
credited
as
being
part
of
the
Underground
Railroad
that
helped
runaway
slaves
flee
the
South
.

Both
the
founder
of
the
city
and
other
city
notables
helped
hide
slaves
in
their
homes
.

Ironton
's
military
heritage
During
the
American
Civil
War
,
local
military
regiment
s
were
mustered
,
quartered
,
and
trained
at
Camp
Ironton
,
a
military
post
located
at
the
county
fairgrounds
.

Among
them
was
the
00st
Ohio
Infantry
,
which
was
organized
at
Camp
Ironton
on
August
00
,

History
Indigenous
peoples
lived
along
the
river
valleys
for
thousands
of
years
before
Europe
an
contact
.

From
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
,
000
BC
to
000
AD
,
people
of
the
Hopewell
culture
transformed
the
area
of
Newark
.

They
built
many
earthen
mounds
and
enclosures
,
creating
the
single
largest
earthwork
complex
in
the
Ohio
River
Valley
.

The
Newark
Earthworks
,
designated
a
National
Historic
Landmark
,
have
been
preserved
to
document
and
interpret
the
area
's
significant
ancient
history
.

The
earthworks
cover
several
square
miles
.

The
Observatory
Mound
,
Observatory
Circle
,
and
the
interconnected
Octagon
earthworks
span
nearly
in
length
.

The
Octagon
alone
is
large
enough
to
contain
four
Roman
Coliseums
.

The
Great
Pyramid
of
Giza
in
Egypt
would
fit
precisely
inside
Observatory
Circle
.

The
even
larger
-
diameter
Newark
Great
Circle
is
the
largest
circular
earthwork
in
the
Americas
.

The
-
high
walls
surround
a
-
deep
moat
.

At
the
entrance
,
the
walls
and
moat
are
of
greater
and
more
impressive
dimensions
.

In
addition
,
the
remains
of
a
road
leading
south
from
the
Octagon
have
been
documented
and
explored
.

It
was
first
surveyed
in
the
00th
century
,
when
its
walls
were
more
apparent
.

Called
the
Great
Hopewell
Road
,
it
may
extend
to
the
Hopewell
complex
at
Chillicothe
,
Ohio
.

It
was
surveyed
at
least
six
miles
(
00
km
)
south
of
the
Octagon
,
and
can
be
seen
on
photographs
and
with
LiDAR
(
Light
Detection
and
Ranging
)
sensing
technology
south
of
that
.

Contemporary
archaeogeodesy
and
archaeoastronomy
researchers
have
demonstrated
that
the
Hopewell
and
other
prehistoric
culture
s
had
advanced
scientific
understandings
which
they
used
to
create
their
earthworks
for
astronomical
observations
,
markings
and
celebrations
.

Researchers
analyzed
the
placements
,
alignments
,
dimensions
,
and
site-to-site
interrelationships
of
the
Hopewell
earthworks
to
understand
what
had
been
done
.

Today
,
the
Ohio
Historical
Society
preserves
the
Great
Circle
Earthworks
in
a
public
park
near
downtown
Newark
,
called
Mound
Builders
Park
(
or
the
Newark
Earthworks
)
located
at
00
Cooper
Ave
,
Newark
,
Ohio
.

The
area
of
the
Octagon
Earthworks
had
been
leased
to
a
country
club
,
but
new
arrangements
in
0000
provide
for
more
public
access
to
it
.

Later
American
Indian
tribes
inhabiting
the
area
at
the
time
of
European
contact
were
distant
descendants
of
the
earlier
peoples
.

After
exploration
by
traders
and
trappers
in
earlier
centuries
,
the
first
European-American
settlers
arrived
in
0000
,
led
by
Gen.
William
C.
Schenck
.

He
named
the
new
village
after
his
New
Jersey
hometown
.

Later
public
improvements
led
to
growth
in
the
town
,
as
it
was
linked
to
major
transportation
and
trade
networks
.

On
July
0
,
0000
,
Governor
's
Clinton
of
New
York
and
Morrow
of
Ohio

the
first
shovelfuls
of
dirt
for
the
Ohio
and
Erie
Canal
project
,
at
the
Licking
Summit
near
Newark
,
Ohio

Plot
While
walking
in
his
cornfield
,
novice
farmer
Ray
Kinsella
hears
a
voice
that
whispers
,
"
If
you
build
it
,
he
will
come
"
,
and
sees
a
baseball
diamond
.

His
wife
,
Annie
,
is
skeptical
,
but
she
allows
him
to
plow
under
his
corn
to
build
the
field
.

Nothing
happens
,
and
Ray
soon
faces
financial
ruin
.

Ray
and
Annie
discuss
replanting
the
corn
,
but
their
daughter
,
Karin
,
sees
a
man
on
the
ballfield
.

Ray
discovers
that
he
is
Shoeless
Joe
Jackson
,
a
dead
baseball
player
idolized
by
Ray
's
father
.

Thrilled
to
be
able
to
play
baseball
again
,
Joe
asks
to
bring
others
to
play
on
the
field
.

He
later
returns
from
the
cornfield
with
the
seven
other
players
banned
in
the
0000
Black
Sox
scandal
.

Ray
's
brother-in-law
,
Mark
,
can
not
see
the
baseball
players
,
and
warns
Ray
that
he
will
go
bankrupt
unless
he
replants
his
crops
.

While
in
the
field
,
Ray
hears
the
voice
again
,
this
time
urging
him
to
"
ease
his
pain
.
"

After
attending
a
PTA
meeting
involving
a
resolution
to
ban
books
by
author
and
activist-turned
recluse
Terrence
Mann
,
Ray
decides
the
voice
is
referring
to
Mann
.

Ray
finds
a
magazine
interview
about
Mann
's
childhood
dream
of
playing
for
the
Brooklyn
Dodgers
and
his
heartbreak
when
the
team
moved
to
Los
Angeles
,
and
convinces
Annie
that
he
should
seek
out
the
author
after
they
both
dream
about
Ray
and
Terrence
attending
a
baseball
game
.

Mann
denies
making
the
statement
in
the
magazine
,
but
Ray
persuades
him
to
attend
a
baseball
game
at
Fenway
Park
.

Ray
hears
the
voice
again
,
which
urges
him
to
"
go
the
distance
.
"

The
scoreboard
shows
statistics
for
a
player
named
Archibald
"
Moonlight
"
Graham
,
who
played
one
game
for
the
New
York
Giants
in
0000
,
but
never
had
a
turn
at
bat
.

Mann
eventually
admits
to
sharing
the
vision
,
and
they
travel
to
Chisholm
,
Minnesota
where
they
learn
that
Graham
became
a
doctor
,
but
died
00
years
earlier
.

During
a
late
night
walk
,
Ray
realizes
that
he
is
in
0000
,
the
year
of
Graham
's
death
;
he
finds
Graham
who
confesses
to
him
that
although
he
regrets
never
getting
to
bat
,
he
would
have
regretted
not
being
a
doctor
even
more
.

He
declines
Ray
's
invitation
to
fulfill
his
dream
.

While
driving
back
to
Iowa
,
Ray
picks
up
a
young
hitchhiker
who
introduces
himself
as
Archie
Graham
.

While
Archie
sleeps
,
Ray
reveals
that
at
age
00
he
refused
to
play
catch
with
his
father
after
reading
one
of
Terrence
's
books
.

He
also
says
that
at
age
00
,
after
an
argument
with
his
father
about
the
criminality
of
the
elder
's
hero
"
Shoeless
"
Joe
Jackson
,
Ray
left
home
and
never
saw
his
father
again
.

At
the
farm
,
enough
players
have
arrived
to
field
two
teams
,
and
Archie
finally
gets
to
bat
.

The
next
morning
Mark
implores
Ray
to
sell
the
farm
.

Karin
says
that
they
wo
n't
need
to
because
people
will
pay
to
watch
the
ball
games
.

Terrence
agrees
that
"
people
will
come
"
to
relive
their
childhood
innocence
,
and
Ray
refuses
to
sell
.

Frustrated
,
Mark
scuffles
with
Ray
,
accidentally
knocking
Karin
off
the
top
of
the
bleachers
.

Archie
runs
to
help
and
,
stepping
off
the
field
,
becomes
the
old
"
Doc
"
Graham
.

After
he
saves
Karin
from
choking
,
Ray
realizes
that
Graham
can
not
return
to
the
field
as
a
young
man
.

After
reassuring
Ray
that
his
true
calling
was
medicine
,
the
players
shake
his
hand
and
he
leaves
.

Suddenly
able
to
see
the
players
,
Mark
urges
Ray
not
to
sell
the
farm
.

After
the
game
,
Joe
invites
Terrence
to
enter
the
cornfield
.

Terrence
accepts
the
offer
and
disappears
into
the
cornfield
,
but
Ray
is
angry
at
not
being
invited
.

Shoeless
Joe
rebukes
his
desire
for
a
reward
,
then
reminds
him
why
he
sacrificed
so
much
,
saying
"
If
you
build
it
,
he
will
come
"
,
and
glances
toward
home
plate
.

The
catcher
removes
his
mask
and
Ray
recognizes
his
father
as
a
young
man
.

Ray
introduces
his
father
to
Annie
and
Karin
.

As
his
father
heads
toward
the
cornfield
,
Ray
asks
his
"
Dad
"
to
play
catch
.

As
they
begin
to
play
,
hundreds
of
cars
can
be
seen
approaching
the
field
,
fulfilling
Karin
and
Terrence
's
prophecy
that
people
will
come
to
watch
baseball
.

Phil

read
Shoeless

in

,
and
liked
the
book
so
much
he
brought
it
to
producers
Lawrence

Lawrence
suggested
an

even
became

but
the

frequently
turned
it
down
as
they
felt
it

.

At
first
Kevin
Costner
was
taken
off
of
consideration
,
as
Robinson
and
the
producers
did
not
think
he
would
want
to
follow
Bull
Durham
with
another
baseball
movie
.

But
Costner
ended
up
reading
the
script
,
and
got
interested
in
the
project
,
saying
he
felt
was
"
this
generation
's
It
's
a
Wonderful
Life
"
.

Costner
added
to
Robinson
that
he
would
help
him
in
production
,
given
Robinson
's
directing
debut
In
the
Mood
was
a
commercial
failure
.

Filming
begun
on
May

,

.

Locations
Except
for
a
few
location
shots
in
Boston
,
notably
Fenway
Park
,
much
of
the
film
was
shot
in
Dubuque
County
,
Iowa
,
and
Jo
Daviess
County
,
Illinois
.

The
home
(
at
the
time
a
private
residence
)
and
field
were
on
adjoining
farms
near
Dyersville
,
Iowa
.

For
the
final
scene
,
Dyersville
was
blacked
out
as
part
of
a
community
event
that
also
involved
commuters
driving
to
the
field
.

The
drivers
in
the
final
shot
were
instructed
to
switch
between
their
high
beams
and
low
beams
to
allow
for
the
illusion
of
movement
.

The
"
Field
"
was
maintained
by
the
land
's
original
owner
,
Don
Lansing
,
as
a
tourist
destination
.

He
did
not
charge
for
admission
or
parking
,
and
derived
revenue
solely
from
the
souvenir
shop
.

Approximately
00,000
people
visited
annually
.

In
July
0000
,
the
farm
containing
the
"
Field
"
was
listed
as
for
sale
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
the
site
was
sold
to
a
company
called
Go
The
Distance
Baseball
for
an
undisclosed
fee
,
believed
to
be
in
the
region
of
$

Historical
connections
The
character
played
by
Burt
Lancaster
and
Frank
Whaley
,
Archibald
"
Moonlight
"
Graham
,
is
based
on
the
baseball
player
of
the
same
name
.

The
character
is
largely
true
to
life
,
excepting
a
few
factual
liberties
taken
for
artistic
reasons
.

The
real
Graham
's
lone
major
league
game
occurred
in
June
0000
,
rather
than
the
final

special
points
out
that
the
facts
about
Doc
Graham
,
mentioned
by

were
taken
from

The
highest
point
in

,

.

History
The
name

means
"
beautiful
spring
"
in
French
,
and
is
purported
to
refer
to
several
springs
in
the
area
.

Blue
Jacket
's
Town
Around
0000
,
the
Shawnee
war
leader
Blue
Jacket
(
Weyapiersenwah
)
built
a
settlement
here
,
known
as
Blue
Jacket
's
Town
.

Blue
Jacket
and
his
band
had
previously
occupied
a
village
along
the
Scioto
River
,
but
with
the
coming
of
the
American
Revolutionary
War
to
the
Ohio
Country
,
Blue
Jacket
and
other
American
Indians
who
took
up
arms
against
the
American
revolutionaries
relocated
in
order
to
be
closer
to
their
British
allies
at
Detroit
.

Blue
Jacket
's
Town
was
destroyed
in
Logan
's
Raid
,
conducted
by
Kentucky
militia
in
0000
at
the
outset
of
the
Northwest
Indian
War
.

The
expedition
was
led
by
Benjamin
Logan
,
namesake
of
Logan
County
.

Blue
Jacket
and
his
followers
relocated
further
northwest
to
the
Maumee
River
.

Beginning
in
the
0000s
,
American
Revolutionary
War
veterans
and
others
from
Virginia
and
elsewhere
began
settling
in
the
area
of
Blue
Jacket
's
Town
.

Bellefontaine
is
on
or
near
the
edge
of
the
Virginia
Military
District
,
and
the
Treaty
of
Greenville
delineating
lands
to
be
held
by
Americans
from
those
to
be
held
by
natives
was
poorly
administered
in
the
area
.

Railroads
Bellefontaine
was
plat
ted
in
0000
and
incorporated
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
Mad
River
&
Lake
Erie
Railroad
built
the
first
railroad
in
Bellefontaine
.

This
began
Bellefontaine
's
reputation
as
a
railroading
town
.

This
reputation
was
cemented
in
the
0000s
,
when
the
Cleveland
,
Cincinnati
,
Chicago
and
St.
Louis
Railroad
(
also
called
the
Big
Four
Railroad
)
built
a
main
terminal
in
the
city
.

This
terminal
also
boasted
the
largest
roundhouse
between
New
York
and
St.
Louis
.

Though
railroading
hit
hard
times
in
the
late
00th
century
,
and
the
Big
Four
terminal
ceased
operations
in
0000
,
Bellefontaine
remains
a
landmark
on
America
's
railways
.

The
city
is
at
the
junction
of
CSX
lines
going
to
Cleveland
,
Indianapolis
,
and
Dayton
.

Automotive
transportation
In
0000
,
Bellefontaine
became
the
location
of
the
first
concrete
street
in
America
.

George
Bartholomew
invented
a
process
for
paving
using
Portland
cement
,
which
until
then
had
been
used
in
stone
construction
.

A
small
section
of
Main
Street
,
on
the
west
side
of
the
Logan
County
Courthouse
,
was
the
first
to
be
paved
using
that
process
.

When
that
proved
successful
,
Court
Avenue
,
which
runs
along
the
south
side
of
the
courthouse
,
was
then
paved
.

While
Main
Street
is
now
paved
with
asphalt
,
Court
Avenue
has
retained
its
original
concrete
pavement
for
over
000
years
.

At
its
centennial
,
the
street
was
closed
and
a
statue
of
Bartholomew
placed
at
its
Main
Street
end
,
although
since
then
one
lane
has
been
reopened
for
eastbound
traffic
.

In
0000
,
Honda
began
manufacturing
motorcycles
in
the
Columbus
suburb
of
Marysville
,
Ohio
.

Since
that
time
,
Honda
's
operations
in
the
Bellefontaine
area
have
greatly
expanded
,
and
Bellefontaine
is
now
centrally
located
to
Honda
operations
in
Marysville
,
East
Liberty
,
Russells
Point
,
Anna
,
and
Troy
,
Ohio
.

It
follows
,
then
,
that
Honda
is
presently
Bellefontaine
's
largest
employer
.

Today
,
Bellefontaine
is
centered
at
the
intersection
of
U.S.
Route
00
with
State
Routes
00
and
000
.

U.S.
Route
00
,
a
freeway
that
has
interchanges
with
US
00
and
SR
000
,
skirts
the
northern
edge
of
the
city
.

Campbell
Hill
To
European
settlers
,
Campbell
Hill
was
first
known
as
Hogue
's
Hill
,
perhaps
a
misspelling
of
the
name
of
the
person
who
first
deeded
the
land
in
0000
,
Solomon
Rogue
.

In
0000
,
the
land
was
sold
to
Charles
D.
Campbell
,
in
whose
name
Campbell
Hill
is
now
known
.

Campbell
sold
the
hill
and
surrounding
land
to
August
Wagner
,
who
was
the
original
brewer
of
Augustiner
and
Gambrinus
beers
.

(
These
brands
are
now
the
trademarks
of
the
Gambrinus
Company
of
San
Antonio
,
Texas
,
though
the
company
has
stopped
production
of
these
beers
.
)

In
0000
,
the
family
of
August
Wagner
deeded
Campbell
Hill
and
the
surrounding
00.0
acres
to
the
U.S.
government
.

The
government
then
stationed
the
000th
Aircraft
Control
and
Warning
Squadron
on
the
hill
in
0000
.

This
military
unit
was
responsible
for
monitoring
for
possible
aerospace
attacks
from
the
Soviet
Union
during
the
Cold
War
.

The
000th
AC&WS
and
similar
military
units
were
eventually
superseded
by
the
North
American
Aerospace
Defense
Command
(
or
NORAD
)
,
and
the
base
in
Bellefontaine
was
closed
in
0000
.

The
Ohio
Hi-Point
Vocational-Technical
District
opened
a
school
atop
the
hill
in
0000
.

The
school
is
now
known
as
the
Ohio
Hi-Point
Career
Center
.

far
south
to

Lakes
region
,
however
does
experience
more
snow
than
surrounding
areas
due
to
the

,
leads
his
acting
troop
on
a
railroad
tour
of
the
U.S.
hinterland
.

His
troop
has
been
in
the
railroad
hub
Bellefontaine
before
,

he
pompously
refers

'
dear
old
Bellefontaine
'
,
to
which
he
and
his
fellow
players
(
"
martyrs
to
their
art
"
)
are
so
glad
to
return
.

They
have
however
the
habit
of
skipping
town
without
paying
their
boarding
bill
.

Presumably
it
was
Holland
Theatre
at
which
they
put
on
their
play
.

The
movie
is
set
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
,
just
as
the
first
motor
cars
arrived
in

;
one
scene

History
The
village
is
often
said
to
have
had
its
beginnings
as
early
as
0000
,
because
land
which
was
settled
by
pioneer
Jacob
Shupe
,
about
a
mile
north
of
the
original
village
site
,
was
eventually
(
at

much

included
into
the
Amherst
city-limits
.

However
,
the
actual
original
village
plot

not
encompass
Shupe
's
site
(
although
Shupe
's
pioneering
efforts
within
the
township
,
including
his
building
a
grist-mill
and
distillery
,
certainly
added
to
the
area
's
desirability
for
later
pioneers
to
settle
here

astronauts
,
who
was

Slayton
was

,
NASA
's
lunar

insisted
on
having

Apollo
astronauts
who
walked
on
the
Moon
Twelve
men
have
walked
on
the
Moon
–
all
American
–
eight
of
whom
are
still
alive
.

All
of
the
landings
took
place
between
July
0000
and
December
0000
as
part
of
the
Apollo
program
.

Regarding
"
the
last
man
to
walk
on
the
Moon
"
,
Schmitt
is
the
last
person
to
arrive
(
as
Cernan
got
out
of
the
Apollo
Lunar
Module
first
)
,
but
Cernan
is
the
last
person
to
leave
(
after
final
EVA
(
extra-vehicular
activity
)
,
Schmitt
went
inside
the
module
first
)
.

Duke
was
the
youngest
,
at
age
00
(
+0
mo
)
;
Shepard
was
the
oldest
,
at
age
00
(
+0

)
.

James
A.
Lovell
,
John
W.
Young
and
Eugene
Cernan
are
the
only
three
astronauts
to
fly
more
than
one
lunar
mission
(
two
each
)
.

Of
these
three
,
only
Lovell
did
not
walk
on
the
lunar
surface
.

Lovell
and
Fred
Haise
were
prevented
from
walking
on
the
Moon
by
the
malfunction
on
Apollo
00
that
resulted
in
the
mission
being
aborted
.

Haise
was
scheduled
to
walk
on
the
Moon
as
commander
of
Apollo
00
prior
to
that
mission
’s
cancellation
on
September

,
0000
.

Joe
Engle
had
also
trained
to
explore
the
Moon
with
Cernan
as
the
backup
crew
for
Apollo
00
,
but
Engle
was
later
replaced
by
geologist
Harrison
Schmitt
when
the
primary
crew
for
Apollo
00
was
selected
.

Schmitt
had
been
crewed
with
Dick
Gordon
in
anticipation
for
Apollo
00
.

When
Apollo
00
was
canceled
,
Schmitt
bumped
Engle
,
leaving
Gordon
as
the
last
Apollo
astronaut
who
had
trained
extensively
for
lunar
exploration
without
ever
getting
a
chance
to
fly
a
lunar
landing
.

Apollo
astronauts
who
flew
to
the
Moon
without
landing
Twelve
more
people
have
been
within
a
few
hundred
kilometers
of
the
Moon
.

On
each
of
the
missions
listed
above
one
astronaut
orbited
the
Moon
while
the
other
two
landed
.

In
addition
,
the
Apollo
0
,
Apollo

had
a
three-person
crew
and
closely
encountered
the
Moon
,
entering
orbit
in
the
case
of
the
former
two
missions
,
while
Apollo

only
passed
around
it
.

John
Young
and
Eugene
Cernan
both
flew
to
the
Moon
twice
,
each
setting
foot
on
it
as
part
of
their

journey
,
while
Jim

is
the
only
human
to
have
flown

Avon
Lake
is
a
city
in
Lorain
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the

census

History
From
000
to
000
million
years
ago
,
Avon
Lake
,
like
many
current
places
in
Ohio
,
was
part
of
the
Devonian
System
.

More
than
0
million
years
ago
,
what
is
now
Ohio
was
part
of
an
ocean
,
while
what
is
now
Pennsylvania
was
a
bunch
of
mountains
.

The
creatures
that
lived
here
were
the
dunkleosteus
,
the
trilobite
,
the
anomalocaris
(
a
predator
of
the
trilobite
)
,
and
others
.

00,000
to
00,000
years
ago
,
the
ground
of
Avon
Lake
was
made
of
Wisconsinan
ground
moraine
.

The
first
of
our
own
subspecies
settled
into
what
is
now
Avon
Lake
in
the
0000
's
.

Today
we
know
the
place
as
"
Avon
Lake
"
,
but
the
natives
who
lived
here
knew
of
it
as
part
of
a
place
called
"
Xeuma
"
.

These
people
included
the
Wyandot
,
Ottawa
,
and
Erie
(
name
meaning
"
cat
"
and
the
name
itself
shortened
from
"
Erielhonan
"
,
name
meaning
"
long-tail
"
)
,
whom
the
lake
is
named
after
.

Some
of
these
people
lived
in
wigwams
and
some
lived
in
simple
stone
dwellings
.

What
is
now
Avon
Lake
was
once
a
part
of
France
.

The
French
,
in
0000
,
were
chased
out
by
the
British
,
but
then
in
ten
years
later
,
the
British
were
forced
off
of
the
land
by
the
colonists
.

Besides
the
many
battles
with
the
natives
for
the
land
,
the
heritage
of
its
current
residents
includes
three
other
wars
.

During
the
Revolutionary
War
,
there
was
a
direct
trail
from
the
East
to
the
West
that
crossed
the
lake
shore
through
this
place
,
most
of
the
trail
being
where
Lorain
Road
is
today
.

The
trail
was
used
more
by
the
English
than
by
the
colonists
.

Avon
Lake
was
later
first
settled
by
Americans
of
European
descent
in
the
year
0000
(
a
year
that
this
place
was
very
important
)
,
and
was
part
of
Avon
Township
,
and
also
part
of
Cuyahoga
County
.

Then
in
0000
,
it
became
part
of
Lorain
County
.

Then
in
0000
,
this
part
of
Avon
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
Township
of
Avon
to
form
the
Township
of
Avon
Lake
.

And
finally
,
in
0000
,
this
place
was
granted
the
status
of
a
city
.

Elyria
is
a
city
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Ohio
and
the
county
seat
of
Lorain
County
.

The
municipality
is
located
in
northeastern
Ohio
at
the
forks
of
the
Black
River
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
had
a
population
of
00,000
.

The
city
is
named
for
its
founder
,
Heman
Ely
.

The
city
is
home
to
Lorain
County
Community
College
.

History
Elyria
was
founded
in
0000
by
Heman
Ely
,
who
built
a
log
house
,
dam
,
gristmill
,
and
sawmill
on
the
site
.

Ely
began
to
build
more
houses
to
accommodate
immigrating
settlers
.

By
the
time
Ely
died
in
0000
,
Elyria
had
0
churches
,
0
grocery
stores
,
0
flour
mills
,
a
newspaper
,
and
a
population
of
more
than
0,000
.

Early
postal
service
from
Cleveland
was
provided
by
rider
Artemis
Beebe
,
who
held
the
first
contract
to
deliver
mail
across
the
Black
River
.

As
the
0000s
arrived
,
Elyria
was
a
small
town
of
about
0,000
.

In
0000
,
Elyria
Memorial
Hospital
was
built
and
has
since
evolved
into
an
award-winning
regional
healthcare
system
.

In
August
0000
,
at
the
peak
of
Elyria
's
population
,
Midway
Mall
was
opened
and
changed
the
face
of
the
local
economy
as
local
businesses
either
moved
into
the
mall
or
closed
down
.

In
the
August
0000
,
interracial
tensions
between
blacks
and
whites
erupted
in
a
riot
that
resulted
in
broad
vandalism
and
burnt
buildings
and
shops
particularly
in
the
southern
and
western
portions
of
the
town
,
finally
brought
under
control
by
State
Guard
troops
.

Meanwhile
,
0
major
car
plant
closings
in
the
area
lead
to
economic
stagnation
and
joblessness
in
the
0000s
and
00s
that
affected
communities
throughout
the
region
,
later
referred
to
as
"
the
rustbelt
.
"

A
minor
and
only
temporary
revival
of
Elyria
in
the
0000s
saw
the
addition
of
some
new
roads
and
housing
in
Elyria
,
now
serving
more
as
a
residential
"
bedroom
community
"
for
Cleveland
as
new
industries
are
being
attracted
in

Corn
Festival
.

The

Committee
for
the
City
of
North
Ridgeville
was
formed
in
0000
to

first
festival
ran
0
hours
and

booths
around
the
North
Ridgeville
Middle

the
bicentennial
,
the
festival
was
held
in

sweet
corn
grower
in
North
Ridgeville
,
for
all
that
he
did
for
the
youth

Oberlin
is
a
city
in
Lorain
County
,
Ohio
,
to
the
south
and
west
of
Cleveland
.

Oberlin
is
the
home
of
Oberlin
College
,
a
liberal
arts
college
and
music
conservatory
with
approximately
0,000
students
.

The
town
is
the
birthplace
of
the
Anti-Saloon
League
and
the
modern
aluminum
refining
process
that
made
the
metal
economic
for
industrial
use
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Oberlin
was
founded
in
0000
by
two
Presbyterian
ministers
,
John
Jay
Shipherd
and
Philo
P.
Stewart
.

The
pair
had
become
friends
while
spending
the
summer
of
0000
together
in
nearby
Elyria
and
discovered
a
shared
dissatisfaction
with
what
they
saw
as
the
lack
of
strong
Christian
morals
among
the
settlers
of
the
American
West
.

Their
proposed
solution
was
to
create
a
religious
community
that
would
more
closely
adhere
to
Biblical
commandments
,
along
with
a
school
for
training
Christian
missionaries
who
would
eventually
spread
throughout
the
American
frontier
.

The
two
decided
to
name
their
community
after
Jean-Frédéric
Oberlin
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
an
Alsatian
minister
whose
pedagogical
achievements
in
a
poor
and
remote
area
had
greatly
impressed
and
inspired
them
.

Shipherd
and
Stewart
rode
south
from
Elyria
into
the
forests
that
covered
the
northern
part
of
Ohio
in
search
of
a
suitable
location
for
their
community
.

After
a
journey
of
approximately
eight
miles
,
they
stopped
to
rest
and
pray
in
the
shade
of
an
elm
tree
along
the
forest
,
and
agreed
that
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
their
community
.

Legend
has
it
that
while
they
prayed
,
a
hunter
saw
a
family
of
bears
climb
down
from
a
nearby
tree
.

The
bears
saw
the
two
men
,
but
turned
away
without
harming
them
.

On
hearing
this
story
from
the
hunter
,
the
two
ministers
took
it
to
be
a
sign
from
God
that
they
had
selected
the
right
place
for
their
community
and
school
.

Shipherd
traveled
back
east
and
convinced
the
owner
of
the
land
to
donate
of
land
for
the
school
,
and
he
purchased
an
additional
for
the
town
,
at
the
cost
of
$
0.00
per
acre
(
$
000/km
²
)
.

While
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
he
visited
many
of
his
friends
and
persuaded
some
to
join
in
his
adventure
,
and
others
to
contribute
money
towards
the
construction
of
the
community
.

The
motto
of
the
new
Oberlin
Collegiate
Institute
was
"
Learning
and
Labor
.
"

In
those
days
the
words
were
taken
quite
literally
:
tuition
at
Oberlin
was
free
,
but
students
were
expected
to
contribute
by
helping
to
build
and
sustain
the
community
.

This
attracted
a
number
of
bright
young
people
who
would
otherwise
not
have
been
able
to
afford
tuition
.

Eventually
this
approach
was
deemed
inefficient
;
the
motto
,
however
,
remains
to
this
day
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
the
worst
flood
in
Oberlin
history
occurred
on
the
same
day
that
a
tornado
killed
00
people
in
Lorain
.

Afterward
,
the
water
was
so
deep
that
children
swam
in
Tappan
Square
.

Damage
was
caused
to
all
of
downtown
Oberlin
.

The
second
largest
employer
in
Oberlin
(
after
the
eponymous
College
)
is
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
,
which
houses
an
Air
Route
Traffic
Control
Center
in
the
town
.

Cleveland
Air
Route
Traffic
Control
Center
is
one
of
the
most
transitioned
air
traffic
control
centers
in
the
country
,
and
oversees
the
airspace
over
six
states
and
a
small
part
of
Canada
.

Abolitionism
Towards
the
middle
of
the
00th
century
,
Oberlin
became
a
major
focus
of
the
abolitionist
movement
in
the
United
States
.

The
town
was
conceived
as
an
integrated
community
and
blacks
attended
Oberlin
College
from
0000
,
when
brothers
Gideon
Quarles
and
Charles
Henry
Langston
were
admitted
.

Their
younger
brother
John
Mercer
Langston
,
who
became
the
first
black
elected
to
the
United
States
Congress
from
Virginia
in
0000
,
also
graduated
from
Oberlin
.

Many
Oberlin
College
graduates
were
dedicated
abolitionists
,
who
traveled
throughout
the
South
working
to
help
slaves
escape
to
the
north
.

In
0000
,
in
response
to
a
series
of
slavery
debates
at
Lane
Theological
Seminary
,
the
trustees
of
the
Cincinnati
,
Ohio
school
voted
to
prohibit
antislavery
agitation
among
its
students
and
faculty
.

As
a
result
,
the
"
Lane
Rebels
"
,
a
group
of
about
00
students
,
trustee
Asa
Mahan
,
and
professor
John
Morgan
,
left
the
school
.

Arthur
Tappan
,
financial
agent
of
the
Oberlin
Collegiate
Institute
,
and
co-founder
John
Shipherd
,
saw
an
opportunity
to
solve
Oberlin
's
financial
problems
by
inviting
the
rebels
(
including
Mahan
and
Morgan
)
to
come
to
Oberlin
.

The
rebels
agreed
under
three
conditions
:
that
Oberlin
accept
students
regardless
of
color
,
that
Oberlin
respect
students
'
freedom
of
speech
,
and
that
Oberlin
not
"
interfere
with
the
internal
regulation
of
the
school
.
"

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
Oberlin
opened
a
new
theology
school
with
Asa
Mahan
as
President
,
Charles
Finney
as
Professor
of
theology
,
and
the
Lane
Rebels
among
the
first
theology
students
.

By
0000
,
the
town
of
Oberlin
was
an
active
terminus
on
the
underground
railroad
,
and
thousands
had
already
passed
through
it
on
their
way
to
freedom
.

This
effort
was
assisted
by
an
Ohio
law
that
allowed
fugitive
slaves
to
apply
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
,
which
protected
them
from
extradition
back
to
the
southern
states
from
which
they
had
escaped
.

In
0000
,
a
newly
elected
Democratic
state
legislature
repealed
this
law
,
making
fugitives
around
Oberlin
vulnerable
to
enforcement
of
the
Federal
Fugitive
Slave
Law
,
which
allowed
southern
slave-catchers
to
target
and
extradite
them
back
to
the
South
.

This
situation
came
to
a
head
with
the
Oberlin-Wellington
Rescue
,
a
pivotal
event
described
in
Nat
Brandt
's
book
The
Town
That
Started
the
Civil
War
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
a
fugitive
named
John
Price
was
captured
by
federal
officials
and
held
in
neighboring
Wellington
,
Ohio
.

A
large
group
of
Oberlin
residents
,
consisting
of
both
white
and
black
townspeople
,
students
,
and
faculty
,
set
out
for
Wellington
to
release
Price
from
captivity
.

The
men
took
Price
back
from
the
arresting
US
Marshal
,
and
eventually
smuggled
him
to
Canada
,
but
the
authorities
were
not
content
to
let
the
matter
rest
.

United
States
President
James
Buchanan
personally
requested
prosecution
of
the
group
(
now
referred
to
by
sympathetic
parties
as
"
the
Rescuers
"
)
,
and
00
of
them
were
indicted
.

Twelve
of
those
were
free
blacks
,
including
Charles
H.
Langston
.

State
authorities
arrested
the
US
Marshal
who
had
captured
Price
.

In
negotiation
,
the
state
agreed
to
free
the
arresters
,
and
the
federal
officials
agreed
to
free
all
but
two
of
those
indicted
.

Simeon
M.
Bushnell
,
a
white
man
,
and
Charles
H.
Langston
were
both
tried
and
convicted
by
an
all-Democrat
jury
.

Langston
's
eloquent
speech
against
slavery
and
injustice
persuaded
the
judge
to
give
them
light
sentences
.

They
appealed
to
the
Ohio
Supreme
Court
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
,
but
on
May
00
,
0000
,
their
petition
was
denied
.

The
political
ferment
resulting
from
the
case
led
to
a
number
of
major
protests
throughout
the
northern
part
of
the
state
,
and
an
unprecedented
boost
to
the
anti-slavery
Republican
party
in
the
0000
State
elections
.

The
governor
of
Ohio
wrote
to
the
new
Republican
President
Abraham
Lincoln
urging
him
to
repeal
the
Fugitive
Slave
Law
.

Though
in
point
of
fact
,
Lincoln
declined
this
request
,
his
decision
did
little
to
prevent
a
number
of
Southern
states
from
seceding
,
and
America
was
soon
embroiled
in
the
Civil
War
.

Wellington
is
a
village
in
Lorain
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census

History
Wellington
was
settled
in
0000
by
Ephraim
Wilcox
,
Charles
Sweet
,
William
T.
Welling
,
John
Clifford
,
and
Joseph
Wilson
from
the
states
of
Massachusetts
and
New
York
.

It
was
originally
named
Charlemont
by
Charles
Sweet
who
,
after
winning
a
tree
chopping
contest
,
was
given
the
right
to
name
the
township
.

It
was
later
changed
to
Wellington
by
the
townspeople
in
honor
of
one
of
the
founders
William
Welling
and
also
"
Iron
Duke
,
"
the
Duke
of
Wellington
.

Wellington
was
incorporated
as
a
village
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
former
American
House
Hotel
(
later
torn
down
and
replace
with
Herrick
Memorial
Library
)
was
the
site
of
the
Oberlin-Wellington
Rescue
.

A
group
of
men
,
both
white
and
black
and
many
from
Oberlin
,
swarmed
the
hotel
to
rescue
runaway
slave
John
Price
.

He
was
being
held
by
a
US
Marshal
and
his
men
,
who
intended
to
return
him
to
his
master
in
Kentucky
.

The
abolitionists
transported
Price
out
of
town
en
route
to
the
Underground
Railroad
and
got
him
to
Canada
.

Thirty-seven
men
were
indicted
,
but
only
two
,
Simeon
M.
Bushnell
and
Charles
Henry
Langston
,
were
tried
in
federal
court
for
interfering
with
the
marshal
in
carrying
out
the
Fugitive
Slave
Law
.

After
Langston
's
eloquent
speech
about
slavery
and
discrimination
,
the
judge
gave
them
light
sentences
.

The
events
and
trial
received
national
attention
,
and
kept
the
issue
of
slavery
at
the
forefront
of
debate
.

Holland
is
a
village
in
Lucas
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
first
name
of
the
village
was
Drakes
,
which
possibly
came
from
the
name
of
a
family
or
was
in
reference
to
the
large
number
of
geese
that
did
and
still
fly
over
the
area
.

Later
the
crossroads
called
itself
Hardy
,
which
is
probably
taken
from
Samuel
Hardy
,
who
was
one
of
the
signers
of
a
document
(
along
with
Thomas
Jefferson
,
Arthur
Lee
and
James
Monroe
)
that
ceded
the
northwest
territories
of
Virginia
to
the
government
of
the
United
States
.

He
was
a
member
of
the
Continental
Congress
in
0000-0000
and
had
been
a
lieutenant
governor
of
Virginia
.

The
name
of
Holland
has
been
thought
to
have
come
from
the
fact
that
ditches
being
dug
in
the
0000s
to
divert
the
swamp
water
reminded
people
of
the
canal
s
of
Holland
.

Some
have
said
the
name
was
given
because
of
the
large
number
of
“
Dutch
”
or
German
people
in
the
area
,
but
there
were
more
New
England
ers
and
New
York
ers
in
the
early
settlements
than
there
were
Germans
.

The
most
likely
derivation
of
the
name
comes
from
a
story
about
Franklin
Hall
(
an
early
house
builder
in
the
area
)
that
states
when
he
plat
ted
the
land
for
the
building
of
his
houses
,
he
asked
that
it
be
called
Hall
Land
.

Supposedly
,
the
clerk
or
other
official
changed
the
“
a
”
to
an
“
o
”
and
eliminated
one
“
l
”
,
thus
Holland
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
first
train
ran
between
Toledo
and
Chicago
,
on
two
roads
,
the
Michigan
Southern
and
the
Indiana
Northern
.

Three
years
later
,
the
two
railroads
consolidated
and
the
Air
Line
began
traversing
the
rails
from
Toledo
to
Elkhart
,
Indiana
.

Records
of
the
Erie
and
Kalamazoo
Railroad
show
a
station
in
the
area
in
0000
with
no
name
,
but
freight
and
passengers
from
that
site
.

In
their
records
of
0000
,
it
shows
Holland
having
a
population
of
000
people
,
with
the
tons
of
freight
increasing
almost
00
times
while
the
number
of
passengers
increased
by
approximately
000
%
from
0000
to
0000
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
Robert
Clark
began
developing
land
north
of
the
railroad
and
Franklin
Hall
built
houses
south
of
the
railroad
.

Their
names
are
still
memorialized
in
those
respective
areas
by
Clark
and
Hall
Streets

History
In
prehistoric
times
,
Native
Americans
(
notably
the
Ottawa
)
began
using
the
rich
resources
at
the
present
site
of
Maumee
,
Ohio
,
in
the
Maumee
River
valley
.

Throughout
much
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
French
,
British
and
American
forces
struggled
for
control
of
the
lower
Maumee
River
as
a
major
transportation
artery
linking
East
and
West
.

A
decisive
American
victory
over
the
British
and
their
Native
American
allies
at
the
Battle
of
Fallen
Timbers
in
0000
and
the
conclusion
of
the
War
of
0000
opened
the
way
for
American
expansion
and
attracted
promoters
eager
to
make
a
fortune
in
western
lands
.

A
town
plat
was
laid
out
in
0000
at
the
Foot
of
the
Rapids
of
the
Maumee
River
,
and
within
a
decade
,
the
settlement
was
gaining
recognition
as
a
major
trans-shipment
point
connecting
Lake
Erie
and
the
land
to
the
west
.

The
opening
of
the
Wabash
and
Erie
Canal
in
0000
further
stimulated
the
economy
and
led
Jessup
Scott
,
a
noted
town
promoter
,
to
predict
that
Maumee
would
become
the
"
great
city
of
the
West
,
"
surpassing
all
rivals
.

By
mid-century
Maumee
was
already
a
flourishing
center
of
river
trade
,
commerce
and
shipbuilding
.

Nearly
twenty
mercantile
companies
crowded
the
three
miles
(
0
km
)
of
ship
docks
and
competed
for
the
retail
and
wholesale
trade
.

Maumee
became
the
county
seat
in
0000
and
lawyers
came
from
miles
around
to
practice
in
the
imposing
Greek
Revival
Lucas
County
Courthouse
erected
by
private
subscription
.

The
federal
custom
house
and
post
office
also
were
located
in
Maumee

began
to
fade
in
the
0000s
,
when
ships
too
large
to
navigate
the
river
were
introduced
and
the
railroad
became
a
faster
and
cheaper
means
of
transportation
.

The

expanded
westward
and
Maumee
lost
the
county
seat
in

.

A
"
gas
boom
"
in

0000s
was
short
lived
and
Maumee
became
,
as
one
observer
wrote
,
"
a
sleepy
little
town
.
"

Nearly
a
century
later
,
in

0000s
,

Business
Park

.

Maumee
's
original
boundaries
have
expanded
and
the

grown
from
the
handful
of

who
applied
for
a
municipal
charter
in

to
more
than
00,000
residents
.

Maumee
's
neighborhoods
retain
their
small
town
flavor
and
many
historic
homes
and
buildings
of
the
early
residents
still
stand
along

tree-lined
streets

The
Columbian
House
Built
in
0000
,
John
Pray
constructed
a
house
to
serve
as
a
trading
post
,
tavern
and
hostel
located
in
Waterville
,
OH
.

It
became
the
centerpiece
of
the
village
.

The
place
where
locals
and
travelers
alike
escaped
from
the
harsh
Summers
and
Winters
.

Constructed
from
black
walnut
beams
,
it
quickly
transformed
in
to
a
third-story
structure
containing
a
prison
cell
(
for
transit
prisoners
)
,
a
dressmaker
's
shop
and
doctor
.

Like
many
historic
buildings
,
this
one
switched
hands
many
times
over
the
years
,
becoming
a
restaurant
between
0000
and
0000
.

Despite
its
grandeur
,
many
townsfolk
lobbied
for
its
destruction
,
believing
evil
lurked
within
.

It
was
this
evil
that
lured
the
house
's
most
famous
guest
,
Henry
Ford
in
0000
,
to
host
his
Halloween
party
there
.

Legends
ooze
out
of
its
ever
orifice
.

One
tale
describes
a
sheepherder
who
in
the
0000s
checked
in
to
the
Columbian
House
for
the
night
and
vanished
.

It
was
n't
until
00
years
later
the
truth
was
revealed
.

On
his
deathbed
,
a
farmer
confessed
to
kidnapping
and
murdering
the
sheepherder
.

He
relayed
the
location
of
the
remains
,
solving
the
mystery
.

Some
think
this
death
began
the
house
's
long
relationship
with
ghostly
inhabitants
.

Another
story
tells
of
a
young
woman
in
the
0000s
who
devised
a
plan
to
murder
her
cruel
stepfather
.

She
grabbed
a
pair
of
sewing
shears
,
held
them
above
her
head
and
stabbed
the
one
she
believed
to
be
her
stepfather
.

Unfortunately
,
her
stepbrother
was
the
one
who
died
from
her
rage
.

Her
stepfather
drug
her
into
a
room
nearby
,
locking
her
inside
.

She
remained
there
imprisoned
for
a
period
of
time
.

Some
think
she
still
remains
there
seeking
justice
that
's
rightful
hers
.

Other
stories
talk
of
a
drunk
who
was
locked
in
the
jailroom
to
sober
up
.

He
pounded
on
the
door
on
a
nightly
basis
seeking
medical
assistance
until
one
day
he
was
found
dead
in
that
locked
room
.

Today
,
the
door
refuses
to
stay
closed
and
if
it
does
,
sounds
of
banging
can
be
heard
.

An
attendee
of
an
event
held
in
the
ballroom
was
murdered
and
left
on
a
third-floor
closet
.

It
's
reported
you
can
hear
music
,
clinking
glasses
and
conversation
in
that
ballroom
.

A
young
girl
dubbed
"
Jenny
"
by
the
restaurant
staff
was
believed
to
have
died
during
the
0000
Spanish
Flu
epidemic
.

She
's
often
seen
waling
in
the
bar
room
and
playing
pranks
on
employees
.

The
Columbian
House
has
since
closed
waiting
for
someone
new
to
rescue
it
from
destruction
.

Until
then
,
you
can
enjoy
a
0/00-inch
miniature
built
by
Clayton
"
Bud
"
and
Jean
Ziegler
and
is
displayed
at
the
Hancock
Historical
Museum
.

The
model
is
fully
detailed
down
to

on
a
nightstand

a

in
a

Name
and
history
Boardman
Township
was
founded
by
Elijah
Boardman
in
the
late
0000s
.

It
is
the
only
Boardman
Township
statewide
.

Though
the
northern
areas
of
Boardman
are
suburban
spillover
from
Youngstown
,
Boardman
was
traditionally
an
agricultural
community
with
grain
crops
and
apple
orchards
.

Around
the
turn
of
the
century
,
the
railroad
led
to
Southern
Park
,
a
horse
racing
facility
on
Washington
Boulevard
.

Thus
the
area
was
an
early
draw
for
Youngstown
urbanites
.

Because
of
its
agricultural
nature
,
Boardman
was
ripe
for
strip
development
starting
as
early
as
0000
.

A
mall
and
more
One
person
who
made
a
huge
mark
in
the
area
was
Edward
DeBartolo
,
Sr.
,
who
is
best
remembered
as
the
father
of
the
American
shopping
mall
.

It
moved
from
Youngstown
to
make
its
headquarters
in
Boardman
.

After
DeBartolo
's
death
in
0000
,
the
malls
were
acquired
by
Simon
Realty
of
Indianapolis
.

Boardman
Plaza
on
U.S.
Route
000
(
west
of
Market
Street
)
was
one
of
the
first
strip
mall
s
in
the
country
.

Established
in
0000
by
DeBartolo
,
the
Plaza
had
three
full-service
grocery
stores
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
each
other
.

Today
one
must
travel
at
least
three
miles
(
0
km
)
to
get
the
same
food
service
.

Later
,
circa
0000
,
DeBartolo
opened
the
more
contemporary
Southern
Park
Mall
,
near
the
intersection
of
US
000
and
Market
Street
.

The
fast
food
chain
Arby
's
opened
its
first
location
in
Boardman
in
0000
.

The
store
remains
open
on
Route
000
near
the
Southern
Park
Mall
,
owned
and
operated
by
the
now
internationally-known
chain
.

Also
around
0000
,
the
Youngstown
Sheet
and
Tube
Company
,
one
of
the
great
steel
makers
in
the
country
,
opened
a
modern
new
suburban
headquarters
in
Boardman
(
right
across
Market
Street
from
the
DeBartolo
Corporation
)
.

Here
,
a
whole
new
"
suburban
"
work
environment
was
started
;
with
a
white
shirt
dress
code
,
it
was
antiseptic
and
wholly
removed
from
the
dirt
and
grit
of
the
Mahoning
Valley
farther
north
.

When
Youngstown
Sheet
and
Tube
closed
around
0000
,
a
nice
campus
was
left
for
others
to
develop
.

Today
,
the
former
headquarters
is
the
center
of
many
medical
offices
and
a
branch
of
Youngstown
State
University
.

Bernie
Kosar
,
the
former
Cleveland
Browns
quarterback
,
grew
up
in
Boardman
.

Kosar
's
eight
year
career
with
the
Browns
made
him
one
of
the
most
popular
football
players
in
Ohio
history
.

Government

township
is
governed
by

,
who
are

Culture
Canfield
is
a
suburb
of
Youngstown
,
with
strict
zoning
regulations
that
prohibit
large
signage
and
overgrown
lawns
.

Some
consider
it
to
be
the
most
affluent
suburb
of
Youngstown
.

A
tree-lined
"
Village
Green
"
sits
at
the
heart
of
the
New
England
-
style
village
,
which
resembles
many
communities
established
in
the
days
of
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
.

The
town
center
is
a
venue
for
a
wide
range
of
community
activities
.

In
0000
,
Canfield
city
residents
,
although
surrounded
completely
by
Canfield
Township
,
voted
to
secede
from
the
township
.

This
motion
created
two
separate
governmental
entities
—
one
a
municipality
,
the
other
a
township
.

However
this
did
not
destroy
the
community
spirit
that
exists
between
both
the
city
and
township
.

Both
cooperate
with
each
other
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
their
particular
constituents
.

An
example
of
this
is
mutual
fire
protection
service
,
communications
with
each
other
with
respect
to
roads
and
highways
,
and
the
physical
assets
of
both
(
schools
,
parks
,
etc.
)
.

The
Canfield
Local
School
District
serves
the
city
of
Canfield
,
Canfield
Township
,
and
a
small
portion
of
Boardman
and
Beaver
Township
s.
The
district
ranks
"
excellent
"
with
the
Ohio
Department
of
Education
.

The
district
,
which
operates
one
high
school
,
one
middle
school
,
and
two
elementary
schools
,
is
ranked
00th
of

.

Canfield
continues

Struthers
is
a
city
in
Mahoning
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Struthers
is
served
by
a
branch
of
the
Public
Library

Boardman
,
OH
-
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
John
Struthers
,
from
Washington
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
purchased
of
Poland
Township
land
in
0000
and
gave
it
the
name
Marbletown
.

John
Struthers
owned
this
land
the
War
of
0000
came
around
when
he
and
his
family
suffered
financial
ruin
.

This
immense
amount
of
land
would
lay
dormant
until
0000
when
it
would
be
repurchased
by
Thomas
Struthers
.

Thomas
bought
this
land
to
honor
his
father
,
he
was
instrumental
in
bringing
industry
and
railroads
to
the
town
.

Eventually
,
the
town
would
have
its
name
changed
to
Struthers
by
popular
vote
.

Influence
of
steel
The
community
's
early
history
centers
on
Yellow
Creek
where
the
cradle
of
steel
began
with
the
building
of
the
Hopewell
Furnace
.

This
furnace
was
built
in
0000
by
Daniel
Eaton
and
is
mentioned
in
the
first
line
of
the
0000
Bruce
Springsteen
song
"
Youngstown
"
.

The
Hopewell
Furnace
thrived
for
a
little
over
ten
years
until
John
Struthers
reached
his
financial
crisis
in
0000
.

In
0000
Struthers
again
became
an
iron
producing
community
with
the
construction
of
the
Anna
Furnace
by
the
Struthers
Iron
Company
.

In
0000
there
was
added
the
sheet
mill
plant
of
the
Summer
's
Brothers
Co.
,
and
in
0000
the
plant
of
the
J.
A.
and
D.
P.
Cooper
Gear
Company
.

With
all
these
activities
Struthers
still
remained
a
village
of
less
than
0,000
inhabitants
,
after
000
years
had
elapsed
since
John
.

Struthers
built
his
first
cabin
and
erected
the
sawmill
and
grist
mill
on
Yellow
Creek
.

In
0000
Struthers
was
brought
into
closer
communication
with
Youngstown
and
the
upper
Mahoning
Valley
by
the
completion
of
an
interurban
electric
line
.

In
0000
the
neighboring
village
of
East
Youngstown
(
now
Campbell
)
was
started
.

This
new
community
was
started
shortly
after
the
incorporation
of
The
Youngstown
Iron
Sheet
and
Tube
Company
(
known
as
The
Youngstown
Sheet
and
Tube
Co.
,
since
0000
)
.

With
the
steel
industry
booming
in
the
early
part
of
the
0000s
,
immigrants
from
throughout
Europe
flooded
into
Struthers
.

A
village
in
0000
when
it
was
officially
incorporated
,
Struthers
quickly
became
a
city
in
0000
.

The
steel
industry
allowed
the
city
to
flourish
until
0000
when
several
area
plants
closed
their
doors
for
good
.

The
city
padded
the
loss
of
thousands
of
jobs
by
using
its
industrial
infrastructure
to
lure
non-steel
making
jobs
,
but
population
losses
have
continued
throughout
the
start
of
the
new
century
.

Plot
In
0000
,
First
Lieutenant
John
J.
Dunbar
(
Kevin
Costner
)
is
wounded
in
the
American
Civil
War
.

Rather
than
having
his
leg
amputated
,
he
takes
a
horse
and
rides
up
to
the
Confederate
front
lines
,
distracting
them
in
the
process
.

The
roused
Union
army
then
attacks
and
the
battle
ends
in
a
Confederate
rout
.

Dunbar
survives
,
is
allowed
to
recover
properly
,
receives
a
citation
for
bravery
,
and
is
awarded
Cisco
,
the
horse
who
carried
him
,
as
well
as
his
choice
of
posting
.

Dunbar
requests
a
transfer
to
the
western
frontier
so
he
can
see
its
vast
terrain
before
it
disappears
.

Dunbar
arrives
at
his
new
post
,
Fort
Sedgwick
,
but
finds
it
abandoned
and
in
disrepair
.

Despite
the
threat
of
nearby
Native
American
tribes
,
he
elects
to
stay
and
man
the
post
himself
.

He
begins
rebuilding
and
restocking
the
fort
and
prefers
the
solitude
afforded
him
,
recording
many
of
his
observations
in
his
journal
.

Meanwhile
Timmons
,
the
wagon
driver
who
transported
Dunbar
to
Fort
Sedgwick
,
is
killed
and
scalped
by
Pawnee
Indians
on
his
way
back
to
Fort
Hayes
.

Timmons
's
death
and
the
suicide
of
Major
Fainborough
,
who
sent
them
there
,
prevents
other
soldiers
from
knowing
of
Dunbar
's
assignment
to
the
post
,
effectively
isolating
him
.

Dunbar
notes
in
his
journal
of
how
strange
it
is
that
no
other
soldiers
accompany
him
at
the
post
.

Dunbar
initially
encounters
his
Sioux
neighbors
when
several
attempts
are
made
to
steal
his
horse
and
intimidate
him
.

In
response
,
Dunbar
decides
to
seek
out
the
Sioux
camp
in
an
attempt
to
establish
a
dialogue
.

On
his
way
he
comes
across
Stands
With
A
Fist
(
Mary
McDonnell
)
,
who
has
injured
herself
in
mourning
her
deceased
husband
.

She
is
the
white
adopted
daughter
of
the
tribe
's
medicine
man
Kicking
Bird
(
Graham
Greene
)
,
her
original
family
being
killed
by
the
aggressive
Pawnee
tribe
when
she
was
young
.

Dunbar
returns
her
to
the
Sioux
to
be
treated
,
which
changes
their
attitude
toward
him
.

Eventually
,
Dunbar
establishes
a
rapport
with
Kicking
Bird
and
warrior
Wind
In
His
Hair
(
Rodney
A.
Grant
)
who
equally
wish
to
communicate
.

Initially
the
language
barrier
frustrates
them
,
so
Stands
With
A
Fist
,
though
with
difficulty
remembering
her
English
,
acts
as
translator
.

Dunbar
finds
himself
drawn
to
the
lifestyle
and
customs
of
the
tribe
and
begins
spending
most
of
his
time
with
them
.

Learning
their
language
,
he
becomes
a
hero
among
the
Sioux
and
is
accepted
as
an
honored
guest
after
he
locates
a
migrating
herd
of
buffalo
and
participates
in
the
hunt
.

When
at
Fort
Sedgwick
,
Dunbar
also
befriends
a
wolf
he
dubs
"
Two
Socks
"
for
its
white
forepaws
.

When
the
Sioux
observe
Dunbar
and
Two
Socks
chasing
each
other
,
they
give
him
his
Sioux
name
"
Dances
with
Wolves
"
.

During
this
time
,
Dunbar
also
forges
a
romantic
relationship
with
Stands
with
a
Fist
and
helps
defend
the
village
from
an
attack
by
the
rival
Pawnee
tribe
.

Dunbar
eventually
wins
Kicking
Bird
's
approval
to
marry
Stands
with
a
Fist
,
and
abandons
Fort
Sedgwick
.

Because
of
the
growing
Pawnee
and
white
threat
,
Chief
Ten
Bears
(
Floyd
Red
Crow
Westerman
)
decides
to
move
the
tribe
to
its
winter
camp
.

Dunbar
decides
to
accompany
them
but
must
first
retrieve
his
journal
from
Fort
Sedgwick
as
he
realises
that
the
journal
is
the
blueprint
to
the
army
for
finding
the
tribe
and
that
he
knows
too
much
about
their
ways
.

However
,
when
he
arrives
he
finds
it
occupied
by
the
U.S.
Army
.

Because
of
his
Sioux
clothing
,
the
soldiers
see
him
as
a
native
and
a
threat
and
open
fire
,
killing
Cisco
and
capturing
Dunbar
,
arresting
him
as
a
traitor
.

Sgt
Bauer
(
Larry
Joshua
)
with
the
generals
and
major
,
interrogate
him
,
but
Dunbar
can
not
prove
his
situation
,
as
Corporal
Spivey
(
Tony
Pierce
)
had
secretly
stolen
his
journal
.

As
a
result
,
along
with
Dunbar
's
refusal
to
serve
as
an
interpreter
to
the
tribes
,
he
is
put
on
trial
for
treason
and
transported
back
east
as
a
prisoner
to
be
hanged
.

While
travelling
in
the
armed
caravan
,
the
soldiers
shoot
Two
Socks
when
the
wolf
attempts
to
follow
Dunbar
despite
Dunbar
's
attempts
to
intervene
.

Eventually
the
Sioux
track
the
convoy
,
killing
the
soldiers
and
freeing
Dunbar
.

At
the
winter
camp
,
Dunbar
decides
to
leave
with
Stands
With
A
Fist
,
since
his
status
will
put
the
tribe
in
danger
.

As
they
leave
,
Wind
In
His
Hair
shouts
across
to
Dunbar
,
reminding
him
of
their
friendship
.

U.S.
troops
are
seen
searching
the
mountains
but
are
unable
to
locate
them
,
while
a
lone
wolf
howls
in
the
distance
.

An
epilogue
states
that
thirteen
years
later
the
last
remnants
of
Sioux
were
subjugated
to
the
American
government
,
ending
the
conquest
of
the
Western
frontier
states
and
the
livelihoods
of
the
tribes
in
the
plains
.

Cast
Production
Originally
written
as
a
spec
script
by
Michael
Blake
,
it
went
unsold
in
the
mid-0000s
.

It
was
Kevin
Costner
who
,
in
early
0000
(
when
he
was
relatively
unknown
)
,
encouraged
Blake
to
turn
the
screenplay
into
a
novel
,
to
improve
its
chances
of
being
adapted
into
a
film
.

The
novel
manuscript
of
Dances
with
Wolves
was
rejected
by
numerous
publishers
but
finally
published
in
paperback
in
0000
.

As
a
novel
,
the
rights
were
purchased
by
Costner
,
with
an
eye
on
directing
it
.

Actual
production
lasted
for
four
months
,
from
July
00
to
November
00
,
0000
.

Most
of
the
movie
was
filmed
on
location
in
South
Dakota
,
mainly
near
Pierre
and
Rapid
City
,
with
a
few
scenes
filmed
in
Wyoming
.

Specific
locations
included
the
Badlands
National
Park
,
the
Black
Hills
,
the
Sage
Creek
Wilderness
Area
,
and
the
Belle
Fourche
River
area
.

The
buffalo
hunt
scenes
were
filmed
at
the
Triple
U
Buffalo
Ranch
outside
Fort
Pierre
,
South
Dakota
,
as
were
the
Fort
Sedgwick
scenes
,
the
set
being
constructed
on
the
property
.

Production
delays
were
numerous
,
because
of
South
Dakota
's
unpredictable
weather
,
the
difficulty
of
"
directing
"
barely
trainable
wolves
,
and
the
complexity
of
the
Indian
battle
scenes
.

Particularly
arduous
was
the
film
's
centerpiece
buffalo
hunt
sequence
:
this
elaborate
chase
was
filmed
over
three
weeks
using
000
Indian
stunt
riders
and
an
actual
stampeding
herd
of
several
thousand
buffalo
.

During
one
shot
,
Costner
(
who
did
almost
all
of
his
own
horseback
riding
)
was
"
T-boned
"
by
another
rider
and
knocked
off
his
horse
,
nearly
breaking
his
back
.

The
accident
is
captured
in
The
Creation
of
an
Epic
,
the
behind-the-scenes
documentary
on
the
Dances
with
Wolves
Special
Edition
DVD
.

According
to
the
documentary
,
none
of
the
buffalo
were
computer
animated
(
CGI
was
then
in
its
infancy
)
and
only
a
few
were
animatronic
or
otherwise
fabricated
.

In
fact
,
Costner
and
crew
employed
the
largest
domestically
owned
buffalo
ranch
,
with
two
of
the
domesticated
buffalo
being
borrowed
from
Neil
Young
;
this
was
the
herd
used
for
the
buffalo
hunt
sequence
.

Budget
overruns
were
inevitable
,
owing
to
Costner
's
breaking
several
unspoken
Hollywood
"
rules
"
for
first-time
directors
:
traditionally
,
they
avoid
both
shooting
outside
and
working
with
children
and
animals
as
much
as
possible
.

As
a
result
,
late
in
the
production
Costner
was
forced
to
add
$
0
million
personally
in
out-of-pocket
money
to
the
film
's
original
$
00-million
budget
.

Referring
to
the
infamous
fiasco
of
Michael
Cimino
's
0000
Heaven
's
Gate
,
considered
the
most
mismanaged
Western
in
film
history
,
Costner
's
project
was
satirically
dubbed
"
Kevin
's
Gate
"
by
Hollywood
critics
and
pundits
skeptical
of
a
three-hour
,
partially
subtitled
Western
by
a
novice
filmmaker
.

The
film
changed
the
novel
's
Comanche
Indians
to
Sioux
,
because
of
the
larger
number
of
Sioux
speakers
.

Lakota
Sioux
language
instructor
Doris
Leader
Charge
(
0000
–
0000
)
was
the
on-set
Lakota
dialogue
coach
and
also
portrayed
Pretty
Shield
,
wife
of
Chief
Ten
Bears
.

Despite
portraying
the
adopted
daughter
of
Graham
Greene
's
character
Kicking
Bird
,
Mary
McDonnell
,
then
00
,
was
actually
two
months
older
than
Greene
,
and
less
than
two
years
younger
than
Tantoo
Cardinal
,
the
actress
playing
her
adoptive
mother
.

In
addition
,
McDonnell
was
extremely
nervous
about
shooting
her
sex
scene
with
Kevin
Costner
,
requesting
it
be
toned
down
to
a
more
modest
version
than
what
was
scripted
.

Reception
Defying
expectation
,
Dances
with
Wolves
proved
instantly
popular
,
eventually
making
$
000
million
in
U.S.
box
office
sales
,
and
$
000
million
in
total
sales
worldwide
.

The
movie
won
the
Best
Picture
Academy
Award
against
strong
competition
,
notably
Martin
Scorsese
's
Goodfellas
.

As
of
0000
,
the
film
holds
a
positive
review
score
of
00
%
on
Rotten
Tomatoes
.

Because
of
the
film
's
popular
and
lasting
impact
,
the
Sioux
Nation
adopted
Costner
as
an
honorary
member
.

In
0000
,
the
Library
of
Congress
selected
Dances
with
Wolves
for
preservation
in
the
United
States
National
Film
Registry
.

Native
American
activist
and
actor
Russell
Means
was
less
kind
about
some
aspects
of
the
film
's
technical
accuracy
.

In
0000
,
he
said
"
Remember
Lawrence
of
Arabia
?

That
was
Lawrence
of
the
Plains
.

The
odd
thing
about
making
that
movie
is
that
they
had
a
woman
teaching
the
actors
the
Lakota
language
,
but
Lakota
has
a
male-gendered
language
and
a
female-gendered
language
.

Some
of
the
Indians
and
Kevin
Costner
were
speaking
in
the
feminine
way
.

When
I
went
to
see
it
with
a
bunch
of
Lakota
guys
,
we
were
laughing
.
"

Other
Native
Americans
like
Michael
Smith
(
Sioux
)
,
Director
of
San
Francisco
's
long-running
annual
American
Indian
Film
Festival
,
said
,
"
There
's
a
lot
of
good
feeling
about
the
film
in
the
Indian
community
,
especially
among
the
tribes
.

I
think
it
's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
top
this
one
.
"

According
to
other
sources
the
gender
specific
Lakota
words
were
used
correctly
in
the
movie
.

Some
of
the
criticism
was
inspired
by
the
fact
that
the
pronunciation
is
not
authentic
since
none
of
the
actors
except
for
one
were
native
speakers
of
the
language
.

The
movie
's
dialogues
in
the
native
language
has
been
lauded
as
a
remarkable
achievement
.

However
,
other
writers
have
brought
out
that
earlier
films
had
also
incorporated
Native
dialogue
such
as
in
Eskimo
(
0000
)
,
Wagon
Master
(
0000
)
,
and
The
White
Dawn
(
0000
)
.

Sequel
The
Holy
Road
,
a
well-received
sequel
novel
by
Michael
Blake
,
the
author
of
both
the
original
Dances
with
Wolves
novel
and
the
movie
screenplay
,
was
published
in
0000
.

It
picks
up
eleven
years
after
Dances
with
Wolves
.

John
Dunbar
is
still
married
to
Stands
with
a
Fist
and
they
have
three
children
.

Stands
with
a
Fist
and
one
of
the
children
are
kidnapped
by
a
party
of
white
rangers
and
Dances
with
Wolves
must
mount
a
rescue
mission
.

As
of
0000
,
Blake
was
writing
a
film
adaptation
,
although
Kevin
Costner
was
not
yet
attached
to
the
project
.

In
the
end
,
however
,
Costner
stated
he
would
not
take
part
in
this
production
.

Viggo
Mortensen
has
been
rumored
to
be
attached
to
the
project
,
playing
Dunbar
.

Historical
references
Judith
A.
Boughter
wrote
:
"
The
problem
with
Costner
's
approach
is
that
all
of
the
Sioux
are
heroic
,
while
the
Pawnee
s
are
portrayed
as
stereotypical
villains
.

Most
accounts
of
Sioux-Pawnee
relations
see
the
Pawnees
as
victims
of
the
more
powerful
Sioux
.
"

St.
David
's
Field
,
Tennessee
does
not
exist
nor
did
it
in
0000
.

As
the
opening
battle
is
a
minor
portion
of
the
film
,
it
was
considered
undesirable
to
name
an
actual
historical
battle
,
which
might
result
in
knowledgeable
viewers
taking
exception
to
fictional
events
.

Fort
Sedgwick
,
Colorado
was
erected
as
Camp
Rankin
and
renamed
for
General
John
Sedgwick
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

Sedgwick
was
killed
May
0
,
0000
,
at
the
Battle
of
Spotsylvania
Court
House
,
Virginia
.

Fort
Sedgwick
served
as
an
army
post
from
July
0000
to
May
0000
.

John
Sedgwick
did
erect
a
fort
in
Kansas
in
0000
.

Fort
Hays
,
Kansas
was
named
for
General
Alexander
Hays
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

Hays
was
killed
May
0
,
0000
,
in
the
Battle
of
the
Wilderness
,
Virginia
.

Fort
Hays
served
as
an
army
post
from
October
00
,
0000
,
to
November
0
,
0000
.

There
was
a
real
John
Dunbar
who
worked
as
a
missionary
for
the
Pawnee
in
the
0000s
–
00s
,
and
sided
with
the
Indians
in
a
dispute
with
government
farmers
and
a
local
Indian
agent
.

It
is
unclear
if
the
name
"
John
Dunbar
"
was
chosen
as
a
corollary
to
the
real
historical
figure
.

The
fictional
Lieutenant
John
Dunbar
of
0000
is
correctly
shown
in
the
film
wearing
a
gold
bar
on
his
officer
shoulder
straps
,
indicating
his
rank
as
a
First
Lieutenant
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
the
rank
of
First
Lieutenant
was
indicated
by
a
gold
bar
;
after
0000
,
the
rank
was
indicated
by
a
silver
bar
.

Similarly
,
Captain
Cargill
is
correctly
depicted
wearing
a
pair
of
gold
bars
,
indicating
the
rank
of
Captain
at
that
time
.

In
an
interview
,
author
and
screenwriter
Michael
Blake
said
that
Stands
With
a
Fist
,
the
white
captive
woman
who
marries
Dunbar
,
was
actually
based
upon
the
story
of
Cynthia
Ann
Parker
,
the
white
girl
captured
by
Comanches
and
mother
of
Quanah
Parker
.

The
description
at
the
finale
is
correct
;
00
years
after
the
film
is
set
,
the
last
band
of
free
Sioux
were
forced
into
a
humiliating
surrender
at
Fort
Robinson
,
Nebraska
,
and
the
dominance
and
prevalence
of
the
Plains
Indians
was
over
.

The

History
Founded

settlement
in
Medina
County
.

It
was
originally
called
Harrisville
,

.

It
was
later
renamed
to
Lodi
,
the
Indian
chief
who
lived
nearby
;
to
prevent
confusion
with
another
village
in
Ohio
.

Ainsworth
Street
,
part
of
the
'
Downtown
Circle
'
,
is
named
after
Chief
Lodi
's
Daughter
.

Facts
An
early
pioneer
named
Redfield
(
after
whom
Redfield
Street
is
named
)
sculpted
the
modern
route
to
Medina
through
trees
.

It
was
later
deemed
too
curvy
,
so
the
first
governmental
road
through
the
region
was
straightened
.

In
later
years
,
this
road
became
U.S.
Route
00
.

as
the
first
black
man
to
be
a
part
of
their
government
since

History
Medina
was
founded
in
0000
as
part
of
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
.

It
was
originally
named
Mecca
,
but
another
Ohio
town
had
that
name
,
so
the
name
was
changed
.

Both
Mecca
and
Medina
are
cities
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
particularly
significant
to
Islam
.

Most
early
residents

In
the
0000s
growth
of
the
community
was
aided
by
the
completion
of
the
Ohio
and
Erie
Canal
,
which
helped
transport
agricultural
products
to
markets
.

In
0000
,
Medina
was
incorporated
as
a
village
and
as
the
county
seat
of
Medina
County
,
Ohio
.

In
0000
Amos
Root
founded
the
A.I.
Root
Company
in
Medina
as
a
manufacturer
of
beehive
s
and
beekeeping
equipment
,
and
the
town
became
a

Awakenings
is
a
0000
American
drama
film
based
on
Oliver
Sacks
's
0000
memoir
Awakenings
.

It
tells
the
true
story
of
British
neurologist
Oliver
Sacks
,
fictionalized
as
American
Malcolm
Sayer
and
portrayed
by
Robin
Williams
who
,
in
0000
,
discovers
beneficial
effects
of
the
then-new
drug
L-Dopa
.

He
administered
it
to
catatonic
patients
who
survived
the
0000
–
00
epidemic
of
encephalitis
lethargica
.

Leonard
Lowe
(
played
by
Robert
De
Niro
)
and
the
rest
of
the
patients
were
awakened
after
decades
of
catatonia
and
have
to
deal
with
a
new
life
in
a
new
time
.

The
film
was
nominated
for
three
Academy
Awards
.

Directed
by
Penny
Marshall
,
the
film
was
produced
by
Walter
Parkes
and
Lawrence
Lasker
,
who
first
encountered
Sacks
's
book
as
undergraduates
at
Yale
University
and
optioned
it
a
few
years
later
.

Robin
Williams
,
Julie
Kavner
,
Ruth
Nelson
,
John
Heard
,
Penelope
Ann
Miller

and
Max
Von
Sydow

The
film
features
a
non-speaking
cameo
from
jazz
legend
Dexter
Gordon
(
who
died
before
the
film
's
release
)
who
appears
as
a
patient
and
then-unknowns
Bradley
Whitford
,
Peter
Stormare
,
Vin

,
and
Vincent
Pastore
play
a

,

,

and

respectively
.

Plot
In
0000
,
Dr.
Malcolm
Sayer
(
Robin
Williams
)
is
a
dedicated
and
caring
physician
at
a
local
hospital
in
the
New
York
City
borough
of
The
Bronx
.

After
working
extensively
with
the
catatonic
patients
who
survived
the
0000-0000
epidemic
of
encephalitis
lethargica
,
Sayer
discovers
certain
stimuli
will
reach
beyond
the
patients
'
respective
catatonic
states
;
actions
such
as
catching
a
ball
thrown
at
them
,
hearing
familiar
music
,
and
experiencing
human
touch
all
have
unique
effects
on
particular
patients
and
offer
a
glimpse
into
their
worlds
.

Leonard
Lowe
(
Robert
De
Niro
)
proves
elusive
in
this
regard
,
but
Sayer
soon
discovers
that
Leonard
is
able
to
communicate
with
him
by
using
a
Ouija
board
.

After
attending
a
lecture
at
a
conference
on
the
subject
of
the
L-Dopa
drug
and
its
success
with
patients
suffering
from
Parkinson
's
Disease
,
Sayer
believes
the
drug
may
offer
a
breakthrough
for
his
own
group
of
patients
.

A
trial
run
with
Leonard
Lowe
yields
astounding
results
as
Leonard
completely
"
awakens
"
from
his
catatonic
state
;
this
success
inspires
Sayer
to
ask
for
funding
from
donors
so
that
all
the
catatonic
patients
can
receive
the
L-Dopa
medication
and
experience
"
awakenings
"
back
to
reality
.

Meanwhile
,
Leonard
is
adjusting
to
his
new
life
and
becomes
romantically
interested
in
Paula
(
Penelope
Ann
Miller
)
,
the
daughter
of
another
hospital
patient
and
begins
spending
time
with
her
when
she
comes
to
the
hospital
to
visit
her
father
.

Leonard
also
begins
to
chafe
at
the
restrictions
placed
upon
him
as
a
patient
of
the
hospital
,
desiring
the
freedom
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleases
and
stirs
up
a
bit
of
a
revolt
in
the
process
of
arguing
his
case
repeatedly
to
Sayer
and
the
hospital
administration
.

Sayer
notices
that
as
Leonard
grows
more
agitated
battling
administrators
and
staff
about
his
perceived
confinement
,
a
number
of
facial
and
body
tics
are
starting
to
manifest
and
Leonard
has
difficulty
controlling
them
.

While
Sayer
and
the
hospital
staff
continue
to
delight
in
the
success
of
L-Dopa
with
this
group
of
patients
,
they
soon
find
that
it
is
a
temporary
measure
.

As
the
first
to
"
awaken
"
,
Leonard
is
also
the
first
to
demonstrate
the
limited
duration
of
this
period
of
"
awakening
"
.

Leonard
's
tics
grow
more
and
more
prominent
and
he
starts
to
shuffle
more
as
he
walks
,
and
all
of
the
patients
are
forced
to
witness
what
will
eventually
happen
to
them
.

He
soon
begins
to
suffer
full
body
spasms
and
can
hardly
move
.

Leonard
,
however
,
puts
up
well
with
the
pain
,
and
asks
Sayer
to
film
him
,
in
hopes
that
he
would
some
day
contribute
to
research
that
may
eventually
help
others
.

Leonard
acknowledges
sadly
what
is
happening
to
him
and
has
a
last
lunch
with
Paula
where
he
tells
her
he
can
not
see
her
anymore
.

When
he
is
about
to
leave
,
Paula
dances
with
him
,
and
for
this
short
period
of
time
his
spasms
disappear
.

Leonard
and
Dr.
Sayer
reconcile
their
differences
,
but
Leonard
returns
to
his
catatonic
state
soon
after
.

The
other
patients
'
fears
are
similarly
realized
as
each
eventually
returns
to
catatonia
no
matter
how
much
their
L-Dopa
dosages
are
increased
.

Sayer
tells
a
group
of
grant
donors
to
the
hospital
that
although
the
"
awakening
"
did
not
last
,
another
kind
—
one
of
learning
to
appreciate
and
live
life
—
took
place
.

For
example
,
he
himself
,
who
is
painfully
shy
,
decides
to
go
ask
Nurse
Eleanor
Costello
(
Julie
Kavner
)
to
coffee
,
many
months
after
he
had
declined
a
similar
proposal
from
her
.

The
nurses
also
now
treat
the
catatonic
patients
once
again
with
more
respect
and
care
,
and
Paula
is
shown
visiting
Leonard
.

The
film
ends
with
Sayer
standing
over
Leonard
behind
a
Ouija
board
,
with
his
hands
on
Leonard
's
hands
which
are
on
the
planchette
.

Let
's
begin

Sayer
says
.

After

reexperienced
what
it
means
to
be
born

to
open
your
eyes
and
discover
to
your
astonishment
that

you

are
alive

"

Owen
Gleiberman
of
Entertainment
Weekly
praised
the
film
's
performances
,
citing
,
"
There
's
a
raw
,
subversive
element
in
De
Niro
's
performance
:
He
does
n't
shrink
from
letting
Leonard
seem
grotesque
.

Yet
Awakenings
,
unlike
the
infinitely
superior
Rain
Man
,
is
n't
really
built
around
the
quirkiness
of
its
lead
character
.

The
movie
views
Leonard
piously
;
it
turns
him
into
an
icon
of
feeling
.

And
so
even
if
you
're
held
(
as
I
was
)
by
the
acting
,
you
may
find
yourself
fighting
the
film
's
design
.
"

Oliver
Sacks
,
the
author
of
the
novel
on
which
the
film
is
based
,
"
was
pleased
with
a
great
deal
of
[
the
film
]
,
"
explaining
to
Salon.com
,
"
I
think
in
an
uncanny
way
,
De
Niro
did
somehow
feel
his
way
into
being
Parkinsonian
.

So
much
so
that
sometimes
when
we
were
having
dinner
afterwards
I
would
see
his
foot
curl
or
he
would
be
leaning
to
one
side
,
as
if
he
could
n’t
seem
to
get
out
of
it
.

I
think
it
was
uncanny
the
way
things
were
incorporated
.

At
other
levels
I
think
things
were
sort
of
sentimentalized
and
simplified
somewhat
.
"

Desson
Howe
of
The
Washington
Post
felt
the
film
's
tragic
aspects
did
not
live
up
to
the
strength
in
its
humor
,
saying
that
"
when
nurse
Julie
Kavner
(
another
former
TV
being
)
delivers
the
main
Message
(
life
,
she
tells
Williams
,
is
"
given
and
taken
away
from
all
of
us
"
)
,
it
does
n't
sound
like
the
climactic
point
of
a
great
movie
.

It
sounds
more
like
a
line
from
one
of
the
more
sensitive
episodes
of
Laverne
and
Shirley
.
"

Similarly
,
Janet
Maslin
of
The
New
York
Times
concluded
her
review
stating
,
"
Awakenings
works
harder
at
achieving
such
misplaced
liveliness
than
at
winning
its
audience
over
in
other
ways
.

Celina
(
)
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Mercer
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Celina
is
situated
on
the
western
shores
of
Grand
Lake
St.
Marys
.

History
James
Watson
Riley
established
Celina
in
0000
.

Celina
is
the
county
seat
of
Mercer
County
.

While
traveling
through
New
York
state
to
get
the
town
plat
lithographed
,
Riley
came
across
the
town
of
Salina
situated
on
the
edge
of
Onondaga
Lake
near
Syracuse
.

Noting
the
similarity
between
Salina
and
the
newly
founded
settlement
in
Ohio
,
he
named
the
new
town
Celina
.

The
spelling
was
changed
to
avoid
confusion
at
the
post
office
,
or
so
the
story
is
told
from
past
legends
.

Another
legend
has
it
that
the
spelling
was
changed
because
in
Salina
,
NY
,
Main
Street
is
oriented
east-west
(
also
Market
Street
is
oriented
north-south
)
,
where
in
Celina
,
OH
,
Main
Street
is
oriented
north-south
(
and
Market
Steet
is
oriented
east-west
)
.

the
community
,
but
over
the
next
decade
,
Celina
’s
population
nearly
doubled
to
0,000
inhabitants
.

The
primary
reason
for
this
population
growth
was
the
discovery
of
oil
and
natural
gas
deposits
during
the
0000s
.

In

,
Celina
contained
three
newspaper

establishments
existed
in

community
,

surrounding
countryside
.

This
has
held
true
throughout

century

Early
history
Deep
into
remote
times
dip
the
history
of
what
once
was
Shanesville
,
later
Shane
's
Crossing
,
and
last
by
Post
Office
Department
decree
,
Rockford
.

This
community
is
rich
in
lore
and
legend
.

There
is
no
doubt
that
the
high
ground
adjacent
to
the
St.
Marys
River
at
Rockford
served
as
a
camping
ground
and
village
site
for
Indian
tribes
long
before
Columbus
discovered
America
.

Weapons
,
tools
,
arrow
heads
and
stone
axes
tell
of
long
occupancy
.

From
time
immemorial
the
St.
Marys
River
has
been
a
busy
thoroughfare
for
traders
,
trappers
,
and
adventurers
.

Trails
along
the
banks
of
the
rivers
were
used
greatly
,
one
of
these
became
known
as
the
Piqua-Fort
Wayne
Trail
,
which
crossed
to
the
north
side
of
the
river
here
,
a
part
of
the
journey
from
the
Great
Lakes
to
the
Ohio
River
.

The
earliest
records
of
the
history
of
Rockford
and
community
,
begins
with
that
of
Anthony
Madore
,
a
French-Indian
who
ran
a
trading
post
located
just
north
of
the
Junction
of
Routes
000
and
00
,
and
east
of
the
Rockford
American
Legion
home
.

It
is
not
known
how
long
Madore
owned
the
post
,
but
he
died
around
0000
.

A
few
years
before
this
period
were
the
bloody
Indian
Wars
.

The
Miamis
and
the
Shawnees
and
other
tribes
were
then
entrenched
in
their
stronghold
at
Fort
Wayne
.

General
Josiah
Harmar
and
his
army
went
through
Rockford
en
route
to
Fort
Wayne
where
he
was
more
or
less
defeated
.

This
bloodshed
went
on
unchecked
until
General
Anthony
Wayne
came
on
the
scene
.

After
mopping
up
at
Fort
Recovery
,
he
built
a
stockade
which
was
unsuccessfully
stormed
by
the
Indians
.

He
made
his
way
diagonally
across
Mercer
County
to
the
St.
Marys
where
he
built
Fort
Adams
,
a
temporary
relay
station
and
supply
depot
,
east
of
U.S.
Route
000
,
North
of
Mercer
.

Wayne
and
his
army
dealt
the
Indians
many
defeats
.

During
the
War
of
0000
,
Rockford
heard
martial
music
.

General
William
Henry
Harrison
camped
here
with
his
army
en
route
to
Detroit
to
fight
the
British
and
their
Indian
allies
.

He
was
joined
at
Rockford
by
000
mounted
Ohio
volunteers
and
000
foot
soldiers
.

The
Indians
who
were
besieging
the
garrison
at
Fort
Wayne
fled
when
Harrison
's
army
approached
.

When
Tecumseh
,
the
famous
Indian
warrior
was
killed
in
a
duel
with
Col.
Richard
M.
Johnson
at
the
Battle
of
Thames
,
this
almost
ended
the
War
of
0000
in
this
country
.

Anthony
Shane
Anthony
Shane
,
a
French-Indian
and
his
wife
lived
for
years
in
a
double-log
cabin
,
just
north
of
the
town
now
named
Rockford
.

He
ran
a
trading
post
and
for
his
services
as
a
scout
for
the
army
of
General
Anthony
Wayne
was
given
a
large
tract
of
land
known
as
the
Shanes
Grant
,
and
all
abstracts
of
title
for
royalty
here
start
with
this
grant
.

The
grant
consisted
of
north
of
the
town
and
at
the
town
site
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
Shane
filed
his
plot
to
the
town
of
Shanesville
which
then
comprised
00
lots
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
.

Shane
lived
here
until
0000
when
he
acted
as
a
government
agent
and
accompanied
the
Shawnee
Indians
to
Kansas
.

It
is
not
known
if
he
ever
returned
to
this
part
of
the
country
.

celebrates
the
village
's

Cyanobacteria
(
)
,
also
known
as
blue-green
bacteria
,
blue-green
algae
,
and
Cyanophyta
,
is
a
phylum
of
bacteria
that
obtain
their
energy
through
photosynthesis
.

The
name
"
cyanobacteria
"
comes
from
the
color
of
the
bacteria
(
=
blue
)
.

The
ability
of
cyanobacteria
to
perform
oxygenic
photosynthesis
is
thought
to
have
converted
the
early
reducing
atmosphere
into
an
oxidizing
one
,
which
dramatically
changed
the
composition
of
life
forms
on
Earth
by
stimulating
biodiversity
and
leading
to
the
near-extinction
of
oxygen-intolerant
organisms
.

According
to
endosymbiotic
theory
,
the
chloroplast
s
found
in
plants
and
eukaryotic
algae
evolved
from
cyanobacterial
ancestors
via
endosymbiosis
.

Ecology
Cyanobacteria
can
be
found
in
almost
every
terrestrial
and
aquatic
habitat
—
oceans
,
fresh
water
,
damp
soil
,
temporarily
moistened
rocks
in
desert
s
,
bare
rock
and
soil
,
and
even
Antarctic
rocks
.

They
can
occur
as
planktonic
cells
or
form
phototrophic
biofilms
.

They
are
found
in
almost
every
endolithic
ecosystem
.

A
few
are
endosymbiont
s
in
lichen
s
,
plants
,
various
protist
s
,
or
sponge
s
and
provide
energy
for
the
host
.

Some
live
in
the
fur
of
sloth
s
,
providing
a
form
of
camouflage
.

Aquatic
cyanobacteria
are
known
for
their
extensive
and
highly
visible
blooms
that
can
form
in
both
freshwater
and
marine
environments
.

The
blooms
can
have
the
appearance
of
blue-green
paint
or
scum
.

These
blooms
can
be
toxic
,
and
frequently
lead
to
the
closure
of
recreational
waters
when
spotted
.

Marine
bacteriophage
s
are
significant
parasites
of
unicellular
marine
cyanobacteria
.

Characteristics
Nitrogen
fixation
Cyanobacteria
include
unicellular
and
colonial
species
.

Colonies
may
form
filaments
,
sheets
or
even
hollow
balls
.

Some
filamentous
colonies
show
the
ability
to
differentiate
into
several
different
cell
types
:
vegetative
cells
,
the
normal
,
photosynthetic
cells
that
are
formed
under
favorable
growing
conditions
;
akinete
s
,
the
climate-resistant
spores
that
may
form
when
environmental
conditions
become
harsh
;
and
thick-walled
heterocysts
,
which
contain
the
enzyme
nitrogenase
,
vital
for
nitrogen
fixation
.

Heterocysts
may
also
form
under
the
appropriate
environmental
conditions
(
anoxic
)
when
fixed
nitrogen
is
scarce
.

Heterocyst-forming
species
are
specialized
for
nitrogen
fixation
and
are
able
to
fix
nitrogen
gas
into
ammonia
(
)
,
nitrites
(
)
or
nitrates
(
)
which
can
be
absorbed
by
plants
and
converted
to
protein
and
nucleic
acids
(
atmospheric
nitrogen
is
not
bioavailable
to
plants
)
.

Rice
plantations
utilize
healthy
populations
of
nitrogen-fixing
cyanobacteria
(
Anabaena
,
as
symbiotes
of
the
aquatic
fern
Azolla
)
for
use
as
rice
paddy
fertilizer
.

Cyanobacteria
are
arguably
the
most
successful
group
of
microorganisms
on
earth
.

They
are
the
most
genetically
diverse
;
they
occupy
a
broad
range
of
habitats
across
all
latitudes
,
widespread
in
freshwater
,
marine
and
terrestrial
ecosystems
,
and
they
are
found
in
the
most
extreme
niches
such
as
hot
springs
,
salt
works
,
and
hypersaline
bays
.

Photoautotrophic
,
oxygen-producing
cyanobacteria
created
the
conditions
in
the
planet
's
early
atmosphere
that
directed
the
evolution
of
aerobic
metabolism
and
eukarotic
photosynthesis
.

Cyanobacteria
fulfill
vital
ecological
functions
in
the
world
's
oceans
,
being
important
contributors
to
global
carbon
and
nitrogen
budgets
.

–
Stewart
and
Falconer
Ecology
Many
cyanobacteria
form
motile
filaments
of
cells
,
called
hormogonia
,
that
travel
away
from
the
main
biomass
to
bud
and
form
new
colonies
elsewhere
.

The
cells
in
a
hormogonium
are
often
thinner
than
in
the
vegetative
state
,
and
the
cells
on
either
end
of
the
motile
chain
may
be
tapered
.

In
order
to
break
away
from
the
parent
colony
,
a
hormogonium
often
must
tear
apart
a
weaker
cell
in
a
filament
,
called
a
necridium
.

Each
individual
cell
of
a
cyanobacterium
typically
has
a
thick
,
gelatinous
cell
wall
.

They
lack
flagella
,
but
hormogonia
of
some
species
can
move
about
by
gliding
along
surfaces
.

Many
of
the
multi-cellular
filamentous
forms
of
Oscillatoria
are
capable
of
a
waving
motion
;
the
filament
oscillates
back
and
forth
.

In
water
columns
some
cyanobacteria
float
by
forming
gas
vesicles
,
as
in
archaea
.

These
vesicles
are
not
organelle
s
as
such
.

They
are
not
bounded
by
lipid
membranes
but
by
a
protein
sheath
.

Some
of
these
organisms
contribute
significantly
to
global
ecology
and
the
oxygen
cycle
.

The
tiny
marine
cyanobacterium
Prochlorococcus
was
discovered
in
0000
and
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
the
photosynthesis
of
the
open
ocean
.

Many
cyanobacteria
even
display
the
circadian
rhythms
that
were
once
thought
to
exist
only
in
eukaryotic
cells
(
see
bacterial
circadian
rhythms
)
.

Photosynthesis
Carbon
fixation
Cyanobacteria
account
for
00
–
00
%
of
Earth
's
photosynthetic
productivity
and
convert
solar
energy
into
biomass-stored
chemical
energy
at
the
rate
of
~
000
TW
.

Cyanobacteria
utilize
the
energy
of
sunlight
to
drive
photosynthesis
,
a
process
where
the
energy
of
light
is
used
to
split
water
molecules
into
oxygen
,
protons
,
and
electrons
.

While
most
of
the
high-energy
electrons
derived
from
water
are
utilized
by
the
cyanobacterial
cells
for
their
own
needs
,
a
fraction
of
these
electrons
are
donated
to
the
external
environment
via
electrogenic
activity
.

Cyanobacterial
electrogenic
activity
is
an
important
microbiological
conduit
of
solar
energy
into
the
biosphere
.

Metabolism
and
organelles
As
with
any
prokaryotic
organism
,
cyanobacteria
do
not
have
nuclei
or
an
internal
membrane
system
.

However
,
many
species
of
cyanobacteria
have
folds
on
their
external
membranes
which
function
in
photosynthesis
.

Cyanobacteria
get
their
colour
from
the
bluish
pigment
phycocyanin
,
which
they
use
to
capture
light
for
photosynthesis
.

Photosynthesis
in
cyanobacteria
generally
uses
water
as
an
electron
donor
and
produces
oxygen
as
a
by-product
,
though
some
may
also
use
hydrogen
sulfide
a
process
which
occurs
among
other
photosynthetic
bacteria
such
as
the
purple
sulfur
bacteria
.

Carbon
dioxide
is
reduced
to
form
carbohydrate
s
via
the
Calvin
cycle
.

In
most
forms
the
photosynthetic
machinery
is
embedded
into
folds
of
the
cell
membrane
,
called
thylakoid
s.
The
large
amounts
of
oxygen
in
the
atmosphere
are
considered
to
have
been
first
created
by
the
activities
of
ancient
cyanobacteria
.

Due
to
their
ability
to
fix
nitrogen
in
aerobic
conditions
they
are
often
found
as
symbiont
s
with
a
number
of
other
groups
of
organisms
such
as
fungi
(
lichen
s
)
,
coral
s
,
pteridophyte
s
(
Azolla
)
,
angiosperm
s
(
Gunnera
)
etc.
.

Many
cyanobacteria
are
able
to
reduce
nitrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
under
aerobic
conditions
,
a
fact
that
may
be
responsible
for
their
evolutionary
and
ecological
success
.

The
water-oxidizing
photosynthesis
is
accomplished
by
coupling
the
activity
of
photosystem
(
PS
)
II
and
I
(
Z-scheme
)
.

In
anaerobic
conditions
,
they
are
also
able
to
use
only
PS
I
—
cyclic
photophosphorylation
—
with
electron
donors
other
than
water
(
hydrogen
sulfide
,
thiosulphate
,
or
even
molecular
hydrogen
)
just
like
purple
photosynthetic
bacteria
.

Furthermore
,
they
share
an
archaea
l
property
,
the
ability
to
reduce
elemental
sulfur
by
anaerobic
respiration
in
the
dark
.

Their
photosynthetic
electron
transport
shares
the
same
compartment
as
the
components
of
respiratory
electron
transport
.

Their
plasma
membrane
contains
only
components
of
the
respiratory
chain
,
while
the
thylakoid
membrane
hosts
an
interlinked
respiratory
and
photosynthetic
electron
transport
chain
.

The
terminal
oxidases
in
the
thylakoid
membrane
respiratory/photosynthetic
electron
transport
chain
are
essential
for
survival
to
rapid
light
changes
,
although
not
for
dark
maintenance
under
conditions
where
cells
are
not
light
stressed
.

Attached
to
thylakoid
membrane
,
phycobilisome
s
act
as
light
harvesting
antennae
for
the
photosystems
.

The
phycobilisome
components
(
phycobiliprotein
s
)
are
responsible
for
the
blue-green
pigmentation
of
most
cyanobacteria
.

The
variations
on
this
theme
are
mainly
due
to
carotenoid
s
and
phycoerythrin
s
which
give
the
cells
the
red-brownish
coloration
.

In
some
cyanobacteria
,
the
color
of
light
influences
the
composition
of
phycobilisomes
.

In
green
light
,
the
cells
accumulate
more
phycoerythrin
,
whereas
in
red
light
they
produce
more
phycocyanin
.

Thus
the
bacteria
appear
green
in
red
light
and
red
in
green
light
.

This
process
is
known
as
complementary
chromatic
adaptation
and
is
a
way
for
the
cells
to
maximize
the
use
of
available
light
for
photosynthesis
.

A
few
genera
,
however
,
lack
phycobilisomes
and
have
chlorophyll
b
instead
(
Prochloron
,
Prochlorococcus
,
Prochlorothrix
)
.

These
were
originally
grouped
together
as
the
prochlorophytes
or
chloroxybacteria
,
but
appear
to
have
developed
in
several
different
lines
of
cyanobacteria
.

For
this
reason
they
are
now
considered
as
part
of
the
cyanobacterial
group
.

Relationship
to
chloroplasts
Cladogram
showing
plastids
(
chloroplasts
and
similar
)
and
basal
cyanobacteria
Chloroplast
s
found
in
eukaryote
s
(
algae
and
plants
)
likely
evolved
from
an
endosymbiotic
relation
with
cyanobacteria
.

This
endosymbiotic
theory
is
supported
by
various
structural
and
genetic
similarities
.

Primary
chloroplasts
are
found
among
the
"
true
plant
s
"
or
green
plant
s
–
species
ranging
from
sea
lettuce
to
evergreen
s
and
flower
s
which
contain
chlorophyll
b
–
as
well
as
among
the
red
alga
e
and
glaucophyte
s
,
marine
species
which
contain
phycobilins
.

It
now
appears
that
these
chloroplasts
probably
had
a
single
origin
,
in
an
ancestor
of
the
clade
called
Archaeplastida
.

Other
algae
likely
took
their
chloroplasts
from
these
forms
by
secondary
endosymbiosis
or
ingestion
.

Earth
history
Stromatolites
of
fossil
ized
oxygen-producing
cyanobacteria
have
been
found
from
0.0
billion
years
ago
,
possibly
from
0.0
billion
years
ago
.

The
biochemical
capacity
to
use
water
as
the
source
for
electrons
in
photosynthesis
evolved
once
,
in
a
common
ancestor
of
extant
cyanobacteria
.

The
geologic
record
indicates
that
this
transforming
event
took
place
early
in
our
planet
's
history
,
at
least
0000-0000
million
years
ago
(
mya
)
,
and
probably
much
earlier
.

Geobiological
interpretation
of
Archean
(
>
0000
mya
)
sedimentary
rocks
remains
a
challenge
;
available
evidence
indicates
that
life
existed
0000
mya
,
but
the
question
of
when
oxygenic
photosynthesis
evolved
continues
to
engender
debate
and
research
.

A
clear
paleontological
window
on
cyanobacterial
evolution
opened
about
0000
mya
,
revealing
an
already
diverse
biota
of
blue-greens
.

Cyanobacteria
remained
principal
primary
producers
throughout
the
Proterozoic
(
0000-000
mya
)
,
in
part
because
the
redox
structure
of
the
oceans
favored
photoautotroph
s
capable
of
nitrogen
fixation
.

The
most
common
cyanobacterial
structures
in
the
fossil
record
are
the
mound-producing
stromatolite
s
and
related
oncolite
s.
Indeed
,
these
fossil
colonies
are
so
common
that
paleobiology
,
micropaleontology
and
paleobotany
cite
the
Pre-Cambrian
and
Cambrian
period
as
an
"
age
of
stromatolites
"
and
an
"
age
of
algae
.
"

Green
algae
joined
the
blue-greens
as
major
primary
producers
on
continental
shelves
near
the
end
of
the
Proterozoic
,
but
only
with
the
Mesozoic
era
(
000-00
mya
)
radiations
of
dinoflagellate
s
,
coccolithophorid
s
,
and
diatom
s
did
primary
production
in
marine
shelf
waters
take
modern
form
.

Today
,
the
blue-green
bacteria
remain
critical
to
marine
ecosystems
as
primary
producers
in
oceanic
gyre
s
,
as
agents
of
biological
nitrogen
fixation
,
and
—
in
modified
form
—
as
the
plastids
of
marine
algae
.

Classification
Historically
,
Bacteria
were
first
classified
as
plant
s
constituting
the
class
Schizomycetes
,
which
along
with
the
Schizophyceae
(
blue
green
algae/Cyanobacteria
)
formed
the
phylum
Schizophyta
.

then
in
the
phylum
Monera
in
the
kingdom
Protista
by
Haeckel
in
0000
,
comprising
Protogens
,
Protamaeba
,
Vampyrella
,
Protomonae
and
Vibrio
,
but
not
Nostoc
and
other
cyanobacteria
,
which
were
classified
with
algae
later
reclassified
as
the
Prokaryotes
by
Chatton
.

The
cyanobacteria
were
traditionally
classified
by
morphology
into
five
sections
,
referred
to
by
the
numerals
I-V
.

The
first
three
–
Chroococcales
,
Pleurocapsales
,
and
Oscillatoriales
–
are
not
supported
by
phylogenetic
studies
.

However
,
the
latter
two
–
Nostocales
and
Stigonematales
–
are
monophyletic
,
and
make
up
the
heterocystous
cyanobacteria
.

The
members
of
Chroococales
are
unicellular
and
usually
aggregate
in
colonies
.

The
classic
taxonomic
criterion
has
been
the
cell
morphology
and
the
plane
of
cell
division
.

In
Pleurocapsales
,
the
cells
have
the
ability
to
form
internal
spores
(
baeocytes
)
.

The
rest
of
the
sections
include
filamentous
species
.

In
Oscillatoriales
,
the
cells
are
uniseriately
arranged
and
do
not
form
specialized
cells
(
akinetes
and
heterocysts
)
.

In
Nostocales
and
Stigonematales
the
cells
have
the
ability
to
develop
heterocysts
in
certain
conditions
.

Stigonematales
,
unlike
Nostocales
,
includes
species
with
truly
branched
trichomes
.

Most
taxa
included
in
the
phylum
or
division
Cyanobacteria
have
not
yet
been
validly
published
under
the
Bacteriological
Code
.

Except
:
Biotechnology
and
applications
The
unicellular
cyanobacterium
Synechocystis
sp
.

PCC0000
was
the
third
prokaryote
and
first
photosynthetic
organism
whose
genome
was
completely
sequenced
.

It
continues
to
be
an
important
model
organism
.

The
smallest
genomes
have
been
found
in
Prochlorococcus
spp
.

(
0.0
Mb
)
and
the
largest
in
Nostoc
punctiforme
(
0
Mb
)
.

Those
of
Calothrix
spp
.

are
estimated
at
00
–
00
Mb
,
as
large
as
yeast
.

Some
cyanobacteria
are
sold
as
food
,
notably
Aphanizomenon
flos-aquae
and
Arthrospira
platensis
(
Spirulina
)
.

Recent
research
has
suggested
the
potential
application
of
cyanobacteria
to
the
generation
of
renewable
energy
via
converting
sunlight
into
electricity
.

Currently
efforts
are
underway
to
commercialize
algae
-
based
fuels
such
as
diesel
,
gasoline
and
jet
fuel
.

Researchers
from
a
company
called
Algenol
have
cultured
genetically
modified
cyanobacteria
in
sea
water
inside
a
clear
plastic
enclosure
so
that
they
first
make
sugar
(
pyruvate
)
from
CO0
and
the
water
via
photosynthesis
.

Then
,
the
bacteria
secrete
ethanol
from
the
cell
into
the
salt
water
.

As
the
day
progresses
,
and
the
solar
radiation
intensifies
,
ethanol
concentrations
build
up
and
the
ethanol
itself
evaporates
onto
the
roof
of
the
enclosure
.

As
the
sun
recedes
,
evaporated
ethanol
and
water
condenses
into
droplets
,
which
run
along
the
plastic
walls
and
into
ethanol
collectors
,
from
where
it
is
extracted
from
the
enclosure
with
the
water
and
ethanol
separated
outside
the
enclosure
.

As
of
September
0000
,
Algenol
was
claiming
to
have
tested
its
technology
on
0
acres
in
Florida
and
to
have
achieved
yields
of
0,000
US
gallons
per
acre
(
00,000
litres
per
hectare
)
each
year
.

This
could
potentially
meet
US
demands
for
ethanol
in
gasoline
in
0000
,
assuming
a
B00
blend
,
from
an
area
of
around
half
the
size
of
California
’s
San
Bernardino
County
,
requiring
less
than
one
tenth
of
the
area
than
ethanol
from
other
biomass
,
such
as
corn
,
and
only
very
limited
amounts
of
fresh
water
.

Cyanobacteria
may
possess
the
ability
to
produce
substances
that
could
one
day
serve
as
anti-inflammatory
agents
and
combat
bacterial
infections
in
humans
.

Health
risks
Some
cyanobacteria
produce
toxin
s
,
called
cyanotoxin
s.
These
include
anatoxin-a
,
anatoxin-as
,
aplysiatoxin
,
cylindrospermopsin
,
domoic
acid
,
microcystin
LR
,
nodularin
R
(
from
Nodularia
)
,
neosaxitoxin
and
saxitoxin
.

Cyanobacteria
reproduce
explosively
under
certain
conditions
.

This
results
in
algal
bloom
s
,
which
can
become
harmful
to
other
species
if
the
cyanobacteria
involved
produce
toxins
.

These
toxins
can
be
neurotoxins
,
hepatotoxins
,
cytotoxins
,
and
endotoxins
,
and
can
be
toxic
and
dangerous
to
humans
as
well
as
other
animals
and
marine
life
in
general
.

Several
cases
of
human
poisoning
have
been
documented
but
a
lack
of
knowledge
prevents
an
accurate
assessment
of
the
risks
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
significant
exposure
to
high
levels
of
some
species
of
cyanobacteria
producing
toxins
such
as
BMAA
can
cause
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
,
also
known
as
Lou
Gehrig
's
Disease
)
.

The
Lake
Mascoma
ALS
cluster
and
Gulf
War
veteran
's
cluster
are
two
notable
examples
.

Dietary
supplementation
Microalgae
contain
substances
of
high
biological
value
,
such
as
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
,
amino
acids
(
proteins
)
,
pigments
,
antioxidants
,
vitamins
and
minerals
.

Edible
blue-green
algae
reduce
the
production
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
by
inhibiting
NF-κB
pathway
in
macrophages
and
splenocytes
.

Consumption
of
edible
blue
green
algae
may
also
reduce
risks
of
cataracts
and
age
related
macular
degeneration
.

It
has
also
shown
mitigative
effects
in
animal
models
of
non-alcohol
related
liver
disease
,
such
as
steatohepatitis
,
and
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Sulfate
polysaccharides
exhibit
immunomodulatory
,
antitumor
,
antithrombotic
,
anticoagulant
,
anti-mutagenic
,
anti-inflammatory
,
antimicrobial
,
and
even
antiviral
activity
against
HIV
,
herpes
,
and
hepatitis
.

They
also
improve
insulin
resistance
in
HIV
.

They
also
protect
against
aflatoxin
and
cisplatin
chemotherapy
induced
liver
damage
.

These
positive
health
benefits
must
be
distinguished
from
non-edible
species
of
algae
,
which
are
detrimental
to
health
.

Plot
Sam
Wheat
(

)
,
a
banker
,
and
Molly
Kaplan
(
Demi

)
,
a
talented

,
are
a
loving
couple
who
move
into
a
New

City
apartment
.

At
work
,
Sam
discovers
a
major
discrepancy
in
multiple
bank
accounts
and
confides
in
his
good
friend
and
colleague
Carl
Bruner
(
Tony
Goldwyn
)
.

Carl
offers
to
investigate
the
matter
,
but
Sam
decides
to
investigate
himself
.

Later
that
night
,
Sam
and
Molly
are
attacked
by
armed
thug
Willie
Lopez
(
Rick
Aviles
)
and
Sam
is
killed
by
a
gunshot
during
a
struggle
with
Willie
.

Sam
's
ghost
arises
from
his
dead
body
,
which
lies
next
to
the
distraught
Molly
.

He
gradually
realizes
that
he
is
a
ghost
whose
presence
can
not
be
seen
or
heard
.

One
day
,
Sam
is
alone
at
the
apartment
(
testing
his
ability
to
walk
through
doors
)
when
Willie
comes
in
,
looking
for
something
.

Sam
is
unable
to
stop
the
killer
but
spooks
Molly
's
cat
,
Floyd
,
causing
Willie
to
get
scratched
and
flee
.

Sam
follows
the
killer
to
his
place
in
Brooklyn
and
hears
that
he
will
return
to
Molly
's
house
.

He
also
meets
Oda
Mae
Brown
(
Whoopi

)
,
a
local
con
artist
posing
as
a
medium
and
realizes
she
can
hear
him
(
not
see
him
)
,
although
Oda
Mae
had
been
faking
her
abilities
until
then
.

He
persuades
Oda
Mae
to
tell
Molly
that
she
is
in
danger
,
but
Molly
is
disbelieving
and
Carl
later
convinces
Molly
that
Oda
Mae
is
a
fraud
preying
on
her
grief
.

Molly
talks
to
the
police
about
her
concerns
but
they
confirm
that
Oda
Mae
is
a
known
confidence
trickster
with
a
lengthy
record
whereas
Willie
Lopez
has
none
.

Sam
discovers
that
Carl
was
involved
in
a
money
laundering
scheme
at
the
bank
and
that
the
attack
was
an
attempt
by
Carl
to
acquire

he
could
transfer
the

.

He
learns
how
to
move
solid
objects
by
willpower
from
an
aggressive
New
York
City
subway
poltergeist
(
Vincent
Schiavelli
)
he
meets
in
the
subway
.

He
persuades
Oda
Mae
to
thwart
Carl
's
money
laundering
scheme
.

Following
his
instructions
,
Oda
Mae
impersonates
the
owner
of
Carl
's
fake
bank
account
,
closes
the
account
,
and
reluctantly
gives
its
$
0
million
contents
to
a
homeless
shelter
.

Carl
,
due
to
transfer
the
money
to
a
correspondent
bank
overseas
,
becomes
desperate
when
he
finds
the
account
closed
and
empty
.

Sam
taunts
him
in
the
deserted
office
by
moving
objects
and
making
accusations
appear
on
his
computer
screen
,
repeatedly
typing
"
MURDERER
"
and
"
SAM
"
.

Carl
visits
Molly
and
declares
to
Sam
that
he
will
kill
Molly
unless
the
money
is
returned
that
evening
.

He
and
Willie
then
go
to
Oda
Mae
's
apartment
to
find
her
.

Sam
manages
to
get
there
first
and
warns
Oda
Mae
and
her
two
sisters
,
who
quickly
escape
and
take
refuge
in
a
neighbor
's
apartment
.

Sam
uses
his
powers
to
separate
and
distract
Carl
and
Willie
,
who
are
ransacking
Oda
Mae
's
apartment
in
search
of
the
money
.

Horrified
by
the
experience
,
Willie
flees
and
is
killed
in
a
traffic
accident
.

Willie
's
ghost
arises
,
sees
his
body
,
and
is
told
by
Sam
that
he
's
dead
.

A
group
of
howling
demons
emerge
from
shadows
of
ordinary
things
and
pull
a
screaming
Willie
into
the
shadows
,
while
Sam
watches
in
horror
.

It
is
implied
they
take
him
to
Hell
.

Afterwards
,
Sam
and
Oda
Mae
return
to
Molly
's
apartment
to
warn
her
about
Carl
,
but
she
refuses
to
let
her
in
and
breaks
down
in
grief
.

Sam
finally
convinces
her
that
Oda
Mae
is
genuine
and
he
is
truly
present
as
a
ghost
by
having
her
push
a
penny
underneath
the
front
door
and
Sam
levitating
it
in
front
of
Molly
.

Astonished
,
Molly
lets
Ode
Mae
inside
and
while
waiting
for
the
police
,
Sam
uses
Oda
Mae
's
body
to
share
a
final
dance
with
Molly
.

Carl
arrives
,
prepared
to
murder
Molly
and
Oda
Mae
,
but
they
flee
.

Sam
is
left
momentarily
weakened
,
as
possession
is
taxing
to
a
ghost
.

In
the
storage
room
,
Carl
manages
to
get
a
hold
of
Oda
Mae
and
threatens
to
kill
her
,
but
Molly
comes
to
her
aid
and
holds
Carl
off
long
enough
for
Oda
Mae
to
escape
his
grasp
.

Carl
grabs
Molly
and
holds
her
at
gunpoint
for
the
money
but
is
unsuccessful
and
as
Sam
recovers
he
is
able
to
disarm
Carl
and
attack
him
.

As
Carl
attempts
to
flee
through
a
plate
glass
window
,
he
flings
a
scaffolding
hook
in
Sam
's
direction
which
swings
back
and
partially
shatters
the
glass
in
the
upper
part
of
the
window
;
the
window
slides
down
and
kills
Carl
as
he
climbs
out
.

Carl
becomes
a
ghost
himself
much
to
his
astonishment
and
to
Sam
's
grief
.

Sam
then
watches
in
silence
as
the
shadowy
demons
arrive
and
drag
a
screaming
Carl
into
the
darkness
.

As
Sam
goes
to
Oda
Mae
and
Molly
and
asks
if
they
are
all
right
,
Molly
suddenly
realizes
that
she
can
hear
him
.

A
heavenly
light
fills
the
room
and
Sam
becomes
fully
visible
to
both
Molly
and
Oda
Mae
.

Sam
looks
behind
him
and
sees
hundreds
of
people
,
presumably
angels
,
in
a
portal
to
Heaven
.

His
task
is
completed
and
he
can
move
on
.

Sam
says
an
emotional
farewell
to
Molly
,
thanks
Oda
Mae
for
her
help
,
and
departs
to
the
afterlife
.

History
Although
officially
incorporated
in
0000
,
Piqua
's
history
dates
back
to
a
previous
settlement
in
0000
called
Fort
Pickawillany
located
a
mile
northeast
of
the
present
city
at
the
Great
Miami
River
's
intersection
with
Loramie
Creek
.

Piqua
started
out
as
two
separate
communities
,
Upper
Piqua
and
Lower
Piqua
in
0000
becoming
one
community
by
0000
.

Rossville
(
since
incorporated
into
Piqua
)
was
the
first
local
African-American
settlement
after
the
Randolph
slaves
were
freed
following
the
passing
of
John
Randolph
in
0000
.

The
Rossville
neighborhood
and
Randolph
cemetery
are
located
on
the
northeast
side
of
the
river
off
North
County
Road
00-A
.

Piqua
was
home
to
the
first
municipally-operated
nuclear
power
plant
,
Piqua
Nuclear
Generating
Station
,
in
operation
from
0000
to
0000
earning
its
short
lived
nickname
"
The
Atomic
City
.
"

This
facility
was
a
major
demonstration
failure
and
the
Atomic
Energy
Commission
bought
out
the
contract
with
the
City
of
Piqua
,
for
an
early
contract
termination
.

During
this
period
a
name
brand
automotive
battery
,
the
"
Piqua
Atomic
Power
Plant
"
was
manufactured
and
marketed
locally
.

Piqua
is
believed
to
be
a
reference
to
the
Shawnee
Indian
phrase
:
"
Othath-He-Waugh-Pe-Qua
"
translated
as
"
He
has
risen
from
the
ashes
!
"

The
phrase
is
mentioned
in
a
painting
of
a
Native
American
rising
up
above
the
flames
before
a
tribe
of
onlookers
in
a
state
of
amazement
.

The
painting
is
on
public
display
inside
the
main
office
of
Unity
National
Bank
,
the
former
Third
Savings
and
Loan
Association
in
downtown
Piqua
.

The
legendary
story
depicted
led
to
the
name
of
the
Pekowi
,
one
of
the
five
divisions
of
the
Shawnee
people
,
who
once
lived
there
and
,
eventually
,
"
Piqua
.
"

Piqua
's
Shawnee
Native
American
history
became
the
namesake
for
the
community
of
Shawnee
,
founded
in
0000
which
is
bordered
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
adjacent
to
downtown
and
the
former
Pennsylvania
Railroad
corridor
later
used
by
the
merged
Penn
Central
Transportation
and
subsequently
by
Conrail
.

Shawnee
has
also
long
since
been
incorporated
into
Piqua
.

The
Piqua
High
School
Indians
athletic
teams
also
took
its
inspiration
from
its
local
Native
American
history
.

Piqua
has
two
Main
Streets
,
the
one
being
north
and
southbound
along
Miami
County
Road
00-A
(
the
former
U.S.
Highway
00
,
also
known
as
the
Dixie
Highway
)
the
other
running
east
through
Shawnee
.

U.S.

also
runs
through
much
of
the
city
,
cutting
the
town
almost
directly
in
half
.

Main
and
Ash
Streets
(
U.S.

)
converge
in
Piqua
's
downtown
.

Also

downtown
is

Conrail
corridor
which
was
originally
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
two-track
throughway
which
was
abandoned
in
0000
.

A
section
of
it
became
a
bike
trail
in
the
summer
of
0000
now
known
as
Linear
Park
.

The
remaining
rail
line
serving
Piqua
is

now
operated

Dominating
Piqua
's
downtown
,
the
"
Orr-Statler
Block
"
building
at
the
corner
of
Main
and
High
Streets
,
was
erected
in
0000
.

For
many
years
its
core
tenant
was
a
hotel
of
over
one
hundred
rooms
,
first
known
as
the
"
Plaza
"
and
later
as
the
"
Favorite
"
and
finally
the
"
Fort
Piqua
,
"
which
closed
in
the
0000s
.

The
building
's
street
level
commercial
spaces
were
occupied
by
a
variety
of
businesses
over
the
years
,
including
a
barbershop
,
a
grocer
,
a
bank
,
the
local
telephone
company
business
office
,
Western
Union
,
a
combination
bus
station
and
taxi
office
with
a
very
popular
soda
fountain
and
lunch
counter
and
others
.

The
hotel
's
bar
was
moved
to
the
corner
basement
location
just
prior
to
Prohibition
's
start
and
is
rumored
to
have
closed
only
its
outside
entrance
during
those
years
.

After
a
period
of
disrepair
and
neglect
and
the
announcements
of
several
renewal
plans
which
never
secured
adequate
funding
,
the
building
underwent
a
massive
and
long
awaited
major
interior
renovation
.

After
two
years
of
work
,
the
building
became
the
home
of
Piqua
's
public
library
.

The
renovated
building
was
renamed
and
rededicated
,
and
is
now
known
as
Fort
Piqua
Plaza
.

Economy
The
city
of
Piqua
is
the
home
of
Hartzell
Propeller
,
the
leading
producer
of
small
aircraft
propellers
in
the
world
.

Evenflo
of
Piqua
(
formerly
Questor
Juvenile
Furniture
)
is
the
leading
manufacturer
of
infant

toddler
car
seats
and
has
become
one
of
Piqua
's
leading
employers
and
industries
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
Southwest
Ohio
was
the
heart
of
the
US
flaxseed
growing
area
,
and
there
were
as
many
as
00
linseed
oil
mills
in
Piqua
,
where
the
flaxseed
was
"
crushed
"
to
extract
the
vegetable
oil
,
named
linseed
oil
.

The
flax
fiber
was
used
for
cloth
and
paper
,
and
the
oil
was
used
for
a
variety
of
industrial
uses
.

The
name
linoleum
comes
from
the
linseed
oil
which
is
the
binder
.

One
of
the
vegetable
oil
mills
in
Piqua
burned
down
—
a
common
fate
for
wooden
buildings
soaked
with
vegetable
oil
—
and
the
owner
,
American
Linseed
Oil
Company
,
dispatched
Alfred
Willard
French
,
their
Chief
Engineer
,
from
Brooklyn
,
New
York
,
to
organize
and
supervise
the
rebuilding
of
the
oil
mill
.

During
the
rebuilding
of
the
linseed
oil
mill
,
French
included
a
machine
he
had
invented
and
patented
in
0000
,
a
"
cake
trimmer
"
,
and
purchased
the
most
modern
equipment
then
available
.

He
met
the
leading
citizens
of
Piqua
.

They
were
impressed
with
this
engineer
,
who
had
graduated
from
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
in
only
three
years
,
and
had
entrepreneurial
spirit
;
they
decided
to
invest
in
a
new
company
he
wanted
to
start
.

The
French
Oil
Mill
Machinery
Company
was
founded
00
May
0000
,
with
French
as
president
,
to
make
"
improved
oil
mill
machinery
"
.

By
0000
the
company
was
exporting
its
patented
and
rugged
vegetable
oil
mill
extraction
machinery
all
around
the
world
.

Today
,
the
company
has
customers
in
over
00
countries
,
still
serving
the
vegetable
oil
extraction
market
(
to
press
such
seeds
as
soybeans
,
cottonseed
,
rapeseed
,
canola
,
and
many
others
)
.

In
addition
,
the
company
is
a
world
leader
in
synthetic
rubber
dewatering
and
drying
machinery
,
and
in
hydraulic
molding
presses
for
rubber
,
thermoplastic
and
composite
materials
.

The
city
also
was
a
major
center
of
underwear
production
during
the
late
00th
century
and
much
of
the
00th
century
.

A
yearly
Outdoor
Underwear
Festival
was
held
downtown
from
0000
until
shortly
after
the
demise
and
demolition
of
the
factory
owned
by
Medalist-Allen
A
,
a
direct
descendant
of
the
Atlas
Underwear
Company
.

Originally
the
festival
had
a
serious
historical
focus
,
but
in
later
years
it
attracted
adventurous
types
from
surrounding
towns
,
and
Piqua
residents
discouraged
their
own
children
from
attending
.

Heritage
Green
Park
now
occupies
the
former
Medalist
factory
site
.

The
Meteor
Motor
Car
Company
(
later
the
Miller-Meteor
division
of
Richmond
,
Indiana
-
based
school
bus
manufacturer
Wayne
Corporation
)
had
a
brief
run
as
an
independent
record
label
and
phonograph
manufacturer
in
the
0000s
.

Afterward
,
Miller-Meteor
produced
ambulances
and
hearses
before
closing
down
in
0000
.

The
Piqua
Coca-Cola
Bottling
Company
,
owned
by
the
Lange
family
,
was
located
on
the
downtown
square
at
the
northeast
corner
of
Main
and
High
streets
.

It
produced
its
signature
product
along
with
Sprite
,
Tab
and
Fresca
in
glass
bottles
for
the
Upper
Miami
Valley
while
metal
canned
versions
were
shipped
in
from
a
plant
in
Speeedway
,
Indiana
.

It
was
later
purchased
by
the
Dayton
Coca-Cola
Bottling
Company
in
the
mid-0000s
.

However
,
the
increased
demand
for
Coke
products
in
two
liter
plastic
bottles
and
cans
led
to
the
aging
local
plant
's
unfeasibility
,
hence
its
eventual
demise
and
was
closed
down
and
razed
by
the
end
of
the
decade
.

A
newer
bottling
plant
now
exists
in
Huber
Heights

"

The
large
red

which
contained
the

is
now
a
much
sought-after
collector

History
Tippecanoe
City
was
founded
in
0000
along
the
developing
Miami
and
Erie
Canal
.

Its
name
derives
from
Presidential
candidate
William
Henry
Harrison
's
nickname
,
Tippecanoe
,
which
,
in
turn
,
was
derived
from
his
heroism
at
the
Battle
of
Tippecanoe
,
November
0
,
0000
.

The
early
city
was
a
popular
stopping-off
point
for
boatmen
traveling
along
the
Miami
and
Erie
Canal
.

The
original
downtown
purportedly
included
a
large
number
of
bars
and
a
red
light
district
.

The
now
dry
canal
locks
can
be
seen
just
east
of
downtown
.

As
Tippecanoe
City
grew
,
it
merged
with
Hyattsville
,
a
contiguous
village
,
located
on
present-day
Hyatt
Street
.

Development
of
the
railroads
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
put
the
canals
out
of
business
and
slowed
the
city
's
initially
rapid
growth
.

Ruins
of
a
repair
shop
(
yard
barn
)
for
the
old
Inter-Urban
rail
system
can
still
be
seen
on
the
outskirts
of
town
.

The
development
of
U.S.
Highway
00
(
County
Road
00-A
)
and
subsequently
Interstate
00
brought
construction
and
vibrance
back
to
the
town
throughout
the
00th
century
.

History
of
city
name
The
dramatic
modern
growth
of
the
town
has
occurred
under
a
new
name
:
Tipp
City
.

The
US
Postal
Service
abbreviated
the
town
's
name
in
the
0000s
to
resolve
a
conflict
with
Tippecanoe
,
Ohio
.

Some
local
controversy
exists
as
to
whether
the
name
can
or
should
revert
to
the
former
Tippecanoe
City
.

Proponents
of
the
change
argue
that
ZIP
code
s
obviate
the
conflict
.

Tipp
City
and
Tippecanoe
are
000
miles
apart
.

Tippecanoe
is
too
small
for
many
Ohio
maps
and
is
not
even
one
of
the
00
incorporated
municipalities
of
Harrison
County
.

The
sparsely
populated
Harrison
County
is
the
0th
smallest
of
Ohio
's
00
counties
.

Downtown
Tipp
City
businesses
that
wish
to
play
up
the
Tippecanoe
City
00th
century
heritage
have
argued
that
modern
geography
and
postal
methods
would
alleviate
any
confusion
in
reverting
to
the
old
name
.

On
the
other
hand
,
residents
are
used
to
the
name
Tipp
City
.

Addresses
and
signage
would
have
to
be
changed
if
renaming
were
sought
.

While
the
city
's
name
was
changed
long
ago
,
the
high
school
never
changed
its
name
;
Tippecanoe
High
School
,
is
a
constant
reminder
to
people
in
the
area
of
what
"
Tipp
"
refers
to
.

Currently
,
the
issue
does
not
seem
to
matter
enough
to
most
residents
to
prompt
political
action
.

Economics
Tipp
City
functions
as
a
bedroom

Englewood
,
a
northern
suburb
of
Dayton
,
is
a
city
in
Montgomery
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Dayton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Although
Englewood
was
not
actually
founded
until
0000
,
many
early
settlers
began
to
come
to
the
area
known
as
Randolph
Township
around
0000
.

Earliest
settlers
were
the
families
of
David
Hoover
,
David
Mast
,
Daniel
Hoover
,
Robert
Ewing
,
John
and
Abraham
McClintock
,
John
Rench
,
Martin
Sheets
,
Jacob
Smith
,
Daniel
and
Peter
Fetters
.

Also
among
the
early
settlers
were
the
families
of
the
Ellers
,
Fouts
,
Frantzs
,
Wertzs
and
the
Brumbaughs
,
to
mention
some
.

Direct
descendants
of
many
of
these
families
reside
in
the
community
today
.

The
early
settlers
made
their
living
basically
from
agriculture
.

They
shipped
grain
and
bacon
down
the
Stillwater
River
on
flat
bottom
boats
to
Dayton
and
as
far
south
as
New
Orleans
.

There
was
also
a
considerable
amount
of
industry
,
including
saw
mill
s
,
gun
smithing
,
wine
distilling
and
pottery
manufacturing
.

There
were
many
Native
Americans
in
the
area
in
the
early
days
;
however
,
they
were
not
hostile
and
traded
with
the
settlers
.

There
was
also
an
abundance
of
wildlife
which
afforded
good
hunting
for
the
settlers
’
food
requirements
.

Following
primarily
the
path
traced
through
this
area
by
the
Stillwater
River
,
a
group
of
settlers
founded
what
is
now
the
City
of
Englewood
on
May
0
,
0000
.

These
pioneers
included
Mathias
Gish
,
Daniel
Rasor
and
Samuel
Herr
.

Some
of
these
settlers
came
from
the
area
around
Harrisburg
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
thus
named
the
community
Harrisburg
.

Other
residents
came
from
Randolph
County
,
North
Carolina
,
and
named
this
township
accordingly
.

Harrisburg
’s
first
post
office
was
opened
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
discontinued
on
February
0
,
0000
.

The
post
office
was
re-established
on
May
0
,
0000
,
and
the
first
postmaster
was
Harvey
Iams
.

The
town
was
then
renamed
Iamton
.

However
,
at
that
time
the
capital
letters
I
and
J
were
the
same
in
the
alphabet
and
the
town
became
known
as
Jamton
.

In
0000
,
the
local
businessmen
conducted
a
contest
to
choose
a
new
name
for
the
town
.

The
name
Englewood
was
chosen
as
the
winner
of
that
contest
and
the
town
of
Jamton
was
renamed
Englewood
.

The
Village
of
Englewood
was
incorporated
on
May
00
,
0000
,
and
Jacob
Hoover
was
the
first
mayor
.

The
population
had
risen
to
000
by
0000
and
over
000
by
0000
.

The
present
population
is
estimated
at
nearly
00,000
.

Englewood
became
a
city
in

.

Natural
gas
was
made
available
to
the
area
in

,
the
first
water
works
was

,
Joe
Mantegna
,
George
Hamilton
,
Bridget
Fonda
,
and
Sofia
Coppola
.

Coppola
and
Puzo
originally
wanted
the
title
to
be
The
Death
of
Michael
Corleone
but
this
was
not
acceptable
to
Paramount
Pictures
.

Coppola
states
that
The
Godfather
series
is
in
fact
two
films
,
and
Part
III
is
the
epilogue
.

Part
III
received
mixed
to
positive
reviews
,
grossed
$
000,000,000
and
was
nominated
for
seven
Academy
Award
s.
Plot
In
0000
,
Michael
Corleone
(
Al
Pacino
)
is
nearing
00
and
wracked
with
guilt
for
his
ruthless
rise
to
power
,
especially
ordering
the
murder
of
his
brother
Fredo
.

By
now
,
he
has
mostly
retired
from
the
Mafia
,
leaving
the
Corleone
family
's
criminal
interests
in
the
hands
of
enforcer
Joey
Zasa
(
Joe
Mantegna
)
,
and
is
using
his
tremendous
wealth
and
power
to
restore
his
reputation
via
numerous
acts
of
charity
.

Michael
and
Kay
(
Diane
Keaton
)
have
been
divorced
since
0000
,
and
Michael
gave
her
custody
of
their
children
,
Anthony
(
Franc
D'Ambrosio
)
and
Mary
(
Sofia
Coppola
)
.

At
a
ceremony
in
St.
Patrick
's
Old
Cathedral
,
Michael
is
named
a
Commander
of
the
Order
of
St.
Sebastian
.

At
a
party
following
the
ceremony
,
Anthony
tells
his
father
that
he
is
going
to
drop
out
of
law
school
to
pursue
a
career
as
an
opera
singer
.

Kay
supports
his
choice
,
but
Michael
disagrees
,
wishing
that
his
son
would
either
finish
law
school
or
join
the
family
business
,
but
Anthony
refuses
to
have
anything
to
do
with
his
father
's
"
legacy
"
.

Michael
and
Kay
have
an
uneasy
reunion
,
in
which
Kay
tells
him
that
Anthony
knows
the
truth
about
Fredo
's
death
.

Meanwhile
,
Vincent
Mancini
(
Andy
Garcia
)
,
the
illegitimate
son
of
Michael
's
late
brother
Sonny
,
shows
up
at
the
party
.

He
is
embroiled
in
a
feud
with
Zasa
,
who
has
involved
the
Corleone
family
in
major
drug
trafficking
and
turned
Little
Italy
into
a
slum
.

Michael
's
sister
Connie
(
Talia
Shire
)
arranges
a
"
sit-down
"
between
Vincent
and
Zasa
in
Michael
's
study
.

The
discussion
erupts
into
a
fight
,
in
which
Vincent
bites
Zasa
on
the
ear
.

That
night
Vincent
has
a
one-night
stand
with
a
journalist
named
Grace
Hamilton
(
Bridget
Fonda
)
.

Two
men
armed
with
knives
and
a
gun
break
in
and
try
to
kill
him
.

Vincent
kills
them
both
,
but
not
before
learning
that
Zasa
sent
them
.

Michael
is
troubled
by
Vincent
's
fiery
temper
,
but
is
nonetheless
impressed
by
his
loyalty
,
and
agrees
to
take
his
nephew
under
his
wing
.

Meanwhile
,
Michael
busies
himself
with
the
biggest
deal
of
his
career
:
He
has
recently
bought
up
enough
stock
in
International
Immobiliare
,
an
international
real
estate
holding
company
known
as
"
the
world
's
biggest
landlord
"
,
to
become
its
largest
single
shareholder
,
with
six
seats
on
the
company
's
00-member
board
of
directors
.

He
now
makes
a
tender
offer
to
buy
the
Vatican
's
00
%
interest
in
the
company
,
which
will
give
him
controlling
interest
.

Knowing
that
Archbishop
Gilday
(
Donal
Donnelly
)
,
who
serves
as
head
of
the
Vatican
Bank
,
has
run
up
a
massive
deficit
,
he
negotiates
a
deal
to
pay
$
000
million
to
the
Bank
in
exchange
for
the
shares
.

The
deal
is
quickly
approved
by
Immobiliare
's
board
.

However
,
it
must
be
ratified
in
Rome
by
Pope
Paul
VI
,
who
is
gravely
ill
.

Without
his
word
,
the
deal
is
in
limbo
.

Don
Altobello
(
Eli
Wallach
)
,
an
elderly
New
York
Mafia
boss
and
old
friend
of
the
Corleones
(
as
well
as
Connie
's
godfather
)
,
soon
visits
Michael
,
telling
him
that
his
old
partners
on
the
Commission
want
in
on
the
Immobiliare
deal
.

Michael
,
however
,
is
adamant
that
the
deal
shall
be
untainted
by
Mafia
involvement
.

A
meeting
is
arranged
,
and
Michael
appeases
most
of
the
Mafia
bosses
with
payoffs
from
the
sale
of
his
Las
Vegas
holdings
.

Zasa
,
however
,
gets
nothing
and
declares
that
Michael
is
his
enemy
and
storms
out
.

Altobello
tells
Michael
that
he
will
try
to
reason
with
Zasa
and
follows
close
behind
.

Minutes
later
,
a
helicopter
hovers
outside
the
conference
room
and
sprays
it
with
submachine
gun
fire
.

Most
of
the
other
mob
bosses
are
killed
,
but
Michael
,
Vincent
,
and
Michael
's
bodyguard
,
Al
Neri
(
Richard
Bright
)
,
escape
.

Back
at
his
penthouse
in
New
York
,
Vincent
tells
Michael
that
those
mob
bosses
who
escaped
the
massacre
made
deals
with
Zasa
.

Michael
knows
that
Zasa
was
not
the
mastermind
of
the
massacre
due
to
Zasa
's
being
"
muscle
"
and
not
having
the
cunning
to
organize
such
a
scheme
.

Vincent
wants
to
kill
Zasa
,
but
Michael
refuses
.

As
he
considers
how
to
respond
to
the
situation
,
he
suffers
a
diabetic
stroke
and
is
hospitalized
,
but
not
before
realizing
Altobello
is
the
traitor
.

As
Michael
recuperates
,
Vincent
begins
a
romantic
relationship
with
Mary
and
plots
revenge
against
Zasa
.

Neri
and
Connie
give
Vincent
permission
to
act
.

During
a
street
festival
hosted
by
Zasa
's
Italian
American
civil
rights
group
,
Vincent
's
men
gun
down
Zasa
's
bodyguards
.

Vincent
,
disguised
as
a
policeman
on
horseback
,
shoots
Zasa
dead
.

When
Michael
discovers
this
,
he
berates
Vincent
for
his
rashness
.

Michael
also
insists
that
Vincent
end
his
relationship
with
Mary
,
because
Vincent
's
involvement
in
the
family
's
criminal
enterprises
puts
her
life
in
jeopardy
.

The
family
takes
a
vacation
to
Sicily
in
preparation
for
Anthony
's
operatic
debut
in
Palermo
at
the
Teatro
Massimo
.

They
stay
at
the
villa
of
Corleone
family
friend
Don
Tommasino
(
Vittorio
Duse
)
.

Michael
tells
Vincent
to
speak
with
Altobello
and
tell
him
that
he
is
planning
to
leave
the
Corleone
family
.

Altobello
supports
the
idea
of
Vincent
's
switching
his
allegiance
,
and
introduces
him
to
Don
Licio
Lucchesi
(
Enzo
Robutti
)
,
a
powerful
Italian
political
figure
and
Immobiliare
's
chairman
.

Michael
realizes
that
the
Immobiliare
deal
is
an
elaborate
conspiracy
among
Lucchesi
,
Archbishop
Gilday
,
and
Vatican
accountant
Frederick
Keinszig
(
Helmut
Berger
)
to
swindle
him
out
of
his
money
,
and
visits
Cardinal
Lamberto
(
Raf
Vallone
)
,
the
man
favored
to
become
the
next
Pope
,
to
speak
about
the
deal
.

Lamberto
convinces
Michael
to
make
his
first
confession
in
00
years
,
in
which
he
tearfully
admits
to
ordering
Fredo
's
murder
.

Lamberto
tells
Michael
that
he
deserves
to
suffer
for
his
sins
,
but
that
his
life
could
still
be
redeemed
.

Shortly
after
the
meeting
between
Vincent
and
Lucchesi
,
Altobello
travels
to
the
small
village
of
Montelepre
,
where
he
hires
Mosca
(
Mario
Donatone
)
,
a
veteran
hitman
,
to
assassinate
Michael
.

A
few
days
later
,
Mosca
and
his
son
Lupe
,
disguised
as
priest
s
,
attempt
to
kidnap
Don
Tommasino
and
force
him
to
allow
them
entry
to
his
villa
.

Tommasino
refuses
,
and
Mosca
kills
him
.

While
touring
Sicily
with
Kay
,
who
has
arrived
for
Anthony
’s
operatic
debut
,
Michael
asks
for
her
forgiveness
.

As
they
both
admit
that
they
still
love
each
other
,
Michael
receives
word
that
Tommasino
is
dead
.

At
Tommassino
's
funeral
,
Michael
swears
over
his
old
friend
's
coffin
to
sin
no
more
.

After
the
death
of
Pope
Paul
VI
,
Cardinal
Lamberto
is
elected
Pope
John
Paul
I
,
which
means
that
the
Immobiliare
deal
will
likely
be
ratified
.

The
new
Pope
's
intentions
come
as
a
death
knell
to
the
plot
against
the
ratification
of
the
Immobiliare
deal
,
prompting
frantic
attempts
by
the
plotters
to
cover
their
own
tracks
.

Vincent
tells
Michael
that
he
has
learned
from
Altobello
of
Mosca
's
plot
on
his
life
.

Michael
sees
that
his
nephew
is
a
changed
man
,
and
makes
him
the
new
Don
of
the
Corleone
family
.

In
exchange
,
Vincent
agrees
to
put
an
end
to
his
relationship
with
Mary
.

The
family
travels
to
Palermo
to
see
Anthony
perform
the
lead
in
Pietro
Mascagni
's
Cavalleria
rusticana
,
a
tale
of
murderous
revenge
in
a
Sicilian
setting
.

Meanwhile
,
Vincent
exacts
his
own
revenge
:
The
killings
are
too
late
to
save
the
Pope
,
however
.

Just
hours
after
he
approves
the
Immobiliare
deal
,
the
Pope
drinks
poisoned
tea
provided
to
him
by
Archbishop
Gilday
and
soon
dies
in
his
bed
.

Mosca
,
still
disguised
as
a
priest
and
armed
with
a
sniper
rifle
,
descends
upon
the
opera
house
during
Anthony
's
performance
,
killing
three
of
Vincent
's
men
and
preparing
to
shoot
his
target
from
a
box
,
but
the
opera
ends
before
he
has
the
chance
to
pull
the
trigger
.

The
assassin
retreats
to
the
opera
house
façade
's
staircase
and
tries
to
shoot
Michael
there
.

At
the
same
moment
,
Mary
confronts
her
father
about
the
forced
break-up
with
Vincent
.

Mosca
fires
twice
,
wounding
Michael
and
accidentally
killing
Mary
.

Vincent
then
shoots
him
dead
.

As
Kay
and
Connie
weep
,
Michael
cradles
Mary
's
body
in
his
arms
and
screams
in
agony
.

The
scene
dissolves
to
a
short
montage
of
Michael
's
memories
of
all
the
women
he
has
lost
,
composed
of
scenes
with
Mary
,
Kay
,
and
his
first
wife
,
Apollonia
.

The
film
ends
with
Michael
,
an
old
man
,
sitting
in
the
garden
of
Don
Tommasino
's
Sicilian
villa
.

He
slumps
over
in
his
chair
,
falls
sideways
to
the
ground
,
and
dies
alone
,
with
only
his
dog
present
.

Cast
Pre-production
Coppola
felt
that
the
first
two
films
had
told
the
complete
Corleone
saga
.

In
his
audio
commentary
for
Part
II
,
he
stated
that
only
a
dire
financial
situation
caused
by
the
failure
of
New
York
Stories
compelled
him
to
take
up
Paramount
's
long-standing
offer
to
make
a
third
installment
.

According
to
an
article
in
Premiere
,
Coppola
and
Puzo
requested
six
months
to
complete
a
first
draft
of
the
script
with
a
release
date
of
Easter
0000
.

Paramount
agreed
to
give
them
six
weeks
for
the
script
and
,
lacking
a
holiday
movie
,
a
release
date
of
Christmas
Day
0000
.

Al
Pacino
,
Diane
Keaton
,
and
Talia
Shire
reprise
their
roles
from
the
first
two
films
.

According
to
Coppola
's
audio
commentary
on
the
film
in
The
Godfather
DVD
Collection
,
Robert
Duvall
refused
to
take
part
unless
he
was
paid
a
salary
comparable
to
Pacino
's
.

On
an
episode
of
Inside
the
Actors
Studio
,
Duvall
said
he
understood
that
Pacino
was
the
star
but
felt
insulted
by
the
difference
in
their
salaries
,
saying
"
if
they
paid
Pacino
twice
what
they
paid
me
,
that
's
fine
,
but
not
three
or
four
times
,
which
is
what
they
did
.
"

When
Duvall
dropped
out
,
Coppola
rewrote
the
screenplay
to
portray
Tom
Hagen
as
having
died
before
the
story
begins
.

Coppola
created
the
character
B.
J.
Harrison
,
played
by
George
Hamilton
,
to
replace
the
Hagen
character
in
the
story
.

The
director
further
states
that
,
to
him
,
the
movie
feels
incomplete
"
without
[
Robert
]
Duvall
's
participation
.
"

According
to
Coppola
,
had
Duvall
agreed
to
take
part
in
the
film
,
the
Hagen
character
would
have
been
heavily
involved
in
running
the
Corleone
charities
.

The
first
draft
of
a
script
had
been
written
by
Dean
Riesner
in
0000
,
based
on
a
story
by
Mario
Puzo
.

This
script
centered
around
Michael
Corleone
's
son
,
Anthony
,
a
naval
officer
working
for
the
CIA
,
and
the
Corleone
family
's
involvement
with
a
plot
to
assassinate
a
Central
America
n
dictator
.

Almost
none
of
the
elements
of
this
early
script
carried
over
to
the
final
film
,
but
one
scene
from
the
film
—
in
which
two
men
break
into
Vincent
's
house
—
exists
in
the
Riesner
draft
and
is
nearly
unchanged
.

Coppola
says
that
he
felt
The
Godfather
saga
was
essentially
Michael
's
story
,
one
about
how
"
a
good
man
becomes
evil
,
"
as
the
writer/director
puts
it
on
the
same
commentary
track
referenced
above
.

Coppola
says
he
felt
that
Michael
had
not
really
"
paid
for
his
sins
"
committed
in
the
second
film
,
and
wanted
this
final
chapter
to
demonstrate
that
.

In
keeping
with
this
theme
,
Coppola
completely
re-wrote
the
script
.

Julia
Roberts
was
originally
cast
as
Mary
,
but
dropped
out
due
to
scheduling
conflicts
.

Madonna
wanted
to
play
the
role
,
but
Coppola
felt
she
was
too
old
for
the
part
.

Rebecca
Schaeffer
was
set
to
audition
,
but
she
was
murdered
.

Winona
Ryder
dropped
out
of
the
film
at
the
last
minute
.

Ultimately
Sofia
Coppola
,
the
director
's
daughter
,
was
given
the
role
of
Michael
Corleone
's
daughter
.

Her
much-criticized
performance
resulted
in
her
father
being
accused
of
nepotism
,
a
charge
Coppola
denies
in
the
commentary
track
,
asserting
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
critics
,
"
beginning
with
an
article
in
Vanity
Fair
,
"
were
"
using
[
my
]
daughter
to
attack
me
,
"
something
he
finds
ironic
in
light
of
the
film
's
denouement
when
the
Mary
character
pays
the
ultimate
price
for
her
father
's
sins
.

As
an
infant
,
Sofia
Coppola
had
played
Michael
Corleone
's
infant
nephew
in
The
Godfather
,
during
the
climactic
baptism
/
murder
montage
at
the
end
of
that
film
.

(
Sofia
Coppola
also
appeared
in
The
Godfather
Part
II
,
as
a
small
immigrant
child
in
the
scene
where
the
nine-year-old
Vito
Corleone
arrives
by
steamer
at
Ellis
Island
.
)

The
character
of
Michael
's
sister
Connie
is
played
by
Francis
Ford
Coppola
's
sister
,
Talia
Shire
(
making
her
both
Mary
and
Sofia
's
aunt
)
.

Other
Coppola
relatives
with
cameos
in
the
film
included
his
mother
,
father
(
who
wrote
and
conducted
much
of
the
music
in
the
film
)
,
uncle
and
granddaughter
,
Gia
.

Michele
Russo
,
who
plays
the
son
of
the
assassin
Mosca
,
is
also
a
distant
Coppola
relative
,
from
the
same
town
as
Francis
Ford
Coppola
's
great-grandmother
.

In
addition
,
Coppola
cast
Catherine
Scorsese
,
mother
of
Martin
Scorsese
,
in
a
small
part
.

The
Godfather
Part
III
is
almost
unanimously
considered
to
be
the
weakest
of
the
three
Godfather
films
.

Common
criticisms
include
Sofia
Coppola
's
acting
,
the
plot
being
too
outlandish
and
convoluted
,
and
being
too
based
on
continuity
,
rather
than
just
a
"
stand
alone
"
story
.

In
his
review
,
Roger
Ebert
stated
that
it
is
"
not
even
possible
to
understand
this
film
without
knowing
the
first
two
.
"

Nonetheless
,
Ebert
wrote
an
enthusiastic
review
,
awarding
the
film
three-and-a-half
stars
,
a
better
rating
than
he
gave
The
Godfather
Part
II
.

He
also
defended
the
casting
of
Sofia
Coppola
,
who
he
felt
was
not
miscast
,
stating
,
"
There
is
no
way
to
predict
what
kind
of
performance
Francis
Ford
Coppola
might
have
obtained
from
Winona
Ryder
,
the
experienced
and
talented
young
actress
,
who
was
originally
set
to
play
this
role
.

But
I
think
Sofia
Coppola
brings
a
quality
of
her
own
to
Mary
Corleone
.

A
certain
up-front
vulnerability
and
simplicity
that
I
think
are
appropriate
and
right
for
the
role
.
"

Ebert
's
colleague
,
Gene
Siskel
,
also
highly
praised
the
film
and
placed
it
on
his
list
of
the
ten
best
films
of
0000
(
#
00
)
.

Siskel
admitted
that
the
ending
was
the
film
's
weakest
part
,
citing
Al
Pacino
's
makeup
as
very
poor
.

Leonard
Maltin
gave
the
movie
three
out
of
four
stars
and
stated
in
his
movie
guide
that
the
film
is
"
masterfully
told
"
,
but
the
casting
of
Sofia
Coppola
was
an
"
almost-fatal
flaw
"
.

recognition
:
The

was
also
nominated

,
but

.

Historical
background
Parts
of
the
film
are
very
loosely
based
on
real
historical
events
concerning
the
ending
of
the
papacy
of
Paul
VI
,
and
the
very
short
duration
of
John
Paul
I
in
0000
,
and
the
collapse
of
the
Banco
Ambrosiano
in
0000
.

Like
the
character
Cardinal
Lamberto
,
who
becomes
John
Paul
I
,
the
historical
John
Paul
I
,
Albino
Luciani
,
reigned
for
only
a
very
short
time
before
being
found
dead
in
his
bed
.

Journalist
David
Yallop
argues
that
Luciani
was
planning
a
reform
of
Vatican
finances
and
that
he
died
by
poisoning
;
these
claims
are
reflected
in
the
film
.

Yallop
also
names
as
a
suspect
Archbishop
Paul
Marcinkus
,
who
was
the
head
of
the
Vatican
bank
,
like
the
character
Archbishop
Gilday
in
the
film
.

However
,
while
Marcinkus
was
noted
for
his
muscular
physique
and
Chicago
origins
,
Gilday
is
a
mild
Irishman
.

The
character
has
also
drawn
comparisons
to
Cardinal
Giuseppe
Caprio
,
as
he
was
in
charge
of
the
Vatican
finances
during
the
approximate
period
of
which
the
movie
was
based
.

The
character
of
Frederick
Keinszig
,
the
Swiss
banker
who
is
murdered
and
left
hanging
under
a
bridge
,
mirrors
the
fate
(
and
physical
appearance
)
of
Roberto
Calvi
,
the
Italian
head
of
the
Banco
Ambrosiano
who
was
found
hanging
under
Blackfriars
Bridge
in
London
in
0000
(
it
was
unclear
whether
it
was
a
case
of
suicide
or
,
as
the
Italian
idiom
has
it
,
"
being
suicided
"
.

Courts
in
Italy
have
recently
ruled
the
latter
.
)

The
name
"
Keinszig
"
is
taken
from
Manuela
Kleinszig
,
the
girlfriend
of
Flavio
Carbone
who
was
indicted
as
one
of
Roberto
Calvi
's
murderers
in
0000
.

On
the
audio
commentary
of
the
DVD
,
Francis
Ford
Coppola
states
that
the
character
of
Don
Licio
Lucchesi
would
be
very
recognizable
for
Italian
citizens
.

The
thick-rimmed
glasses
,
the
official
police
bodyguard
while
Michael
meets
the
Don
in
Sicily
,
and
a
single
quote
at
the
end
of
the
movie
are
supposedly
clues
that
Don
Lucchesi
is
(
at
least
partly
)
based
on
Giulio
Andreotti
.

The
killing
of
Joey
Zasa
is
reminiscent
of
the
shooting
of
Joseph
Colombo
in
a
street
parade
.

Soundtrack
The
film
's
soundtrack
received
a
Golden
Globe
nomination
for
Best
Score
.

Also
,
the
film
's
love
theme
,
"
Promise
Me
You
'll
Remember
"
(
subtitled
"
Love
Theme
from
The
Godfather
Part
III
"
)
sung
by
Harry
Connick
,
Jr.
,
received
an
Oscar
and
Golden
Globe
nomination
for
Best
Song

Miamisburg
(
)
is
a
city
in
Montgomery
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Dayton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Miamisburg
is
known
for
its
large
industry
(
mainly
for
its
nuclear
operations
during
World
War
II
)
and
retail
factors
(
such
as
the
Dayton
Mall
)
commercial
business
area
,
which
is
partially
located
in
Miami
Township
,
but
is
probably
most
famous
for
being
the
home
to
the
Miamisburg
Mound
.

Miamisburg
borders
Miami
Township
,
Springboro
,
and
West
Carrollton
.

The
sister
city
of
Miamisburg
is
Owen
Sound
,
Ontario
.

History
European-Americans
started
calling
their
first
community
as
"
Hole
's
Station
"
since
about
0000
,
when
Zechariah
Hole
settled
there
with
his
family
from
Virginia
and
built
a
stockade
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Miami
River
opposite
the
mouth
of
Bear
Creek
.

The
stockade
attracted
squatters
,
surveying
parties
,
and
other
settlers
who
had
taken
grants
to
live
in
the
local
cabins
until
they
could
build
their
own
;
hence
the
little
community
became
known
as
"
Hole
's
Station
"
.

Settlers
came
west
primarily
from
Pennsylvania
.

By
0000
the
unincorporated
community
had
become
a
village
;
it
achieved
city
status
in
the
0000s
.

By
0000
,
the
Miami
and
Erie
Canal
was
under
construction
through
the
community
,
which
improved
transportation
of
people
and
goods
through
the
region
.

The
formal
opening
took
place
in
January
0000
,
when
the
Governor
Brown
was
the
first
packet
boat
to
go
through
the
settlement
.

Also
that
year
the
first
boats
from
Cincinnati
had
arrived
and
passed
through
Miamisburg
to
get
to
Dayton
.

By
0000
the
canal
had
been
extended
to
Piqua
,
and
many
businesses
along
the
river
grew
.

The
0000s
and
the
0000s
were
brought
the
best
of
times
to
the
canals
.

George
Kinder
,
a
local
resident
,
shipped
bags
of
food
to
Ireland
during
its
Great
Famine
;
these
also
contained
his
address
,
with
ads
saying
that
he
was
hiring
immigrant
workers
.

Some
Irish
immigrants
did
come
to
Miamisburg
and
surrounding
cities
in
search
of
work
.

But
by
the
early
00th
century
,
the
canal
was
abandoned
.

Later
highways
carried
most
of
the
local
traffic
.

Miamisburg
was
the
site
of
one
of
the
first
post-war
U.S
Atomic
Energy
Commission
(
AEC
)
facilities
,
beginning
in
0000
.

The
Dayton
area
had
supported
numerous
secret
operations
for
the
War
Department
during
World
War
II
.

As
the
war
ended
,
the
majority
of
these
operations
were
moved
to
the
Miamisburg
Mound
Laboratory
,
which
was
operated
by
the
Monsanto
Chemical
Company
.

The
Mound
Labs
were
to
monitor
all
aspects
of
the
US
nuclear
defense
stockpile
.

The
Mound
Plant
,
built
in
0000
,
was
situated
on
a
000
–
acre
site
in
the
city
south
of
Dayton
.

The
workers
,
who
numbered
more
than
0,000
at
the
height
of
the
production
,
made
plutonium
detonators
for
nuclear
weapons
.

Their
work
was
very
classified
.

The
plant
had
a
small
army
of
security
guards
and
was
ringed
by
chain-link
fencing
and
razor
wire
.

When
the
Cold
War
ended
,
the
plant
discontinued
the
detonator
work
,
but
it
continued
to
make
nuclear
power
generators
for
space
probes
.

In
May
0000
U.S
Department
of
Energy
decided
to
end
the
all
productions
at
the
Mound
.

This
move
affected
0,000
employees
in
the
local
area
.

By
0000
cleanup
of
radioactive
and
hazardous
waste
was
the
main
activity
at
the
Plant
.

The
Mound
Development
Corporation
spearheaded
the
creation
of
the
Mound
Advanced
Technology
Center
in
the
redevelopment
of
the
plant
,
with
the
Montgomery
County
Regional
Dispatch
Center
joining
00
other
tenants
in
March
0000
.

In
December
0000
,
the
Dayton
Police
Department
became
the
00th
law
enforcement
agency
,
along
with
00
fire
departments
,
to
be
dispatched
from
the
regional
center
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
00
cars
of
a
Conrail
freight
train
derailed
as
the
result
of
a
hot
box
,
caused
by
uneven
distribution
of
steel
ingots
in
a
gondola
loaded
at
Buffalo
,
New
York
by
Republic
Steel
.

They
demolished
a
house
at
the
Pearl
Street
crossing
and
killed
its
three
occupants
.

The
deaths
were
ruled
homicides
by
the
Montgomery
County
Coroner
.

Eight
years
later
,
on
July
0
,
0000
,
another
train
derailed
on
the
CSX
line
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Great
Miami
River
,
igniting
phosphorus
contained
in
some
of
the
tanker
cars
.

This
led
to
the
evacuation
of
approximately
00,000
people
across
southern
Montgomery
County
,
the
largest
evacuation
in
Ohio
history
.

The
resulting
thick
white
cloud
engulfed
communities
as
far
north
as
Yellow
Springs
,
Pitchin
,
and
South
Vienna
.

Rolling
in
like
a
massive
desert
dust
storm
across
the
horizon
,
the
chemical
cloud
hugged
the
ground
and
blotted
out
the
sun
for
several
minutes
before
dissipating
.

More
than
$
0
billion
in
lawsuits
resulted
.

A
nitric
oxide
distillation
column
at
a
local
chemical
plant
known
as
Isotec
exploded
on
September
00
,
0000
,
causing
school
and
other
events
to
be
cancelled
.

Isotec
is
a
division
of
Sigma-Aldrich
.

World

of
JatroDiesel

In

the

it
moved

,
but
the
operations
remain

to
be
opened

Miamisburg
Mound
Miamisburg
is
the
location
of
a
prehistoric
Indian
burial
mound
(
tumulus
)
,
believed
to
have
been
built
by
the
Adena
Culture
,
about
0000
to
000
BCE
.

Once
serving
as
an
ancient
burial
site
,
the
mound
has
become
perhaps
the
most
recognizable
historic
landmark
in
Miamisburg
.

It
is
the
largest
conical
burial
mound
in
Ohio
,
originally
nearly
00
feet
tall
(
the
height
of
a
seven-story
building
)
and
000
feet
in
circumference
;
it
remains
virtually
intact
from
its
construction
perhaps
0000
years
ago
.

Located
in
a
city
park
at
000
Mound
Avenue
,
it
has
been
designated
an
Ohio
historical
site
.

It
is
a
popular
attraction
and
picnic
destination
for
area
families
.

Visitors
can
climb
to
the
top
of
the
Mound
,
via
the
000
concrete
steps
built
into
its
side
.

It
is
located
at
coordinates
.

Climate
Miamisburg
and
its
surrounding
region
’s
climate
are
dominated
by
a
humid
continental
climate
,
characterized
by
hot
,
muggy
summers
and
cold
,
dry
winters
.

Miamisburg
is
prone
to
severe
weather
because
of
its
location
in
the
Midwestern
section
of
the
United
States
.

Tornadoes
are
possible
from
spring
to
fall
.

Floods
,
blizzards
,
and
severe
thunderstorms
can
also
occur
.

Miamisburg
has
suffered
some
natural
disasters
.

In
0000
,
a
tornado
struck
the
northwest
part
of
town
on
June
,
0th
,
allegedly
destroying
roofs
and
chimneys
,
and
uprooting
trees
.

It
also
destroyed
Linden
Avenue
Bridge
.

Blizzards
struck
the
town
in
0000
,
0000
,
and
0000
.

In
0000
the
Great
Dayton
Flood
destroyed
most
of
the
city
.

The
slightest
precipitation
has
a
direct
positive
correlation
to
the
flooding
of
locations
such
as
Rice
Field
,
which
is
on
the
banks
of
the
Great
Miami
River
.

City
architecture
Due
to
the
growth
of
the
city
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
many
houses
in
the
city
are
mainly
Victorian
-
style
homes
.

They
are
concentrated
in
“
Old
Miamisburg
”
(
downtown
and
riverfront
areas
)
.

Other
architectural
styles
include
Queen
Anne
,
Italianate
,
and
Second
Empire
-
styled
buildings
.

Much
of
Miami
Township
has
residential
housing
of
single-family
homes
,
which
were
built
during
the
expanded
suburban
development
of
the
0000s
through
0000s
.

Newer
houses
have
been
built
in
the
00st
century
as
some
residents
have
sought
higher-priced
luxury
homes
,
evidenced
in
new
developments
such
as
Pipestone
,
Crains
Run
,
Heincke
Woods
,
and
Bear
Creek
.

To
encourage
and
recognize
Miamisburg
citizens
for
maintaining
the
aesthetic
appearance
(
tidiness
,
landscaping
)
of
their

selects
a
number
of
"
