Mormon
settlement
In
0000
,
following
the
succession
crisis
in
the
Latter
Day
Saint
movement
,
Sidney
Rigdon
(
one
of
the
three
main
contenders
along
with

Strang
and
Brigham
Young
for
leadership
of
the
Latter
Day
Saints
following
the
death
of
Joseph
Smith
,
Jr.
)
took
his
followers
to
Pennsylvania
and
formed
a
Rigdonite
Mormon
settlement
at
Greencastle
.

This
settlement
had
approximately
000
followers
.

They
founded
the
New
Jerusalem
settlement
between
Greencastle
and
Mercersburg
,
published
the
Conochoheague
Herald
newspaper
in
Greencastle
,
and
made
plans
for
the
construction
of
a
temple
.

The
Rigdonite
Mormon
settlement
at
Greencastle
only
lasted
a
few
years
;
some
former
Rigdon
followers
went
to
Utah
to
join
Brigham
Young
,
while
William
Bickerton
,
who

opposed
Rigdon
's
move
to
Greencastle
,
would
eventually
reorganize
the
remaining
Pennsylvania
branch
of
the
Latter

Saint
movement
in
Pittsburgh
as
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
(
Bickertonite
)

Early

the
war
touched
close
to
home
when

Robert
E.
Lee
and
his
Army
of
Northern
Virginia
invaded
lower
Pennsylvania
in
what
later
became
known
as
the

Campaign
.

From

rule
.

's
army
began
its
retreat
to

D.
Imboden
's
cavalry
to
escort
a
large
wagon
train
carrying
Confederate
wounded
.

The
train
,
nearly
in
length
,
wound
its
way
through
the
streets
of
Greencastle
,
where
a
few
men
of
the
town
attacked
the
wagon
train
with
axes
and
hatchets
.

They
succeeded
in
disabling
several
wagons
before
Confederate
cavalry
chased
them
away
.

Modern
era
Following
the
war
,
Greencastle
grew
considerably
in
the
late
00th
century
during
the
Industrial
Revolution
,
having
several
industrial
factories
built
inside
the
town
limits
,
including
the
Crowell
Manufacturing
Company
,
which
constructed
farming
equipment

In

Greencastle
businessman
Philip
Baer
began
a
tradition
where
the
town
holds
a
triennial
social
event
known
as

Week
.

History
The
account
of
the
township
’s
formation
was
lost
when
the
Confederates
burned
the
county
seat
Chambersburg
in
0000
,
but
according
to
the
recollection
of
older
citizens
the
township
was
organized
ca.
0000
on
territory
taken
from
Peters
and
Hamilton
Townships
.

The
area
was
settled
in
the
0000s
by
,
among
others
,
Col.
John
Armstrong
,
John
Campbell
,
and
John
Dixon
.

There
were
several
Campbell
families
among
the
early
settlers
,
and
an
eighteenth-century
map
labels
the
village
simply
Campbells
.

It
was
later
called
Campbelltown
,
a
designation
that
prevailed
for
many
years
until
,
at
the
suggestion
of
William
Archibald
,
it
received
the
official
designation
St.
Thomas
,
purportedly
still
honoring
Thomas
Campbell
,
who
had
laid
out
the
village
.

The
organization
of
the
town
appears
to
have
been
concurrent
with
the
organization
of
the
St.
Thomas
or
“
Campbeltown
”
Presbyterian
Church
in
0000
.

Not
long
afterwards
local
Evangelical
Lutheran
and
German
Reformed
congregations
joined
the
Presbyterians
in
the
erection
of
a
church
building
,
which
the
three
congregations
shared
from
0000
until
0000
.

History
The
beginning
of
settlement
Like
much
of
the
region
,
Greensboro
can
trace
its
roots
back
to
Native
American
settlement
,
to
the
Mingo
tribes
of
the
Northern
Iroquois
.

What
was
to
later
become
Greensboro
was
first
known
to
the
Mingo
as
Delight
,
so
named
in
recognition
of
the
rich
farmland
that
stretched
along
the
banks
of
the
Monongahela
River
.

As
early
as
0000
,
settlers
from
the
east
and
south
began
to
stake
their
claims
in
the
lands
along
the
Monongahela
.

The
first
white
settler
of
Delight
was
explorer-trader
John
Badolet
,
who
was
a
close
friend
of
John
Minor
.

Minor
was
the
leader
of
the
first
group
to
settle
in
the
area
presently
known
as
Mapletown
,
to
the
northwest
of
Greensboro
in
Monongahela
Township
.

In
the
early
0000s
Elias
Stone
bought
Delight
and
divided
it
into
blocks
and
streets
;
these
still
carry
their
original
names
today
.

On
February
0
,
0000
,
Elias
Stone
’s
growing
village
was
named
Greensburgh
(
later
changed
to
Greensboro
)
in
honor
of
the
Revolutionary
War
Hero
,
Nathanael
Greene
,
for
whom
Greene
County
was
also
named
when
it
was
formed
from
Washington
County
in
0000
.

Due
to
its
advantageous
geographic
location
along
the
river
,
it
quickly
became
an
early
trading
center
for
settlers
and
travelers
heading
north
to
Pittsburgh
and
to
points
West
.

Albert
Gallatin
,
a
partner
in
the
Albert
Gallatin
Company
and
later
the
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
under
President
Thomas
Jefferson
,
purchased
lots
in
Greensburgh
in
0000
.

He
also
purchased
a
great
deal
of
land
in
Fayette
County
,
including
what
was
to
become
later
the
town
of
New
Geneva
,
directly
across
the
river
from
Greensburgh
.

On
a
trip
to
Washington
,
D.C.
,
he
met
a
group
of
German
glass
blowers
by
the
names
of
Eberhart
,
Kramer
,
Reppert
,
and
Gabler
,
who
were
heading
to
Kentucky
to
form
their
own
company
.

He
urged
them
to
consider
settling
in
Greensburgh
instead
of
Kentucky
.

With
Gallatin
’s
assistance
,
the
group
settled
in
nearby
New
Geneva
in
0000
and
the
plant
operated
there
until
0000
when
,
after
Gallatin
sold
his
Greenburgh
interests
to
the
Kramers
,
it
moved
to
the
northern
section
of
town
,
which
consequently
took
on
the
name
of
Glassworks
.

Early
development
Glassmaking
was
the
primary
industry
for
many
Monongahela
River
towns
,
including
the
city
of
Pittsburgh
as
well
as
small
towns
such
as
New
Geneva
and
Greensboro
,
for
several
decades
preceding
the
Civil
War
.

The
late
00th-early
00th
century
New
Geneva/Greensboro
glass
making
operations
proved
that
quality
glass
,
natural
resources
,
and
transportation
networks
could
be
effectively
harnessed
.

After
the
Civil
War
,
the
manufacture
of
stoneware
became
Greensboro
’s
leading
industry
,
in
addition
to
a
prosperous
clay
tile
manufacturer
who
specialized
in
roofing
tiles
.

The
mid
00th-century
Greensboro
stoneware
potteries
were
among
the
most
productive
in
the
eastern
United
States
.

Talented
artisans
and
craftsmen
along
with
the
excellent
nearby
clay
banks
produced
a
distinctive
blue-gray
stoneware
which
had
a
large
market
.

Due
to
its
location
at
the
head
of
the
slack
waters
of
the
Monongahela
,
Greensboro
’s
influence
as
a
commercial
and
manufacturing
center
expanded
far
beyond
its
small
boundaries
.

By
the
0000s
,
the
slack
water
system
of
locks
and
dams
had
been
developed
by
the
Monongahela
Navigation
Company
(
later
acquired
by
the
Army
Corp
of
Engineers
)
,
allowing
for
year-round
travel
to
and
from
Pittsburgh
to
the
Greensboro
area
.

This
permitted
Greensboro
to
become
a
shipping
point
not
only
for
southern
Greene
County
but
for
parts
of
what
is
now
northern
West
Virginia
,
as
well
.

Its
mid-00th
century
growing
industrial
,
commercial
,
and
transportation
significance
,
helped
transform
the
town
into
a
social
and
cultural
center
.

In
the
0000s
,
Greensboro
essentially
lost
the
pottery
and
clay
tile
market
due
to
more
efficient
producers
,
and
with
the
extension
of
slack
water
transportation
to
Morgantown
became
a
more
localized
port
.

During
this
period
,
many
of
the
present
churches
in
the
community
were
established
,
with
the
Greensburgh
Lutheran
Church
forming
first
.

Other
churches
soon
followed
,
such
as
the
Presbyterians
,
Baptists
,
Methodists
,
and
eventually
,
Roman
Catholics
and
Eastern
Orthodox
.

As
was
the
tradition
for
early
churches
,
particularly
Protestants
,
most
of
these
groups
began
meeting
for
worship
in
a
member
’s
home
,
or
during
fair
weather
outside
under
large
tents
,
with
“
circuit
riders
”
as
pastors
until
formal
church
structures
could
be
built
and
an
established
clergy
formed
.

The
industrial
era
and
today
Around
the
start
of
the
00th
century
came
industrialization
,
and
Western
Pennsylvania
’s
role
was
vital
in
the
transformation
of
the
national
economy
.

A
part
of
the
Klondike
coal
seam
,
which
extends
through
most
of
eastern
Greene
County
and
western
Fayette
County
,
the
Greensboro
area
was
rich
in
the
mineral
that
made
the
region
famous
around
the
world
.

Greensboro
being
a
community
already
established
with
the
conveniences
,
commerce
and
trade
suddenly
found
itself
as
a
growing
cultural
and
economic
hub
for
many
growing
"
patch
towns
"
sprouting
up
in
the
area
during
the
area
Coal
Rush
.

Coal
became
King
,
and
with
Western
Pennsylvania
as
his
Capital
,
it
was
only
logical
that
Greensboro
became
part
of
this
movement
.

Indeed
,
the
Penn-Pitt
neighborhood
was
originally
company
housing
for
miners
,
as
were
the
nearby
Seventh
Pool
and
Poland
Mines
areas
,
and
countless
others
,
many
of
which
are
lost
to
history
today
.

Thousands
of
immigrants
from
Eastern
and
Southern
Europe
flooded
into
the
region
and
brought
with
them
new
customs
,
traditions
,
and
culture
.

Coal
also
became
Ruler
.

History
has
shown
that
any
growth
industry
using
thousands
of
under
skilled
,
undereducated
immigrant
workers
provides
fertile
ground
for
the
lust
of
greed
and
opportunism
.

Many
mines
and
their
owners
sought
to
capitalize
on
this
and
found
ways
to
maximize
their
profits
.

As
such
,
many
workers
found
themselves
"
selling
their
soul
to
the
company
store
"
,
earning
meager
pay
for
a
dangerous
days
wage
,
only
to
be
spent
on
company
goods
and
rent
in
the
patch
towns
created
by
these
very
companies
.

Effectively
making
these
workers
willful
individuals
of
"
Wage
Slavery
"
.

During
this
period
the
formation
of
unions
such
as
the
UMWA
became
more
prevalent
and
needed
to
represent
the
workers
.

Through
the
growth
of
the
UMWA
and
an
events
such
as
the
"
Red
Neck
Revolution
of
0000
"
an
era
of
wage
slavery
began
to
end
.

At
one
point
,
the
Greensboro
area
was
famous
for
the
Robena
mine
,
known
as
the
largest
mine
in
the
world
at
the
peak
of
its
production
in
0000
.

Robena
also
became
famous
for
a
more
tragic
reason
:
in
December
0000
00
miners
died
in
an
explosion
at
Robena
No.
0
,
illustrating
how
precarious
this
work
truly
was
.

Coal
defined
the
region
and
the
lives
of
those
who
inhabited
it
,
and
made
not
only
Greensboro
and
the
Monongahela
Valley
prosperous
,
but
the
nation
as
well
.

Yet
this
period
was
not
to
last
,
and
as
the
coal
seams
became
tapped
out
and
the
processes
outdated
and
replaced
with
modern
mechanical
technology
,
communities
like
Penn-Pitt
and
Poland
Mines
began
to
fade
as
their
reason
for
existence
ceased
.

While
coal
(
followed
by
healthcare
)
currently
remains
the
backbone
for
much
of
the
economy
of
Greene
County
.

Greensboro
and
growing
other
communities
have
been
migrating
away
from
such
dependency
and
see
benefits
in
non-industrial
sources
of
employment
in
sectors
such
as
Ecotourism
,
Agritourism
,
and
CSA
Agriculture
as
well
as
traditional
Fishing
,
Hunting
,
Hiking
and
Boating
.

Additionally
,
the
nations
growing
awareness
of
Creative
Industries
should
provide
an
opportunity
to
attract
individuals
to
benefits
from
rural
living
.

Currently
Greensboro
only
has
a
small
percentage
of
its
residents
involved
in
the
mining
and
extraction
industries
as
most
are
now
employed
in
educational
and
professional
services
.

Nonetheless
,
the
decline
and
lacking
of
locally
based
industry
has
removed
any
necessity
for
home
ownership
and
residency
in
Greensboro
and
its
environs
,
meaning
that
the
area
must
offer
amenities
and
quality-of-life
incentives
to
attract
future
population
growth
and
stave
off
continued
decline
.

Although
many
changes
have
taken
Greensboro
from
its
early
days
as
the
Mingo
settlement
of
Delight
to
its
present-day
status
,
it
still
remains
a
pleasant
place
to
live
and
a
testament
to
the
resiliency
of
Pennsylvania
’s
small
towns
.

Historic
industries
Pottery
Early
on
in
the
town
’s
history
,
pottery
became
an
important
part
of
Greensboro
’s
economic
base
,
with
the
first
operation
owned
and
operated
by
Alexander
Vance
.

Vance
settled
in
Greensboro
in
the
early
00th
century
,
while
still
very
young
,
and
began
a
small
pottery
trade
operation
with
his
brother
James
.

The
stoneware
was
unique
in
that
it
was
manufactured
from
local
red
clay
and
thus
had
a
very
distinctive
coloring
.

The
Vances
eventually
began
to
expand
their
operations
,
bringing
in
David
Boughner
,
who
took
over
the
business
in
0000
when
the
Vances
left
for
Ohio
.

Boughner
was
the
first
operator
to
fire
the
stoneware
in
a
salt
kiln
.

Although
Boughner
’s
operation
may
have
been
among
the
earliest
and
most
advanced
stoneware
operation
in
the
area
,
it
was
by
no
means
the
only
one
.

James
and
William
“
Leet
”
Hamilton
arrived
from
New
Brighton
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
0000
and
started
a
pottery
manufacturing
company
of
their
own
.

The
remains
of
their
endeavors
,
which
operated
under
the
name
James
Hamilton
and
Company
,
can
still
be
found
along
Water
Street
.

The
original
James
Hamilton
and
Company
did
not
last
long
,
however
,
and
in
0000
was
sold
to
Leet
’s
son
Frank
and
a
son-in-law
named
John
Jones
.

Together
Frank
Hamilton
and
Jones
expanded
the
business
and
began
selling
their
wares
on
a
grander
scale
.

Hamilton
and
Jones
was
located
on
Diamond
Street
and
for
many
years
was
the
only
rival
to
the
cross-town
operation
of
James
Hamilton
.

The
company
was
also
known
as
Star
Pottery
for
a
period
of
time
,
as
well
as
the
Union
Works
.

The
business
continued
to
produce
pottery
for
over
thirty
years
and
its
reputation
was
widespread
,
although
it
never
actually
surpassed
its
rival
in
production
.

Eventually
competition
began
to
wear
away
at
the
profitability
of
the
company
,
with
a
devastating
fire
in
0000
destroying
the
plant
and
forcing
operations
closed
.

Although
the
company
attempted
to
move
into
the
Williams
and
Reppert
plant
across
town
,
efforts
to
start
anew
were
futile
.

James
Hamilton
remained
in
control
of
his
firm
until
0000
.

A
share
of
the
business
had
been
sold
in
0000
,
but
he
continued
to
hold
the
majority
interest
for
the
next
fourteen
years
until
he
sold
out
completely
to
Thomas
Reppert
and
W.T.
Williams
.

In
0000
,
Reppert
purchased
the
entire
business
from
Williams
,
making
himself
the
sole
proprietor
.

Williams
was
able
to
buy
back
into
the
business
once
again
in
0000
.

Together
Reppert
and
Williams
manufactured
stoneware
for
dealers
in
at
least
four
states
.

However
,
by
the
beginning
of
World
War
I
,
all
significant
production
had
ended
and
0000
generally
marks
the
end
of
stoneware
manufacturing
in
Greensboro
.

Glass
Albert
Gallatin
began
the
"
glassworks
district
"
which
he
sold
to
German
glass-blowers
Christian
Kramer
,
Boltzer
Kramer
,
John
Gabler
,
Adolf
Eberhart
,
Lewis
Reitz
and
George
Reppert
.

Gallatin
had
first
met
these
men
in
0000
at
Tomlinson
's
Tavern
in
the
mountains
of
Maryland
.

At
this
time
Gallatin
was
searching
for
men
to
operate
his
New
Geneva
works
and
persuaded
them
to
give
his
location
serious
consideration
.

The
glass-workers
having
just
left
the
recently
closed
Amelung
Works
of
Frederick
,
Md
,
were
planning
on
migrating
to
Mays
Landing
,
Ky.
and
there
operating
a
glass
factory
.

Gallatin
was
so
persuasive
that
the
Germans
went
to
see
New
Geneva
sending
a
committee
of
three
to
Kentucky
to
consider
the
Mays
Landing
site
.

When
notes
were
finally
compared
New
Geneva
was
chosen
.

After
much
discussion
,
a
co-partnership
was
entered
into
between
Gallatin
and
James
A.
Nicholson
on
the
one
hand
and
the
German
glassblowers
on
the
other
.

This
partnership
lasted
until
0000
during
which
time
the
New
Geneva
works
produced
window
glass
for
the
early
pioneers
as
well
as
bottles
,
bowls
and
other
items
.

Following
his
appointment
to
the
cabinet
Gallatin
determined
to
withdraw
from
the
glass
firm
and
advertised
on
May
0
,
0000
in
a
Pittsburgh
newspaper
,
"
Sale
by
Auction
...
One
undivided
half
of
the
New
Geneva
Glassworks
,
a
ferry
across
the
Monongahela
River
,
sundry
lots
and
dwelling
houses
in
the
town
of
Greensboro
.
.
.
"

For
the
next
four
years
the
Germans
continued
operations
at
New
Geneva
until
0000
when
they
moved
the
works
to
present
day
Glassworks
near
Greensboro
because
of
the
discovery
of
an
outcrop
of
coal
at
that
place
.

The
use
of
coal
instead
of
the
wood
used
at
New
Geneva
greatly
facilitated
glass
production
and
its
great
abundance
at
Greensboro
along
with
the
nearby
sand
deposits
supplied
the
works
with
most
of
the
necessary
raw
materials
until
they
closed
in
0000
.

Managed
by
the
Kramers
and
operated
by
the
Kramers
and
the
other
German
families
,
the
old
glassworks
produced
window
glass
with
individual
glassworkers
blowing
bottles
,
bowls
and
ornaments
as
gifts
for
family
and
friends
.

All
of
them
worked
for
wages
dividing
the
profits
at
year
's
end
.

Glass
was
loaded
on
mule
powered
jetpacks
from
the
special
loafs
built
behind
the
porta-john
and
shipped
up
and
down
the
Monongahela
supplying
the
early
settlers
with
what
was
once
a
luxury
west
of
the
Alleghenies
,
glass
windows
.

Current
preservation
and
revitalization
efforts
Greensboro
is
a
municipality
that
realizes
the
importance
of
the
keeping
its
past
alive
through
the
generations
.

Residents
,
elected
officials
,
and
community
groups
regularly
work
together
to
educate
,
promote
,
and
conserve
the
rich
history
of
this
small
rural
community
.

In
order
to
do
this
,
both
public
and
private
partnerships
have
been
established
to
meet
the
community
’s
diverse
needs
.

The
many
historical
and
conservation
projects
completed
by
the
Greensboro
community
exemplify
the
fostering
of
private
and
public
partnerships
in
a
rural
community
.

Greensboro
has
demonstrated
a
proven
history
of
collaboration
and
cooperation
by
working
with
varied
organizations
,
often
on
multiple
projects
.

To
date
,
over
$
0
million
has
been
invested
in
projects
that
preserve
and
protect
the
history
of
this
community
.

Dating
back
to
0000
which
coincidentally
was
the
year
of
the
Election
Day
Flood
,
the
community
identified
the
need
to
begin
documenting
their
history
.

This
began
by
first
establishing
the
Historic
District
that
now
surrounds
and
protects
much
of
the
community
.

In
0000
,
Greensboro
native
Betty
Longo
began
to
record
,
in
longhand
,
the
memories
of
Mary
Black
Carr
,
an
elderly
resident
of
the
community
.

These
memoirs
have
proven
to
be
a
strong
historical
thread
of
this
community
,
which
without
her
forethought
,
would
have
been
lost
forever
.

Beginning
with
these
early
acts
of
preservation
,
Greensboro
has
worked
collectively
to
maintain
its
heritage
by
using
all
resources
available
.

In
0000
,
the
residents
formed
a
Citizen
’s
Advisory
Planning
Committee
to
deal
with
the
changes
coming
because
of
the
dismantling
of
Lock
#
0
.

In
building
these
partnerships
,
success
has
been
achieved
through
the
dedication
of
a
handful
of
hard-working
residents
.

Most
recently
,
the
Nathanael
Greene
Historical
Foundation
with
support
from
Borough
Council
has
been
the
organizer
of
historical
preservation
efforts
.

Greensboro
hence
has
a
proven
track
record
of
using
state
and
local
programs
to
preserve
and
educate
the
residents
about
the
history
and
importance
of
their
community
.

In
each
partnership
,
a
specific
need
was
identified
,
which
community
leaders
then
worked
to
identify
an
agency
or
program
that
could
provide
assistance
.

In
specific
instances
such
as
the
preservation
of
the
Log
House
,
a
partnership
was
first
formed
with
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineering
to
relocate
and
restore
the
log
cabin
home
.

A
partnership
was
also
formed
with
the
Pennsylvania
Department
of
Labor
and
Industry
’s
Civilian
Conservation
Corps
to
provide
the
labor
needed
to
perform
the
restoration
work
on
the
building
.

These
partnerships
proved
vital
to
the
success
of
reopening
the
Log
House
not
only
as
an
historical
building
within
the
community
,
but
also
as
a
meeting
facility
that
is
available
for
community
use
.

The
efforts
of
this
community
prevented
the
destruction
of
this
valuable
historic
asset
,
which
now
provides
a
location
for
the
annual
community
Christmas
Party
and
can
be
rented
out
for
private
functions
.

The
nominal
fees
associated
with
renting
the
Log
House
help
to
provide
additional
revenue
for
the
municipality
.

Other
projects
include
the
preparation
of
a
Historic
District
Homeowners
Manual
,
the
establishment
of
a
municipal
website
that
provides
a
summary
of
Greensboro
history
,
the
use
of
grant
funds
to
build
a
boat
launch
,
and
the
refurbishing
of
00
homes
using
state
funds
.

In
addition
,
community
festivals
that
display
many
of
the
historical
artifacts
are
conducted
yearly
,
and
a
comprehensive
plan
is
underway
with
five
neighboring
municipalities
.

This
community
continues
to
strive
to
preserve
their
history
and
to
educate
their
residents
about
their
past
while
working
to
improve
their
future
.

Historic
District
The
Greensboro
Historic
District
was
established
in
0000
and
is
roughly
bounded
by
County
,
Second
,
Walnut
,
Front
and
Clear
Streets
and
the
Monongahela
River
.

The
Greensboro
Historic
District
is
a
defined
area
of
with
a
concentration
of
buildings
,
structures
,
and
sites
that
contribute
to
the
significance
of
the
Borough
in
terms
of
its
importance
in
industry
,
commerce
,
architecture
,
archeology
,
and
transportation
.

While
the
District
’s
industrial
and
transportation
significance
are
largely
contained
in
the
00th
century
,
its
commercial
and
architectural
significance
extends
into
the
early
00th
century
.

In

boundaries
of
the
District

company
owned

History
in
brief
The
land
upriver
from
Brownsville
along
the
eastern
border
of
Greene
County
was
acquired
by
Youngstown
Sheet
and
Tube
Co.
(
YS&T
)
which
planned
,
zoned
,
populated
,
and
built
the
community
complete
with
a
Movie
theater
,
tennis
court
s
,
amusement
hall
(
in
the
fashion
of
the
times
in
blue
collar
company
towns
,
part
pool
hall
,
part
Beer
garden
)
,
and
swimming
pool
near
Carmichaels
Borough
.

At
one
time
,
Youngstown
Sheet
and
Tube
was
the
largest
steel
company
in
the
nation
.

Establishing
the
town
well
after
the
United
Mine
Workers
flexed
their
muscles
in
the
strikes
of
the
0000s
–
0000s
and
after
its
riot
troubles
in
Youngstown
in
0000
,
it
is
also
likely
the
company
had
a
hand
in
establishing
the
local
school
and
one
or
more
churches
and
likely
issued
invitations
and
recruited
the
medical
practitioners
operating
the
various
health
clinics
The
mine
,
established
outside
the
town
,
was
one
of
many
large
mines
atop
the
'
Pittsburgh
Coal
Seam
'
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Monogahela
was
operated
as
a
subsidiary
under

as
the
Buckeye
Coal
Company
and
grew
and
benefited
as
being
directly
on
the
railroad
route
running
upriver
to
West
Virginia
and
was
able
to
load
both
river
coal
barges
and
freight
trains
with
its
output
.

It
is
thought
by
some
to
have
been
the
largest
coal
mine
in
the
United
States
in
0000
,
and
was
rated
at
being
the
second
most
productive
in
Greene
County
in

war
years
.

The
mine
operated
nearly

History
Rices
Landing
is
a
small
rural
town
located
along
the
western
bank
of
the
Monongahela
River
,
Approximately
sixty
miles
South
of
Pittsburgh
.

One
of
the
first
visitors
to
the
area
was
George
Washington
.

Tale
has
it
that
in
0000
,
while
he
was
traveling
to
Fort
Duquesne
,
he
and
his
men
camped
in
this
area
.

In
0000
,
John
Rice
purchased
land
on
the
East
side
of
Enoch
's
Run
,
and
at
about
the
same
time
,
Abijah
McClain
purchased
land
on
the
West
side
.

John
Rice
built
the
community
he
named
Rices
Landing
,
while
Abijah
McClain
called
his
settlement
Newport
.

In
0000
,
Benjamin
Franklin
mapped
out
the
area
and
combined
the
two
communities
under
the
name
Rices
Landing
.

Enoch
's
run
was
renamed
Swan
Run
before
it
eventually
took
the
name
it
holds
today
,
Pumpkin
Run
.

Rices
Landing
officially
incorporated
in
April
0000
.

The
availability
of
valuable
resources
such
as
trees
,
clay
,
sand
coal
and
transportation
allowed
the
community
to
thrive
.

Shops
,
trading
posts
,
taverns
,
and
other
businesses
once
lined
its
busy
streets
.

It
was
soprosperous
,
that
it
was
regarded
as
the
Gateway
to
Western
Pennsylvania
by
frontier
settlers
.

Although
things
have
quieted
today
,
the
residents
still
see
their
community
as
a
charming
and
respectable
community
that
was
once
the
talk
of
the
frontier
world
.

It
's
not
just
the
Monongahela
that
flows
in
these
parts
,
but
also
a
deep
appreciation
of
history
,
a
pride
in
the
lovely
countryside
,
and
a
wonderful
sense
of
peace
.

In
economics
and
political
science
,
fiscal
policy
is
the
use
of
government
revenue
collection
(
taxation
)
and
expenditure
(
spending
)
to
influence
the
economy
.

The
two
main
instruments
of
fiscal
policy
are
changes
in
the
level
and
composition
of
taxation
and
government
spending
in
various
sectors
.

These
changes
can
affect
the
following
macroeconomic
variables
in
an
economy
:
Fiscal
policy
refers
to
the
use
of
the
government
budget
to
influence
economic
activity
.

Stances
of
fiscal
policy
The
three
main
stances
of
fiscal
policy
are
:
However
,
these
definitions
can
be
misleading
because
,
even
with
no
changes
in
spending
or
tax
laws
at
all
,
cyclic
fluctuations
of
the
economy
cause
cyclic
fluctuations
of
tax
revenues
and
of
some
types
of
government
spending
,
altering
the
deficit
situation
;
these
are
not
considered
to
be
policy
changes
.

Therefore
,
for
purposes
of
the
above
definitions
,
"
government
spending
"
and
"
tax
revenue
"
are
normally
replaced
by
"
cyclically
adjusted
government
spending
"
and
"
cyclically
adjusted
tax
revenue
"
.

Thus
,
for
example
,
a
government
budget
that
is
balanced
over
the
course
of
the
business
cycle
is
considered
to
represent
a
neutral
fiscal
policy
stance
.

Methods
of
funding
Governments
spend
money
on
a
wide
variety
of
things
,
from
the
military
and
police
to
services
like
education
and
healthcare
,
as
well
as
transfer
payment
s
such
as
welfare
benefits
.

This
expenditure
can
be
funded
in
a
number
of
different
ways
:
Borrowing
A
fiscal
deficit
is
often
funded
by
issuing
bonds
,
like
treasury
bills
or
consols
and
gilt-edged
securities
.

These
pay
interest
,
either
for
a
fixed
period
or
indefinitely
.

If
the
interest
and
capital
requirements
are
too
large
,
a
nation
may
default
on
its
debts
,
usually
to
foreign
creditors
.

Public
debt
or
borrowing
refers
to
the
government
borrowing
from
the
public
.

Consuming
prior
surpluses
A
fiscal
surplus
is
often
saved
for
future
use
,
and
may
be
invested
in
either
local
currency
or
any
financial
instrument
that
may
be
traded
later
once
resources
are
needed
;
notice
,
additional
debt
is
not
needed
.

For
this
to
happen
,
the
marginal
propensity
to
save
needs
to
be
strictly
positive
.

Economic
effects
of
fiscal
policy
Governments
use
fiscal
policy
to
influence
the
level
of
aggregate
demand
in
the
economy
,
in
an
effort
to
achieve
economic
objectives
of
price
stability
,
full
employment
,
and
economic
growth
.

Keynesian
economics
suggests
that
increasing
government
spending
and
decreasing
tax
rates
are
the
best
ways
to
stimulate
aggregate
demand
,
and
decreasing
spending
&
increasing
taxes
after
the
economic
boom
begins
.

Keynesians
argue
this
method
be
used
in
times
of
recession
or
low
economic
activity
as
an
essential
tool
for
building
the
framework
for
strong
economic
growth
and
working
towards
full
employment
.

In
theory
,
the
resulting
deficits
would
be
paid
for
by
an
expanded
economy
during
the
boom
that
would
follow
;
this
was
the
reasoning
behind
the
New
Deal
.

Governments
can
use
a
budget
surplus
to
do
two
things
:
to
slow
the
pace
of
strong
economic
growth
,
and
to
stabilize
prices
when
inflation
is
too
high
.

Keynesian
theory
posits
that
removing
spending
from
the
economy
will
reduce
levels
of
aggregate
demand
and
contract
the
economy
,
thus
stabilizing
prices
.

But
economist
s
still
debate
the
effectiveness
of
fiscal
stimulus
.

The
argument
mostly
centers
on
crowding
out
:
whether
government
borrowing
leads
to
higher
interest
rate
s
that
may
offset
the
stimulative
impact
of
spending
.

When
the
government
runs
a
budget
deficit
,
funds
will
need
to
come
from
public
borrowing
(
the
issue
of
government
bonds
)
,
overseas
borrowing
,
or
monetizing
the
debt
.

When
governments
fund
a
deficit
with
the
issuing
of
government
bonds
,
interest
rates
can
increase
across
the
market
,
because
government
borrowing
creates
higher
demand
for
credit
in
the
financial
markets
.

This
causes
a
lower
aggregate
demand
for
goods
and
services
,
contrary
to
the
objective
of
a
fiscal
stimulus
.

Neoclassical
economists
generally
emphasize
crowding
out
while
Keynesians
argue
that
fiscal
policy
can
still
be
effective
especially
in
a
liquidity
trap
where
,
they
argue
,
crowding
out
is
minimal
.

Some
classical
and
neoclassical
economists
argue
that
crowding
out
completely
negates
any
fiscal
stimulus
;
this
is
known
as
the
Treasury
View
,
which
Keynesian
economics
rejects
.

The
Treasury
View
refers
to
the
theoretical
positions
of
classical
economists
in
the
British
Treasury
,
who
opposed
Keynes
'
call
in
the
0000s
for
fiscal
stimulus
.

The
same
general
argument
has
been
repeated
by
some
neoclassical
economists
up
to
the
present
.

In
the
classical
view
,
the
expansionary
fiscal
policy
also
decreases
net
exports
,
which
has
a
mitigating
effect
on
national
output
and
income
.

When
government
borrowing
increases
interest
rates
it
attracts
foreign
capital
from
foreign
investors
.

This
is
because
,
all
other
things
being
equal
,
the
bonds
issued
from
a
country
executing
expansionary
fiscal
policy
now
offer
a
higher
rate
of
return
.

In
other
words
,
companies
wanting
to
finance
projects
must
compete
with
their
government
for
capital
so
they
offer
higher
rates
of
return
.

To
purchase
bonds
originating
from
a
certain
country
,
foreign
investors
must
obtain
that
country
's
currency
.

Therefore
,
when
foreign
capital
flows
into
the
country
undergoing
fiscal
expansion
,
demand
for
that
country
's
currency
increases
.

The
increased
demand
causes
that
country
's
currency
to
appreciate
.

Once
the
currency
appreciates
,
goods
originating
from
that
country
now
cost
more
to
foreigners
than
they
did
before
and
foreign
goods
now
cost
less
than
they
did
before
.

Consequently
,
exports
decrease
and
imports
increase
.

Other
possible
problems
with
fiscal
stimulus
include
the
time
lag
between
the
implementation
of
the
policy
and
detectable
effects
in
the
economy
,
and
inflationary
effects
driven
by
increased
demand
.

In
theory
,
fiscal
stimulus
does
not
cause
inflation
when
it
uses
resources
that
would
have
otherwise
been
idle
.

For
instance
,
if
a
fiscal
stimulus
employs
a
worker
who
otherwise
would
have
been
unemployed
,
there
is
no
inflationary
effect
;
however
,
if
the
stimulus
employs
a
worker
who
otherwise
would
have
had
a
job
,
the
stimulus
is
increasing
labor
demand
while
labor
supply
remains
fixed
,
leading
to
wage
inflation
and
therefore
price
inflation
.

Fiscal
straitjacket
The
concept
of
a
fiscal
straitjacket
is
a
general
economic
principle
that
suggests
strict
constraints
on
government
spending
and
public
sector
borrowing
,
to
limit
or
regulate
the
budget
deficit
over
a
time
period
.

The
term
probably
originated
from
the
definition
of
straitjacket
(
anything
that
severely
confines
,
constricts
,
or
hinders
)
.

Various
states
in
the
United
States
have
various
forms
of
self-imposed
fiscal
straitjackets
.

Lake
Taupo
is
a
lake
situated
in
the
North
Island
of
New
Zealand
.

With
a
surface
area
of
,
it
is
the
largest
lake
by
surface
area
in
New
Zealand
,
and
the
second
largest
freshwater
lake
by
surface
area
in
geopolitical
Oceania
after
Lake
Murray
(
Papua
New
Guinea
)
.

Lake
Taupo
has
a
perimeter
of
approximately
000
kilometres
,
a
deepest
point
of
000
metres
.

It
is
drained
by
the
Waikato
River
(
New
Zealand
's
longest
river
)
,
while
its
main
tributaries
are
the
Waitahanui
River
,
the
Tongariro
River
,
and
the
Tauranga
Taupo
River
.

It
is
a
noted
trout
fishery
with
stocks
of
introduced
brown
trout
and
rainbow
trout
.

Lake
formation
and
volcanism
Lake
Taupo
lies
in
a
caldera
created
by
a
supervolcanic
eruption
which
occurred
approximately
00,000
years
ago
.

According
to
geological
records
,
the
volcano
has
erupted
00
times
in
the
last
00,000
years
.

It
has
ejected
mostly
rhyolitic
lava
,
although
Mount
Tauhara
formed
from
dacitic
lava
.

The
initial
event
00,000
years
ago
is
the
largest
eruption
and
is
known
as
the
Oruanui
eruption
.

It
ejected
an
estimated
0000
cubic
kilometres
of
material
and
caused
several
hundred
square
kilometres
of
surrounding
land
to
collapse
and
form
the
caldera
.

The
caldera
later
filled
with
water
,
eventually
overflowing
to
cause
a
huge
outwash
flood
.

It
is
possible
that
the
Lake
Taupo
event
contributed
to
starting
the
Last
Glacial
Maximum
.

Several
later
eruptions
occurred
over
the
millennia
before
the
most
recent
major
eruption
,
which
is
traditionally
dated
as
about
000
CE
from
Greenland
ice-core
records
.

Tree
ring
data
from
two
studies
suggests
a
later
date
of
000
CE
±
0
.

Known
as
the
Hatepe
eruption
,
it
is
believed
to
have
ejected
000
cubic
kilometres
of
material
,
of
which
00
cubic
kilometres
was
ejected
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
.

This
was
one
of
the
most
violent
eruptions
in
the
last
0000
years
(
alongside
the
Tianchi
eruption
of
Baekdu
at
around
0000
and
the
0000
eruption
of
Tambora
)
,
with
a
Volcanic
Explosivity
Index
rating
of
0
;
and
there
appears
to
be
a
correlation
,
to
within
a
few
years
,
of
a
year
in
which
the
sky
was
red
over
Rome
and
China
.

The
eruption
devastated
much
of
the
North
Island
and
further
expanded
the
lake
.

The
area
was
uninhabited
by
humans
at
the
time
of
the
eruption
,
since
New
Zealand
was
not
settled
by
the
Māori
until
about
0000
.

Possible
climatic
effects
of
the
eruption
would
have
been
concentrated
on
the
southern
hemisphere
due
to
the
southerly
position
of
Lake
Taupo
.

Taupo
's
last
known
eruption
occurred
around
00
years
later
,
with
lava
dome
extrusion
forming
the
Horomatangi
Reefs
,
but
that
eruption
was
much
smaller
than
the
000
CE
eruption
.

Underwater
hydrothermal
activity
continues
near
the
Horomatangi
vent
,
and
nearby
geothermal
fields
with
associated
hot
springs
are
found
north
and
south
of
the
lake
,
for
example
at
Rotokawa
and
Turangi
.

These
springs
are
the
site
of
occurrence
of
certain
extremophile
micro-organisms
,
that
are
capable
of
surviving
in
extremely
hot
environments
.

The
volcano
is
currently
considered
to
be
dormant
rather
than
extinct
.

Biota
Much
of
the
watershed
of
Lake
Taupo
is
a
beech
and
podocarp
forest
with
associate
understory
ferns
being
Blechnum
filiforme
,
Asplenium
flaccidum
,
Doodia
media
,
Hymenophyllum
demissum
,
Microsorum
pustulatum
and
Microsorum
scandens
,
and
some
prominent
associate
shrubs
being
Olearia
ranii
nd
Alseuosmia
quercifolia
.

Native
faunal
species
in
the
lake
include
northern
koura
or
crayfish
(
Paranephrops
planifrons
)
and
kokopu
or
whitebait
(
Galaxias
species
)
.

The
lake
is
noted
for
stocks
of
brown
trout
(
Salmo
trutta
)
and
rainbow
trout
(
Oncorhynchus
mykiss
)
,
introduced
from
Europe
and
California
respectively
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
.

There
has
also
been
a
subsequent
introduction
of
smelt
(
Retropinnidae
species
)
as
a
food
for
the
trout
.

A
community
of
sponges
and
associated
invertebrates
live
around
the
underwater
geothermal
vents
.

Tourism
Tourism
is
a
major
component
of
Taupo
's
commercial
sector
,
and
the
city
attracts
over
0.0
million
visitors
per
year
.

The
busiest
time
for
the

is
the
high
summer
season
around
Christmas
and
New

tribes
to
the
Taupo
area
over
a
thousand
years
ago
according
to
Māori
legend
.

The
00-metre-high
carving
is
intended
to
protect
Lake

History
The
year
0000
is
the
first
record
of
John
Hart
’s
“
logg
”
,
near
where
Alexandria
is
located
now
.

During
the
land
purchase
of
0000
James
Sterrat
of
Carlisle
purchased
000
acres
including
the
sleeping
place
called
John
Hart
’s
log
on
the
Juniata
River
,
which
is
now
Alexandria
.

Some
time
in
the
years
before
0000
the
first
mention
of
a
religious
group
called
Hartslog
Presbyterian
Congregation
was
formed
.

A
log
worship
house
,
Old
Hartslog
Church
,
stood
upon
the
hill
one
mile
(
0.0
km
)
north
of
the
present
site
of
the
town
of
Alexandria
,
where
a
burial
ground
was
later
made
.

This
was
a
primitive
structure
but
by
0000
a
floor
was
laid
,
six
large
windows
set
in
,
a
large
door
constructed
,
and
a
pulpit
and
a
communion
table
made
.

In
0000
it
was
laid
off
into
four
sections
,
and
fitted
with
pews
.

In
0000
,
the
old
Hartslog
congregation
moved
to
a
brick
building
,
referred
to
by
Senator
John
Scott
in
his
memoirs
as
the
"
Brick
Church
"
,
which
seems
to
have
been
located
near
to
the
site
of
the
present
Reformed
Church
.

The
old
log
worship
house
was
taken
down
the
same
year
,
and
some
of
its
logs
were
used
in
one
or
two
of
the
dwellings
of
Alexandria
.

In
the
late
00th
century
the
primary
transportation
to
and
from
Alexandria
was
the
Juniata
River
,
suitable
only
during
summer
and
when
the
water
depth
permitted
.

On
May
0
,
0000
the
new
road
from
Harrisburg
to
Alexandria
opened
,
permitting
a
more
reliable
connection
with
the
outside
world
.

In
0000
the
Juniata
Division
of
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
was
opened
,
the
promise
of
better
transportation
started
a
mini
housing
boom
in
Alexandria
.

By
0000
the
canal
was
abandoned
and
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
managed
the
transportation
needs
of
the
area
.

Around
this
time
the
growth
of
the
area
slowed
,
the
while
the
populations
of
Huntingdon
and
Hollidaysburg
grew
.

Hartslog
Heritage
Day
Festival
Alexandria
hosts
the
annual
"
Hartslog
Heritage
Day
"
celebration
each
year
on
the
second
Saturday
of
October
.

The
day-long
event
recognizes
the
early
days
of
the
small
borough
,
when
,
in
0000
,
a
licensed
Indian
trader
named
John
Hart
used
a
large
hollowed-out
log
to
feed
and
salt
his
horses
while
he
conducted
his
trading
.

Early
settlers
used
this
log
as
a
landmark
to
describe
the
location
of
their
claims
and
referred
to
this
area
as
Hartslog
Settlement
.

In
0000
this
area
was
laid
out
into
town
lots
and
named
Alexandria
,
with
the
street
near
the
site

Birmingham
is
the
site
of
the
Birmingham
Window
,
a
geologic
structure
created
by
a
Paleozoic
thrust
fault
.

Birmingham
's
early
settler
,
John
Cadwallader
,
settled
on
a
hill
above
the
Little
Juniata
River
and
made
plans
to
establish
a
large
city
.

Legend
among
the
local
residents
is
that
it
was
once
in
consideration
to
be
the
state
capital
.

In
the
first
several
decades
of
the
00th
century
,
the
village
grew
quickly
as
a
hub
for
commerce
being
carried
on
the
Little
Juniata
River
and
on
the
nearby
Pennsylvania
Canal
.

By
0000
,
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
had
passed
through
the
valley
.

The
development
of
the
railroad
diminished
the
importance
of
Birmingham
as
a
trading
hub
since
the
railroad
's
nearby
hubs
in
Tyrone
and
Altoona
grew
quickly
on
land
that
was
better
suited
for
development
.

In
0000
,
the
Mountain
Female
Seminary
opened
in
Birmingham
as
a
boarding
school
for

.

In
its
earliest
years
,
the
school
benefited
from
the
ease
of
transportation
afforded
by
the
passage
of
the
Pennsylvania
railroad
through
Birmingham
.

Currently
,
the
school
still
operates
as

School
,
a

History
The
narrow

East
Broad
Top
Railroad
was
constructed
through
the
community
in
0000
.

Rockhill
was
selected
as
the
location
of
the
railroad
's
maintenance
facility
.

The
parent
company
Rockhill
Iron
and
Coal
,
located
their
dual-stack
coke
fired
iron
furnace
here
.

Rockhill
as
it
exists
today
was
created
by
the
coal
company
and
the
railroad
as
a
support
community
for
their
infrastructure
.

The
iron
furnace
shut
down
for
the
last
time
in
0000
and
the
railroad
became
the
primary
employer
.

The

but
a
portion
from

History
Saltillo
was
named
after
the
Mexican
War
Battle
of
Saltillo
(
00
October
0000
)
.

It
was
a
major
tanning
center
during
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
century
.

The
Leas
and
McVitty
Tannery
was
located
here
,
a
tannery
known
for
quality
hides
.

The
main
line
of
the
East
Broad
Top
Railroad
and
Coal
Company
was
built
through
Saltillo
in
0000
.

The
railroad
serviced
the
tannery
as
well
as
a
short
lived
iron
mine
and
an
equally
short
lived
limestone
quarry
,
both
just
southeast
of
town
.

Saltillo
was
an
important
place
on
the
EBT
acting
as
a
base
station
for
the
long
grade
up
to
Broad
Top
Mountain
.

The
EBT
had
a
three
track
yard
,
a
station
,
a
water
tank
and
a
turning
wye
located
here
.

Just
after
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
a
large
Ganister
quarry
was
established
above
Saltillo
on
Jacks
Mountain
by
Mount
Union
Refractories
(
later
United
States
Refractories
and
North
American
Refractories
)
to
supply
their
plant
in
Mount
Union
,
Pennsylvania
.

In
0000
a
spur
was
built
from
the
EBT
yard
in
Saltillo
which
climbed
the
mountain
to
a
tipple
below
the
quarry
.

The
branch
was
the
steepest
track
on
the
EBT
and
remained
in
service
until
the
line
closed
in
0000
.

The
quarry
continued
to
operated
into
the
0000s
,
serviced
by
trucks
.

Saltillo
was
also
the
location
of
a
grist
mill
which
still
exists
at
the
southwest
edge
of
town
.

The
EBT
tracks
on
Saltillo
are
still
in
place
.

The
water
tank
was
burned
by
vandals
in
the
late
0000s
and
the
station
was
demolished
in
the
mid-0000s
after
being
allowed
to
deteriorate
to
deplorable
condition
.

In
the
late
0000s
the
skeleton
of
a
mastodon
was
discovered
near
Saltillo
and
it
was
excavated
by
a
team
from
Penn
State
University

The
sleeping
car
or
sleeper
(
often
)
is
a
railway/railroad
passenger
car
that
can
accommodate
all
its
passengers
in
beds
of
one
kind
or
another
,
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
making
nighttime
travel
more
restful
.

The
first
such
cars
saw
sporadic
use
on
American
railroads
in
the
0000s
and
could
be
configured
for
coach
seating
during
the
day
.

Some
of
the
more
luxurious
types
have
private
rooms
,
that
is
to
say
fully
and
solidly
enclosed
rooms
that
are
not
shared
with
strangers
.

In
the
United
States
today
,
all
regularly
scheduled
sleeping
car
services
are
operated
by
Amtrak
.

Amtrak
offers
sleeping
cars
on
most
of
its
overnight
trains
,
using
modern
cars
of
the
private-room
type
exclusively
.

In
Canada
,
all
regularly
scheduled
sleeping
car
services
are
operated
by
Via
Rail
,
using
a
mixture
of
relatively
new
cars
and
refurbished
mid-century
ones
;
the
latter
cars
include
both
private
rooms
and
"
open
section
"
accommodations
.

An
example
of
a
more
basic
type
of
sleeping
car
is
the
European
couchette
car
,
which
is
divided
into
compartments
for
four
or
six
people
,
with
bench-configuration
seating
during
the
day
and
"
privacyless
"
double
-
or
triple-level
bunk-beds
at
night
.

Even
more
basic
is
the
Chinese
"
hard
"
sleeping
car
in
use
today
,
consisting
of
fixed
bunk
beds
,
which
can
not
be
converted
into
seats
,
in
a
public
space
.

Chinese
trains
also
offer
"
soft
"
or
deluxe
sleeping
cars
with
four
or
two
beds
per
room
.

History
The
Cumberland
Valley
Railroad
pioneered
sleeping
car
service
in
the
spring
of
0000
,
with
a
car
named
"
Chambersburg
,
"
between
Chambersburg
and
Harrisburg
,
Pennsylvania
.

A
couple
of
years
later
a
second
car
,
the
"
Carlisle
,
"
was
introduced
into
service
.

In
0000
,
the
Wason
Manufacturing
Company
of
Springfield
,
Massachusetts
-
one
of
the
United
States
'
first
makers
of
railway
passenger
coach
equipment
-
produced
America
's
first
,
specifically
designed
sleeping
car
.

The
man
who
ultimately
made
the
sleeping
car
business
profitable
in
the
United
States
was
George
Pullman
,
who
began
by
building
a
luxurious
sleeping
car
(
named
Pioneer
)
in
0000
.

The
Pullman
Company
,
founded
as
the
Pullman
Palace
Car
Company
in
0000
,
owned
and
operated
most
sleeping
cars
in
the
United
States
until
the
mid-00th
century
,
attaching
them
to
passenger
train
s
run
by
the
various
railroads
;
there
were
also
some
sleeping
cars
that
were
operated
by
Pullman
but
owned
by
the
railroad
running
a
given
train
.

During
the
peak
years
of
American
passenger
railroading
,
several
all-Pullman
trains
existed
,
including
the
00th
Century
Limited
on
the
New
York
Central
Railroad
,
the
Broadway
Limited
on
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
the
Panama
Limited
on
the
Illinois
Central
Railroad
,
and
the
Super
Chief
on
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
and
Santa
Fe
Railway
.

Pullman
cars
were
normally
a
dark
"
Pullman
green
,
"
although
some
were
painted
in
the
host
railroad
's
colors
.

The
cars
carried
individual
names
,
but
usually
did
not
carry
visible
numbers
.

In
the
0000s
the
Pullman
Company
went
through
a
series
of
restructuring
steps
,
which
in
the
end
resulted
in
a
parent
company
,
Pullman
Incorporated
,
controlling
the
Pullman
Company
(
which
owned
and
operated
sleeping
cars
)
and
the
Pullman-Standard
Car
Manufacturing
Company
.

Due
to
an
antitrust
verdict
in
0000
,
a
consortium
of
railroads
bought
the
Pullman
Company
from
Pullman
Incorporated
,
and
subsequently
railroads
owned
and
operated
Pullman-made
sleeping
cars
themselves
.

Pullman-Standard
continued
manufacturing
sleeping
cars
and
other
passenger
and
freight
railroad
cars
until
0000
.

Open-section
accommodation
From
the
00th
to
the
mid-00th
century
,
the
most
common
type
of
sleeping
car
accommodation
on
North
American
trains
was
the
"
open-section
.
"

Open-section
accommodations
consist
of
pairs
of
seats
,
one
seat
facing
forward
and
the
other
backward
,
situated
on
either
side
of
a
center
aisle
.

The
seat
pairs
can
be
converted
into
the
combination
of
an
upper
and
a
lower
"
berth
,
"
each
berth
consisting
of
a
bed
screened
from
the
aisle
by
a
curtain
.

A
famous
example
of
open-sections
can
be
seen
in
the
movie
Some
Like
It
Hot
.

As
the
00th
century
progressed
,
an
increasing
variety
of
private
rooms
were
offered
.

Most
of
these
rooms
provided
significantly
more
space
than
open-section
accommodations
could
offer
.

Some
of
them
,
such
as
the
rooms
of
the
misleadingly-named
"
Slumbercoach
"
cars
manufactured
by
the
Budd
Company
and
first
put
into
service
in
0000
,
were
triumphs
of
miniaturization
.

Modern
times
Today
,
Amtrak
operates
two
main
types
of
sleeping
car
:
the
bi-level
Superliner
sleeping
cars
,
built
from
the
late
0000s
to
the
mid-0000s
,
and
the
single-level
Viewliner
sleeping
cars
,
built
in
the
mid-0000s
.

In
the
most
common
Superliner
sleeping
car
configuration
,
the
upper
level
is
divided
into
two
halves
,
one
half
containing
"
Bedrooms
"
(
formerly
"
Deluxe
Bedrooms
"
)
for
one
,
two
,
or
three
travelers
,
each
Bedroom
containing
an
enclosed
toilet-and-shower
facility
;
and
the
other
half
containing
"
Roomette
s
"
(
formerly
"
Economy
Bedrooms
"
or
"
Standard
Bedrooms
"
)
for
one
or
two
travelers
;
plus
a
beverage
area
and
a
toilet
.

The
lower
level
contains
more
Roomettes
;
a
Family
Bedroom
for
as
many
as
two
adults
and
two
children
;
and
an
"
Accessible
Bedroom
"
(
formerly
"
Handicapped
Bedroom
"
)
for
a
wheelchair-using
traveler
and
a
companion
;
plus
toilets
and
a
shower
.

The
Viewliner
cars
contain
an
Accessible
Bedroom
(
formerly
"
Handicapped
Bedroom
"
)
for
a
wheelchair-using
traveler
and
a
companion
,
with
an
enclosed
toilet-and-shower
facility
;
two
Bedrooms
(
formerly
"
Deluxe
Bedrooms
"
)
for
one
,
two
,
or
three
travelers
,
each
Bedroom
containing
an
enclosed
toilet-and-shower
facility
;
"
Roomettes
"
(
formerly
"
Economy
Bedrooms
,
"
"
Standard
Bedrooms
,
"
or
"
Compartments
"
)
for
one
or
two
travelers
,
each
Roomette
containing
its
own
unenclosed
toilet
and
washing
facilities
;
and
a
shower
room
at
the
end
of
the
car
.

A
particularly
interesting
practice
in
sleeping
car
operation
,
one
that
is
not
currently
employed
in
North
America
,
is
the
use
of
"
set-out
"
sleepers
.

Sleeping
cars
are
picked
up
and/or
dropped
off
at
intermediate
cities
along
a
train
's
route
so
that
what
would
otherwise
be
partial-night
journeys
can
become
(
in
effect
)
full-night
journeys
,
with
passengers
allowed
to
occupy
their
sleeping
accommodations
from
mid-evening
to
at
least
the
early
morning
.

Common
practise
on
such
occasions
is
to
close
the
passages
between
sleeper
cars
for
the
night
to
prevent
accidental
wrong
destinations
if
the
sleeper
is
transferred
to
another
train
.

Cultural
impact
of
Pullman
porters
One
unanticipated
consequence
of
the
rise
of
Pullman
cars
in
the
US
in
the
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
was
their
effect
on
civil
rights
and
African
American
culture
.

Each
Pullman
car
was
staffed
by
a
uniformed
porter
.

These
were
almost
always
African-American
s
and
,
by
convention
,
were
often
addressed
as
"
George
"
by
passengers
.

Porters
worked
under
deplorable
conditions
that
included
poor
wages
,
segregation
from
white
passengers
,
a
glass
ceiling
,
and
unequal
rights
as
employees
.

Subsequently
,
railway
porters
fought
for
political
recognition
and
were
eventually
unionized
.

Their
union
,
the
Brotherhood
of
Sleeping
Car
Porters
,
became
an
important
source
of
strength
for
the
burgeoning
civil
rights
movement
in
the
early
00th
century
,
notably
under
the
leadership
of
A.
Philip
Randolph
.

Because
they
moved
about
the
country
,
Pullman
porters
also
became
an
important
means
of
communication
for
news
and
cultural
information
of
all
kinds
.

The
African-American
newspaper
the
Chicago
Defender
gained
a
national
circulation
in
this
way
.

Porters
also
used
to
re-sell
phonograph
record
s
bought
in
the
great
metropolitan
centres
,
greatly
adding
to
the
distribution
of
jazz
and
blues
and
the
popularity
of
the
artists
.

Night
trains
today
Although
reduced
in
prevalence
in
recent
decades
in
the
Western
world
,
sleeping
cars
retain
a
powerful
ability
to
provide
travel
that
is
both
reasonably
comfortable
and
potentially
time-saving
,
especially
between
points
that
are
between
and
apart
,
distances
that
one
can
travel
overnight
,
perhaps
with
dinner
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
or
breakfast
at
the
end
.

This
offers
efficiency
in
passing
the
time
and
distance
by
allowing
travelers
to
do
things
that
might
be
done
in
a
hotel
room
during
the
same
hours
.

The
obvious
advantage
over
day
trains
(
even
high-speed
ones
)
is
that
it
takes
up
less
daytime
.

Sleeper
cars
are
still
popular
in
the
Indian
sub-continent
where
trains
are
the
major
mode
of
transport
.

A
sleeping
car
is
,
in
essence
,
a
moving
house
of
lodging
.

A
night
in
transit
can
replace
a
hotel
stay
at
the
destination
.

Even
where
sleepers
are
more
expensive
than
high-speed
day
trains
or
other
modes
of
transport
,
the
extra
cost
may
be
less
than
that
of
a
night
at
a
hotel
.

Despite
its
decline
in
recent
eras
,
overnight
sleeping
car
still
has
its
advantages
over
air
travel
.

Many
overnight
trains
arrive
at
their
destination
cities
in
the
morning
,
hardly
possible
with
air
travel
,
as
modern
airports
tend
to
be
built
at
a
distance
from
city
centres
and
extra
transport
is
necessary
to
enter
cities
.

This
advantage
is
especially
pronounced
in
major
cities
of
China
,
where
hard
sleeper
prices
are
very
competitive
,
or
in
Russia
and
Ukraine
,
where
sleeper
prices
are
reasonable
and
the
train
compartments
can
be
quite
comfortable
.

AustraliaOvernight
trains
in
Australia
,
which
usually
run
between
state
capital
cities
,
have
changed
over
the
last
00
years
or
so
,
probably
as
the
result
of
competition
by
cheaper
air
fares
between
those
same
cities
.

They
have
mostly
either
been
replaced
by
day
trains
(
such
as
The
Overland
between
Adelaide
and
Melbourne
)
-
sometimes
medium-speed
day
trains
(
such
as
the
CountryLink
XPT
between
Melbourne
and
Sydney
)
-
or
else
they
have
remained
,
but
been
refurbished
with
the
intention
of
attracting
tourists
for
whom
the
train
trip
is
itself
an
attraction
,
instead
of
being
a
functional
means
of
transport
(
such
as
The
Ghan
,
running
between
Adelaide
and
Darwin
,
and
the
Indian
Pacific
,
running
between
Sydney
and
Perth
)
.

In
these
cases
,
the
facilities
provided
are
often
upgraded
,
so
that
the
train
becomes
almost
like
a
hotel
in
some
ways
,
and
the
fares
in
such
cases
can
be
very
expensive
.

This
has
happened
at
approximately
the
same
time
as
management
of
the
trains
has
been
transferred
from
government
railways
to
private
companies
.

Relatively
inexpensive
sleeper
services
have
been
retained
between
Melbourne
and

,
Sydney

China
China
's
railways
operate
an
extensive
network
of
sleeper
trains
throughout
the
country
,
covering
all
provincial
capitals
and
many
major
cities
.

With
track
upgrades
,
service
speeds
have
increased
;
since

,
a
high-speed
CRH0

sleeper
train
service
even
runs
between

Europe
In
Europe
,
the
Compagnie
Internationale
des
Wagons-Lits
(
French
for
"
International
Sleeping
Car
Company
"
)
first
focused
on
sleeping
cars
,
but
later
operated
whole
trains
,
including
the
Simplon-Orient
Express
,
Nord
Express
,
Train
Bleu
,
Golden
Arrow
,
and
the
Transsiberien
(
on
the
Trans-Siberian
railway
)
.

Today
it
once
again
specializes
in
sleeping
cars
,
along
with
onboard
railroad
catering
.

In
modern
Europe
,
a
substantial
number
of
sleeping
car
services
continue
to
operate
,
though
they
face
strong
competition
from
high-speed
day
trains
and
budget
airlines
.

In
some
cases
,
trains
are
split
and
recombined
in
the
dead
of
night
,
making
it
possible
to
offer
several
connections
with
a
relatively
small
number
of
trains
.

Generally
,
the
trains
consist
of
sleeping
cars
with
private
compartments
,
couchette
cars
,
and
sometimes
cars
with
normal
seating
.

In
the
United
Kingdom
,
a
network
of
trains
with
sleeping
cars
operates
daily
between
London
and
Scotland
(
Caledonian
Sleeper
)
,
and
between
London
and
the
West
Country
as
far
as
Cornwall
(
Night
Riviera
)
.

Using
rolling
stock
designed
and
formerly
operated
by
British
Rail
,
these
services
offer
a
choice
of
single
-
or
double-occupancy
bedrooms
.

These
services
operate
all
week
,
except
Saturdays
and
usually
depart
London
(
Euston
and
Paddington
)
in
the
evening
,
arriving
at
their
destinations
at
approx
0000h
.

Deutsche
Bahn
's
modern
City
Night
Line
services
serve
the
majority
of
countries
in
Western
and
Central
Europe
,
including
Germany
,
the
Netherlands
,
Austria
,
Denmark
,
Italy
and
the
Czech
Republic
.

The
services
usually
leave
at
around
00.00
hours
and
arrive
at
around
00.00
hours
at
the
destination
.

In
Italy
,
Ferrovie
dello
Stato
operates
an
extensive
network
of
trains
with
sleeping
cars
,
especially
between
the
main
cities
in
Northern
Italy
and
the
South
,
including
Sicily
.

Another
of
the
more
substantial
examples
of
current
European
sleeping
car
service
is
the
Train
Bleu
,
an
all-sleeping-car
train
.

The
train
leaves
Paris
from
the
Gare
d'Austerlitz
in
mid
evening
and
arrives
in
Nice
about
0
in
the
morning
,
providing
both
first-class
rooms
and
couchette
accommodations
.

The
train
's
principal
popularity
is
with
older
travelers
;
it
has
not
won
the
same
degree
of
popularity
with
younger
travelers
.

Recently
,
the
upper
class
coaches
(
wagons
lits
)
have
been
sold
to
foreign
railroad
companies
,
so
that
only
couchette
car
s
(
0st
and
0nd
class
)
as
well
as
seating
coaches
remain
.

The
Train
Bleu
is
part
of
the
French
night
service
network
called
Corail
Lunéa
.

In
Russia
and
Ukraine
,
the
national
rail
services
operate
a
large
number
of
night
trains
with
private
compartments
containing
seats
convertible
into
sleeping
berths
.

These
night
trains
are
a
prime
method
of
travel
,
with
ticket
prices
quite
reasonable
by
Western
standards
,
and
with
the
distances
between
the
capitals
of
Moscow
and
Kiev
and
many
outlying
cities
being
ideal
for
overnight
trips
that
depart
in
late
evening
and
arrive
at
their
destinations
in
the
morning
.

Sleeping
cars
are
the
only
reasonable
solution
for
railway
trips
lasting
several
days
(
e.g.
direct
trains
from
Moscow
to
Siberian
cities
)
.

India
A
major
portion
of
passenger
cars
in
India
are
sleeper
/
couchette
cars
.

With
railways
as
the
primary
mode
of
passenger
transport
,
sleeper
cars
vary
from
economical
to
First
Class
AC
(
air
conditioned
)
.

Most
Indian
trains
(
all
operated
by
the
state-run
Indian
Railways
)
come
in
combinations
of
first
class
A/C
and
non-A/C
private
sleeper
cars
with
doors
and
A/C
and
non-A/C
0-tier
or
0-tier
couchette
arrangements
.

Japan
had
once
many
sleeper
car
trains
,
but
most
of
them
are
abolished
because
of
the
development
of
air
and
high
speed
rail
.

As
of
March

,
sleeper

trains
of
regular
service
in

,
the
Malaysian
national
railway
company
,
offers

service
on
several
of

Sometimes
the
same
trip
can
be
made
either
during
the
day
in
a
normal
carriage
or
at
night
on
a
sleeper
.

In
the
card
game
contract
bridge
,
an
entry-shifting
squeeze
is
a
mixture
between
a
material
squeeze
and
an
immaterial
squeeze
.

The
material
part
is
the
same
as
in
a
trump
squeeze
or
a
squeeze
without
the
count
.

The
immaterial
part
is
that
depending
on
the
choice
of
discards
of
the
squeezee
an
entry
into
one
or
into
the
other
hand
is
created
.

For
that
very
reason
an
entry-shifting
squeeze
is
always
a
positional
squeeze
.

Examples
In
the
first
diagram
clubs
are
trumps
and
South
could
claim
all
tricks
on
a
crossruff
were
it
not
for
the
trump
in
East
's
hand
.

When
the
club
jack
is
played
,
the
entry-shifting
squeeze
comes
to
his
rescue
.

If
West
sheds
a
heart
,
the
jack
is
overtaken
with
the
ace
,
a
heart
ruffed
and
North
is
left
with
the
last
trump
and
a
master
heart
.

If
West
chooses
to
discard
a
diamond
,
the
club
jack
is
underplayed
with
the
five
.

North
's
club
ace
ruffs
the
diamonds
good
and
the
South
hand
wins
the
last
two
tricks
.

The
entry-shifting
mechanism
works
also
in
No
Trumps
,
as
can
be
seen
in
the
next
example
.

As
only
five
tricks
out
of
remaining
six
cards
are
required
,
this
is
a
squeeze
without
the
count
.

It
is
not
possible
to
rectify
the
count
as
there
are
not
enough
communications
between
the
two
hands
.

The
entry-shifting
mechanism
will
overcome
this
though
.

South
leads
the
A
and
West
has
no
good
discard
.

If
he
discards
a
spade
,
the
J
is
played
and
South
continues
with
a
spade
to
the
ace
and
the
spade
eight
.

West
returns
a
heart
to
South
's
ace
,
but
the
diamond
king
serves
as
an
entry
to
the
established
spades
.

If
West
chooses
to
discard
a
heart
,
the
diamond
king
is
played
and
after
ace
of
hearts
and
another
heart
,
the
Q
will
serve
as
an
entry
.

Glen
Campbell
is
a
borough
in
Indiana
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the

census
.

History
The
borough
was
named
in
0000
for
Cornelius
Campbell
,
the
first
superintendent
of
the
Glenwood
Coal
Company
(
glen
is
the
Scottish
word
for
valley
)
,
which
mined
in
that
area
.

The
modern
singer
Glen
Campbell
visited
Glen
Campbell
in
0000
.

The
distinguished
academic
Glenn
Campbell
did
also
at
some
point
.

Michael
William
Menosky
,
a
professional
baseball
player
,
also
known
as
"
Leaping
Mike
"
for
his
speed
and
circus
like
catches
in
the
outfield
,
was
born
in
Glen
Campbell
on
October
00
,
0000
.

At
some
point
,
the
family
moved
about
0
miles
away
to
Arcadia
.

Leaping
Mike
went
on
to
play
baseball
from
0000
to
0000
.

He
played
for
the
Pittsburgh
Rebels
,
Washington
Senators
,
and
the
Boston
Red
Sox
.

He
was
the
guy
that
replaced
Babe
Ruth
in
left
field
after
Babe
Ruth
was
sold
to
the
Yankees
beginning
what
was
referred
to
as
"
the

"
in
boston
.

Glen
Campbell
,
the
first
coal
town
in
Indiana
County
,
was
founded
in
0000
.

It
was
named
for
Cornelius
Campbell
,
the
first
superintendent
of
the
Glenwood
Coal
Company
,
the
enterprise
which
initiated
mining
operations
in
the
area
.

The
town
experienced
immediate
growth
and
soon
a
number
of
coal
companies
were
operating
in
and
around
the
community
.

In
0000
,
just
five
years
after
its
inception
,
Glen
Campbell
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

The
town
quickly
became
the
service
,
business
,
and
shopping
center
for
a
number
of
smaller
mining
communities
that
sprang
up
in
northern
Indiana
County
.

By
0000
Glen
Campbell
was
the
third
largest
town
in
Indiana
County
.

It
also
had
the
distinction
of
being
the
county
's
fastest
growing
community
.

In
fact
,
residents
of
the
community
felt
it
was
feasible
,
with
such
growth
,
that
eventually
the
county
seat
would
have
to
be
moved
to
Glen
Campbell
.

The
town
was
serviced
by
both
the
Pennsylvania
and
New
York
Central
railroads
.

In
addition
to
coal
mining
,
there
were
a
number
of
lumber
mills
.

In
0000
the
Giant
Electric
Light
,
Heat
,
and
Power
Company
opened
operations
in
Glen
Campbell
.

The
company
provided
electricity
to
communities
in
northern
Indiana
and
southern
Clearfield
counties
.

Other
industries
included
a
brickyard
which
was
established
on
the
Cush
Creek
,
a
stream
that
flows
through
the
community
,
and
a
cooper
's
shop
which
manufactured
barrels
.

Later
a
battery
factory
was
opened
.

There
also
were
plans
for
the
construction
of
a
foundry
and
a
furniture
factory
.

At
its
height
of
prosperity
,
the
town
had
approximately
00
businesses
.

There
was
an
opera
house
and
a
nickelodeon
.

The
community
boasted
its
own
school
system
,
which
included
a
high
school
.

There
were
a
number
of
dentists
and
doctors
.

One
doctor
even
operated
an
infirmary
for
the
miners
.

The
borough
had
its
own
bank
,
the
First
National
Bank
of
Glen
Campbell
.

A
number
of
newspapers
were
published
in
the
town
and
many
social
organizations
sprang
up
.

Unfortunately
,
the
bubble
burst
.

Labor
unrest
,
the
decline
in
coal
output
,
the
depletion
of
the
timber
stocks
,
and
a
number
of
disastrous
fires
left
Glen
Campbell
in
a
serious
financial
dilemma
.

The
Great
Depression
of
the
0000s
dealt
the
town
its
final
and
most
crippling
blow
.

The
bank
was
forced
to
close
permanently
and
a
number
of
businesses
either
folded
or
moved
elsewhere
.

The
community
never
recovered
from
the
trauma
and
continued
its
spiraling
decline
.

Although
its
heyday
has
long
since
passed
,
the
town
still
has
the
capability
of
attracting
notoriety
.

It
received
national
attention
in
0000
when
Glen
Campbell
,
the
country
music
singer
,
made
a
surprise
visit
.

The
trip
was
featured
in
a
TV
Guide
article
later
that
year
.

Although
no
longer
the
size
it
once
was
,
Glen
Campbell
continues
to
function
in
its
own
right
.

The
town
's
fire
company
provides
fire
protection
to
a
number
of
communities
in
the
area
.

Its
three
churches
(
Methodist
,
Baptist
,
and
Roman
Catholic
)
all
have
active
congregations
.

Social
organizations
include
the
American
Legion
and
the
Glen
Campbell
Fireman
's
Auxiliary
.

The
town
's
post
office
still
provides
rural
services
to
a
large
area
surrounding
the
borough
.

There
are
a
number
of
businesses
,
including
some
which
are
coal
related
,
that
call
Glen
Campbell
home
.

In
mathematics
and
computer
science
,
a
tuple
is
an
ordered
list
of
elements
.

In
set
theory
,
an
(
ordered
)
n-tuple
is
a
sequence
(
or
ordered
list
)
of
n
elements
,
where
n
is
a
non-negative
integer
.

There
is
only
one
0-tuple
,
an
empty
sequence
.

An
n-tuple
is
defined
inductively
using
the
construction
of
an
ordered
pair
.

Tuples
are
usually
written
by
listing
the
elements
within
parentheses
"
(
\
text
)
"
and
separated
by
commas
;
for
example
,
(
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
)
denotes
a
0-tuple
.

Sometimes
other
delimiters
are
used
,
such
as
square
brackets
"
[
\
text
]
"
or
angle
brackets
"
\
langle
\
text
\
rangle
"
.

Braces
"
\
"
are
almost
never
used
for
tuples
,
as
they
are
the
standard
notation
for
sets
.

Tuples
are
often
used
to
describe
other
mathematical
objects
,
such
as
vectors
.

In
computer
science
,
tuples
are
directly
implemented
as
product
type
s
in
most
functional
programming
languages
.

More
commonly
,
they
are
implemented
as
record
types
,
where
the
components
are
labeled
instead
of
being
identified
by
position
alone
.

This
approach
is
also
used
in
relational
algebra
.

Tuples
are
also
used
in
relation
to
programming
the
semantic
web
with
Resource
Description
Framework
or
RDF
.

Etymology
The
term
originated
as
an
abstraction
of
the
sequence
:
single
,
double
,
triple
,
quadruple
,
quintuple
,
sextuple
,
septuple
,
octuple
,
...
,
n‑tuple
,
...
,
where
the
prefixes
are
taken
from
the
Latin
names
of
the
numerals
.

The
unique
0‑tuple
is
called
the
null
tuple
.

A
0‑tuple
is
called
a
singleton
,
a
0‑tuple
is
called
an
ordered
pair
and
a
0‑tuple
is
a
triple
or
triplet
.

n
can
be
any
nonnegative
integer
.

For
example
,
a
complex
number
can
be
represented
as
a
0‑tuple
,
a
quaternion
can
be
represented
as
a
0‑tuple
,
an
octonion
can
be
represented
as
an
0‑tuple
and
a
sedenion
can
be
represented
as
a
00‑tuple
.

Although
these
uses
treat
tuple
as
the
suffix
,
the
original
suffix
was
ple
as
in
"
triple
"
(
three-fold
)
or
"
decuple
"
(
ten‑fold
)
.

This
originates
from
a
medieval
Latin
suffix
plus
(
meaning
"
more
"
)
related
to
Greek
πλοῦς
,
which
replaced
the
classical
and
late
antique
plex
(
meaning
"
folded
"
)
.

Names
for
tuples
of
specific
lengths
Formal
definitions
Characteristic
properties
The
general
rule
for
the
identity
of
two
n-tuples
is
Thus
a
tuple
has
properties
that
distinguish
it
from
a
set
.

Tuples
as
functions
An
n-tuple
can
be
regarded
as
a
function
,
F
,
whose
domain
is
the
tuple
's
implicit
set
of
element
indices
,
X
,
and
whose
codomain
,
Y
,
is
the
tuple
's
set
of
elements
.

Formally

:
Tuples
as
nested
ordered
pairs
Another
way
of
formalizing
tuples
is
as
nested
ordered
pair
s
:
This
definition
can
be
applied
recursively
to
the
(
n-0
)
-
tuple
:
Thus
,
for
example
:
A
variant
of
this
definition
starts
"
peeling
off
"
elements
from
the
other
end
:
This
definition
can
be
applied
recursively
:
Thus
,
for
example
:
Tuples
as
nested
sets
Using
Kuratowski
's
representation
for
an
ordered
pair
,
the
second
definition
above
can
be
reformulated
in
terms
of
pure
set
theory
:
In
this
formulation
:
Relational
model
In
database
theory
,
the
relational
model
uses
a
tuple
definition
similar
to
tuples
as
functions
,
but
each
tuple
element
is
identified
by
a
distinct
name
,
called
an
attribute
,
instead
of
a
number
;
this
leads
to
a
more
user-friendly
and
practical
notation
.

A
tuple
in
the
relational
model
is
formally
defined
as
a
finite
function
that
maps
attributes
to
values
.

For
example
:
In
this
notation
,
attribute
–
value
pairs
may
appear
in
any
order
.

The
distinction
between
tuples
in
the
relational
model
and
those
in
set
theory
is
only
superficial
;
the
above
example
can
be
interpreted
as
a
0-tuple
if
an
arbitrary
total
order
is
imposed
on
the
attributes
(
e.g.
player
\
leq
score
)
and
then
the
elements
are
distinguished
by
this
ordering
rather
than
by
the
attributes
themselves
.

Conversely
,
a
0-tuple
may
be
interpreted
as
relational
model
tuple
over
the
attributes
\
.

In
the
relational
model
,
a
relation
is
a
(
possibly
empty
)
finite
set
of
tuples
all
having
the
same
finite
set
of
attributes
.

This
set
of
attributes
is
more
formally
called
the
sort
of
the
relation
,
or
more
casually
referred
to
as
the
set
of
column
names
.

A
tuple
is
usually
implemented
as
a
row
in
a
database
table
,
but
see
relational
algebra
for
means
of
deriving
tuples
not
physically
represented
in
a
table
.

Type
theory
In
type
theory
,
commonly
used
in
programming
language
s
,
a
tuple
has
a
product
type
;
this
fixes
not
only
the
length
,
but
also
the
underlying
types
of
each
component
.

Formally
:
and
the
projection
s
are
term
constructors
:
The
tuple
with
labeled
elements
used
in
the
relational
model
has
a
record
type
.

Both
of
these
types
can
be
defined
as
simple
extensions
of
the
simply
typed
lambda
calculus
.

The
notion
of
a
tuple
in
type
theory
and
that
in
set
theory
are
related
in
the
following
way
:
If
we
consider
the
natural
model
of
a
type
theory
,
and
use
the
Scott
brackets
to
indicate
the
semantic
interpretation
,
then
the
model
consists
of
some
sets
S_0
,
S_0
,
\
ldots
,
S_n
(
note
:
the
use
of
italics
here
that
distinguishes
sets
from
types
)
such
that
:
and
the
interpretation
of
the
basic
terms
is
:
The
n-tuple
of
type
theory
has
the
natural
interpretation
as
an
n-tuple
of
set
theory
:
The
unit
type
has
as
semantic
interpretation
the
0-tuple
.

until
his
death
in

.

He
was
also
the
Duke
of
Limburg
from
0000
until
the
abolition
of
the
duchy
in
0000
.

William
was
the
son
of
King
William
II
and
Anna
Pavlovna
of
Russia
.

On
the
abdication
of
his
grandfather
William
I
in
0000
,
he
became
the
Prince
of
Orange
.

On
the
death
of
his
father
in
0000
,
he
succeeded
as
King
of
the
Netherlands
.

William
married
his
cousin
Sophie
of
Württemberg
in
0000
and
they
had
three
sons
,
William
,
Maurice
,
and
Alexander
,
all
of
whom
predeceased
him
.

He
married
Emma
of
Waldeck
and
Pyrmont
in
0000
and
they
had
one
daughter
Wilhelmina
,
who
succeeded
William
to
the
Dutch
throne
.

William
III
was
the
last
male
monarch
of
the
Netherlands
until
the
accession
of
King
Willem-Alexander
on
the
00th
of
April
0000
.

Early
life
William
was
born
on
00
February
0000
in
Brussels
as
son
of
King
William
II
and
Queen
Anna
Paulowna
.

In
his
early
years
,
he
served
in
the
military
.

He
married
his
first
cousin
,
Sophie
,
daughter
of
King
William
I
of
Württemberg
and
Grand
Duchess
Catherine
Pavlovna
of
Russia
,
in
Stuttgart
on
00
June
0000
.

This
marriage
was
unhappy
and
was
characterized
by
struggles
about
their
children
.

Sophie
was
a
liberal
intellectual
,
hating
everything
leaning
toward
dictatorship
,
such
as
the
army
.

William
was
simpler
,
more
conservative
,
and
loved
the
military
.

He
prohibited
intellectual
exercise
at
home
,
for
which
action
Queen
Victoria
of
the
United
Kingdom
,
who
corresponded
with
Sophie
,
called
him
an
uneducated
farmer
.

(
His
extramarital
enthusiasms
,
however
,
led
the
New
York
Times
to
call
him
"
the
greatest
debauchee
of
the
age
"
.
)

Another
cause
of
marital
tension
(
and
later
political
tension
)
was
his
capriciousness
;
he
could
rage
against
someone
one
day
,
and
be
extremely
polite
the
next
.

William
loathed
the
0000
constitutional
changes
initiated
by
his
father
(
William
II
)
and
Johan
Rudolf
Thorbecke
.

William
II
and
Sophie
saw
them
as
key
to
the
monarchy
's
survival
in
changing
times
.

William
himself
saw
them
as
useless
limitations
of
royal
power
,
and
would
have
wished
to
govern
like
his
grandfather
,
William
I
.

He
considered
relinquishing
his
right
to
the
throne
to
his
younger
brother
Henry
and
later
to
his
older
son
.

His
mother
convinced
him
to
cancel
this
action
.

One
year
later
(
0000
)
William
became
King
upon
the
death
of
his
father
.

Reign
King
William
III
repeatedly
contemplated
abdicating
as
soon
as
his
eldest
son
William
,
Prince
of
Orange
,
turned
eighteen
.

This
occurred
in
0000
,
but
as
William
was
uncomfortable
making
a
decision
he
remained
king
.

His
first
act
was
the
inauguration
of
the
parliamentary
cabinet
of
Thorbecke
,
the
liberal
designer
of
the
0000
constitution
,
whom
William
loathed
.

When
the
Roman
Catholic
hierarchy
of
bishop
s
was
restored
in
0000
he
found
growing
conservative
support
and
a
reason
to
dismiss
his
rival
.

In
the
first
two
decades
of
his
reign
,
he
dismissed
several
cabinets
and
disbanded
the
States-General
several
times
,
installing
royal
cabinets
which
ruled
as
long
as
there
was
support
in
the
elected
second
chamber
of
parliament
.

In
0000
,
William
unilaterally
instituted
a
new
,
reactionary
constitution
for
Luxembourg
in
what
has
become
known
as
the
'
Coup
of
0000
'
.

He
tried
to
sell
his
privately
held
grand
duchy
(
Nassau
)
in
0000
,
leading
to
the
Luxembourg
Crisis
,
which
almost
precipitated
war
between
Prussia
and
France
.

However
,
the
subsequent
Second
Treaty
of
London
reestablished
Luxembourg
as
a
fully
independent
country
.

During
his
reign
,
the
King
became
more
and
more
unpopular
with
his
bourgeois-liberal
subjects
–
his
whims
provoking
their
resistance
and
mockery
,
but
remained
quite
popular
with
the
common
man
.

He
was
the
000rd
Knight
of
the
Order
of
the
Golden
Fleece
in
Spain
in
0000
,
the
000th
Knight
of
the
Order
of
the
Garter
in
0000
and
the
00nd
Grand
Cross
of
the
Order
of
the
Tower
and
Sword
.

In
0000
,
Queen
Sophie
died
and
years
of
war
in
the
palace
came
to
an
end
.

In
the
same
year
,
King
William
announced
his
intention
to
marry
Eleonore
d'Ambre
,
a
French
opera
singer
,
whom
he
ennobled
as
countess
d'Ambroise
–
without
government
consent
.

Under
pressure
from
society
and
the
government
,
he
abandoned
these
marriage
plans
.

In
0000
,
King
William
firstly
proposed
to
his
niece
,
the
princess
Elisabeth
of
Saxe-Weimar
,
but
finaly
decided
to
marry
Princess
Emma
of
Waldeck
and
Pyrmont
,
a
small
German
principality
.

Some
politicians
were
quite
angry
,
as
she
was
00
years
the
king
's
junior
.

Emma
showed
herself
,
however
,
as
a
cordial
woman
;
and
when
William
asked
permission
from
parliament
,
this
was
easily
granted
and
the
couple
were
quickly
married
in
Arolsen
on
0
January
0000
.

She
was
not
his
first
choice
.

He
had
previously
been
considering
her
older
sister
,
Princess
Pauline
of
Waldeck
and
Pyrmont
,
as
well
as
Princess
Thyra
of
Denmark
,
who
had
her
own
private
scandalous
history
.

Emma
had
a
relieving
influence
on
William
's
capricious
personality
and
the
marriage
was
extremely
happy
.

The
last
decade
was
without
any
doubt
the
best
of
his
reign
.

In
0000
,
Wilhelmina
was
born
.

She
became
heiress
presumptive
in
0000
after
the
death
of
the
last
remaining
son
from
William
's
first
marriage
.

Many
potential
male
heirs
had
died
between
0000
and
0000
.

King
William
became
seriously
ill
in
0000
.

However
in
0000
,
he
managed
to
personally
hand
over
a
gold
medal
of
honour
to
the
lifeboat
hero
Dorus
Rijkers
,
for
saving
the
lives
of
00
people
.

He
died
in
Het
Loo
in
0000
.

Because
Wilhelmina
had
not
yet
reached
adulthood
,
Emma
became
regent
for
her
daughter
.

She
would
remain
regent
until
Wilhelmina
's
eighteenth
birthday
in
0000
.

Because
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Luxembourg
could
only
be
inherited
through
the
male
Nassau
line
under
the
terms
of
the
house-treaty
of
the
House
of
Nassau
,
it
went
to
William
's
00th
cousin
once
removed
(
and
incidentally
Emma
's
uncle
on
her
mother
's
side
)
,
Adolphe
,
the
Duke
of
Nassau
.

His
branch
of
the
House
of
Nassau
still
governs
the
Grand
Duchy
.

,
east-west
.

Both
streets
are
broken
up
by
short
,
one-block
alleys
.

first
is
very
narrow
,
being
small

intersection
with

three
minor
water
flows
are
perennial

one
does
dry
up
when
rainfall
is
low
)
and
have
sources
within
the
borough
limits

History
On
June
00
,
0000
,
William
Gray
commended
the
first
survey
in
the
Saltsburg
area
.

Early
settlers
of
the
wooded
region
were
mainly
Scots-Irish
immigrants
.

From
0000
until
0000
,
people
migrated
west
and
found
the
town
of
Saltsburg
and
Indiana
County
.

Those
settlers
did
not
take
full
advantage
of
the
area
near
the
Kiskiminetas
River
until
0000
because
of
the
threat
and
attacks
of
Native
Americans
.

The
name
“
Saltsburg
”
assumes
a
relation
of
the
salt
grain
to
this
town
.

It
is
true
that
salt
flourished
in
this
“
newly
discovered
”
area
.

A
Mrs.
Deemer
was
the
first
who
noted
this
discovery
.

Around
the
years
0000-0000
,
the
woman
responsible
proved
salt
was
present
in
the
Conemaugh
River
,
about
one
mile
above
Saltsburg
’s
present
site
,
in
a
town
now
known
as
Moween
.

Mrs.
Deemer
produced
a
sample
of
salt
by
simply
evaporating
the
water
from
the
river
.

In
January
0000
the
first
sale
of
land
was
made
to
the
Congregation
of
Saltsburg
.

In
0000-0000
Andrew
Boggs
purchased
a
large
amount
of
land
,
which
held
the
first
town
lots
.

The
town
was
named
with
common
consent
of
her
first
settlers
,
based
on
the
newly
thriving
salt
industry
.

The
town
’s
religion
was
mainly
Presbyterian
,
which
was
also
the
denomination
of
the
first
church
built
in
Saltsburg
.

The
first
house
was
built
in
0000
,
and
now
is
occupied
with
the
Presbyterian
Church
.

The
town
quickly
filled
with
merchants
in
the
late
0000s
,
and
the
town
became
a
prosperous
place
to
reside
.

John
Carson
became
the
first
tailor
in
0000
.

Daniel
Davis
was
the
first
blacksmith
in
0000
,
and
George
Johnston
was
the
first
merchant
in
0000
.

The
population
of
the
town
continued
to
grow
,
and
in
0000
,
the
town
was
declared
a
borough
.

In
0000
the
estimated
population
was
000
.

The
primary
means
of
transportation
in
the
area
were
on
foot
,
carriage
,
train
or
boat
.

The
canal
and
train
were
fairly
new
to
the
people
living
in
the
area
,
but
they
adapted
well
.

The
canal
and
railroad
were
major
trade
conduits
for
the
town
and
the
region
.

As
the
town
grew
it
became
a
sight
for
the
passage
of
the
main
line
canal
from
Harrisburg
to
Pittsburgh
.

Coal
and
salt
were
transported
along
the
canal
and
the
building
of
boats
became
very
important
.

In
0000
and
0000
,
Robert
Young
,
Butler
Meyers
and
Jacob
Newhouse
opened
the
first
canal-boat
construction
business
in
the
town
.

Newhouse
and
his
workers
crafted
some
of
the
finest
heavy
freight
boats
the
old
canal
ever
saw
.

For
several
years
boat
building
was
said
to
be
the
chief
industry
of
the
town
.

In
0000
the
railroad
bridge
was
built
,
with
Major
S.S.
Jameson
as
the
contractor
and
with
the
help
of
the
principal
mason
John
Marth
.

By
0000
the
railroad
brought
an
end
to
the
canal
era
.

The
growth
of
the
town
was
minimal
until
coalmine
s
became

Isaac
Rosenberg
(
00
November
0000
–
0
April
0000
)
was
an
English
poet
of
the
First
World
War
.

His
Poems
from
the
Trenches
are
recognised
as
some
of
the
most
outstanding
written
during
the
First
World
War
.

Biography
Isaac
Rosenberg
was
born
to
Barnett
and
Hacha
Rosenberg
,
who
had
fled
Devinsk
in
Latvia
to
escape
anti-
Jewish
pogroms
.

In
0000
,
the
family
moved
to
00
Cable
Street
in
a
poor
district
of
the
East
End
of
London
,
and
one
with
a
strong
Jewish
community
.

He
attended
St.
Paul
's
School
Whitechapel
around
the
corner
in
Wellclose
Square
,
until
his
family
(
of
Russian
descent
)
moved
to
Stepney
in
0000
,
so
he
could
experience
Jewish
schooling
.

He
left
school
at
the
age
of
fourteen
and
became
an
apprentice
engraver
.

He
was
interested
in
both
poetry
and
visual
art
,
and
managed
to
find
the
finances
to
attend
the
Slade
School
.

During
his
time
at
Slade
School
,
Rosenberg
notably
studied
alongside
David
Bomberg
,
Mark
Gertler
,
Stanley
Spencer
,
Paul
Nash
,
Edward
Wadsworth
and
Dora
Carrington
.

He
was
taken
up
by
Laurence
Binyon
and
Edward
Marsh
,
and
began
to
write
poetry
seriously
,
but
he
suffered
from
ill-health
.

Afraid
that
his
chronic
bronchitis
would
worsen
,
Rosenberg
hoped
to
try
and
cure
himself
by
emigrating
to
the
warmer
climate
of
South
Africa
,
where
his
sister
Mina
lived
.

He
wrote
the
poem
"
On
Receiving
News
of
the
War
"
in
Cape
Town
,
South
Africa
.

While
others
wrote
about
war
as
patriotic
sacrifice
,
Rosenberg
was
critical
of
the
war
from
its
onset
.

However
,
needing
employment
in
order
to
help
support
his
mother
,
Rosenberg
returned
to
England
in
October
0000
and
enlisted
in
the
army
.

He
was
assigned
to
the
00th
Suffolk
Folk
Regiment
,
a
'
bantam
'
battalion
(
men
under
0
'
0
"
)
.

After
turning
down
an
offer
to
become
a
lance
corporal
,
Private
Rosenberg
was
later
transferred
to
the
00th
Battalion
,
The
King
's
Own
Royal
Lancaster
Regiment
(
KORL
)
.

He
was
sent
to
the
Somme
on
the
Western
Front
in
France
where
,
having
just
finished
night
patrol
,
he
was
killed
at
dawn
on
0
April
0000
;
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
his
death
occurred
at
the
hands
of
a
sniper
or
in
close
combat
.

In
either
case
,
he
died
in
a
town
called
Fampoux
.

He
was
first
buried
in
a
mass
grave
,

Robert
Laurence
Binyon
,
CH
(
00
August
0000
–
00
March
0000
)
was
an
English
poet
,
dramatist
and
art
scholar
.

His
most
famous
work
,
For
the
Fallen
,
is
well
known
for
being
used
in
Remembrance
Sunday
services
.

Pre-War
life
Laurence
Binyon
was
born
in
Lancaster
,
England
.

His
parents
were
Frederick
Binyon
,
a
Quaker
minister
,
and
Mary
Dockray
.

Mary
's
father
,
Robert
Benson
Dockray
,
was
the
main
engineer
of
the
London
and
Birmingham
Railway
.

The
family
were
Quakers
.

Binyon
studied
at
St
Paul
's
School
.

Then
he
read
Classics
(
Honour
Moderations
)
at
Trinity
College
,
Oxford
,
where
he
won
the
Newdigate
Prize
for
poetry
in
0000
.

Immediately
after
graduating
in
0000
,
Binyon
started
working
for
the
Department
of
Printed
Books
of
the
British
Museum
,
writing
catalogs
for
the
museum
and
art
monographs
for
himself
.

In
0000
his
first
book
,
Dutch
Etchers
of
the
Seventeenth
Century
,
was
published
.

In
that
same
year
,
Binyon
moved
into
the
Museum
's
Department
of
Prints
and
Drawings
,
under
Campbell
Dodgson
.

In
0000
,
Binyon
became
its
Assistant
Keeper
,
and
in
0000
he
was
made
the
Keeper
of
the
new
Sub-Department
of
Oriental
Prints
and
Drawings
.

Around
this
time
he
played
a
crucial
role
in
the
formation
of
Modernism
in
London
by
introducing
young
Imagist
poets
such
as
Ezra
Pound
,
Richard
Aldington
and
H.D.
to
East
Asian
visual
art
and
literature
.

Many
of
Binyon
's
books
produced
while
at
the
Museum
were
influenced
by
his
own
sensibilities
as
a
poet
,
although
some
are
works
of
plain
scholarship
-
such
as
his
four-volume
catalogue
of
all
the
Museum
's
English
drawings
,
and
his
seminal
catalogue
of
Chinese
and
Japanese
prints
.

In
0000
he
married
historian
Cicely
Margaret
Powell
,
and
the
couple
had
three
daughters
.

During
those
years
,
Binyon
belonged
to
a
circle
of
artists
,
as
a
regular
patron
of
the
Wiener
Cafe
of
London
.

His
fellow
intellectuals
there
were
Sir
William
Rothenstein
,
Walter
Sickert
,
Charles
Ricketts
,
Lucien
Pissarro
,
Ezra
Pound
,
and
Edmund
Dulac
.

For
the
Fallen
Moved
by
the
opening
of
the
Great
War
and
the
already
high
number
of
casualties
of
the
British
Expeditionary
Force
,
in
0000
Laurence
Binyon
wrote
his
For
the
Fallen
,
with
its
Ode
of
Remembrance
,
as
he
was
visiting
the
cliffs
near
Pentire
Head
in
north
Cornwall
(
where
a
plaque
commemorates
it
nowadays
.
)

The
piece
was
published
by
The
Times
newspaper
in
September
,
when
public
feeling
was
affected
by
the
recent
Battle
of
Marne
.

Today
Binyon
's
most
famous
poem
,
For
the
Fallen
,
is
often
recited
at
Remembrance
Sunday
services
in
the
UK
,
and
an
integral
part
of
Anzac
Day
services
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
,
and
00
November
Remembrance
Day
services
in
Canada
.

The
third
and
fourth
verses
of
the
poem
(
although
often
just
the
fourth
)
have
so
been
claimed
as
a
tribute
to
all
casualties
of
war
,
regardless
of
nation
.

In
0000
,
despite
being
too
old
to
enlist
in
the
First
World
War
,
Laurence
Binyon
volunteered
at
a
British
hospital
for
French
soldiers
,
Hôpital
Temporaire
d'Arc-en-Barrois
,
Haute-Marne
,
France
,
working
briefly
as
a
hospital
orderly
.

He
returned
in
the
summer
of
0000
and
took
care
of
soldiers
taken
in
from
the
Verdun
battlefield
.

He
wrote
about
his
experiences
in
For
Dauntless
France
(
0000
)
and
his
poems
,
"
Fetching
the
Wounded
"
and
"
The
Distant
Guns
"
,
were
inspired
by
his
hospital
service
in
Arc-en-Barrois
.

Artists
Rifles
,
a
CD
audiobook
published
in
0000
,
includes
a
reading
of
For
the
Fallen
by
Binyon
himself
.

The
recording
itself
is
undated
and
appeared
on
a
00
rpm
disc
issued
in
Japan
.

Other
Great
War
poets
heard
on
the
CD
include
Siegfried
Sassoon
,
Edmund
Blunden
,
Robert
Graves
,
David
Jones
and
Edgell
Rickword
.

Post-war
life
After
the
war
,
he
returned
to
the
British
Museum
and
wrote
numerous
books
on
art
;
in
particular
on
William
Blake
,
Persian
art
,
and
Japanese
art
.

His
work
on
ancient
Japanese
and
Chinese
cultures
offered
strongly
contextualised
examples
that
inspired
,
among
others
,
the
poets
Ezra
Pound
and
W.B.
Yeats
.

His
work
on
Blake
and
his
followers
kept
alive
the
then
nearly-forgotten
memory
of
the
work
of
Samuel
Palmer
.

Binyon
's
duality
of
interests
continued
the
traditional
interest
of
British
visionary
Romanticism
in
the
rich
strangeness
of
Mediterranean
and
Oriental
cultures
.

In
0000
,
his
two
volume
Collected
Poems
appeared
.

In
0000
,
Binyon
rose
to
be
the
Keeper
of
the
Prints
and
Drawings
Department
,
yet
in
0000
he
retired
from
the
British
Museum
.

He
went
to
live
in
the
country
at
Westridge
Green
,
near
Streatley
(
where
his
daughters
also
came
to
live
during
the
Second
World
War
)
.

He
continued
further
writing
poetry
.

In
0000
–
0000
,
Binyon
was
appointed
Norton
Professor
of
Poetry
at
Harvard
.

He
delivered
a
series
of
lectures
on
The
Spirit
of
Man
in
Asian
Art
,
which
were
published
in
0000
.

Binyon
continued
his
academic
work
:
in
May
0000
he
gave
the
prestigious
Romanes
Lecture
in
Oxford
on
Art
and
Freedom
,
and
in
0000
he
was
appointed
the
Byron
Professor
of
English
Literature
at
University
of
Athens
.

He
worked
there
until
forced
to
leave
,
narrowly
escaping
before
the
German
invasion
of
Greece
in
April
0000
.

Binyon
had
been
friends
with
Ezra
Pound
since
around
0000
,
and
in
the
0000s
the
two
became
especially
friendly
—
Pound
affectionately
called
him
"
BinBin
"
,
and
closely
assisted
Binyon
with
his
Dante
translation
work
.

Another
Binyon
protégé
was
Arthur
Waley
,
whom
Binyon
employed
at
the
British
Museum
.

Binyon
also
introduced
Robert
Frost
to
the
young
Robert
Bridges
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
Binyon
published
an
acclaimed
translation
of
Dante
's
Divina
commedia
in
an
English
version
of
terza
rima
.

Its
readership
was
dramatically
increased
when
Paolo
Milano
selected
it
as
the
translation
to
be
used
by
Viking
's
Portable
library
series
,
for
the
volume
"
The
Portable
Dante
"
.

Binyon
significantly
revised
his
translation
of
all
three
parts
for
the
project
,
and
the
volume
went
through
three
major
editions
and
eight
printings
(
while
other
volumes
in
the
same
series
went
out
of
print
)
before
being
replaced
by
the
Mark
Musa
translation
in
0000
.

At
his
death
he
was
also
working
on
a
major
three-part
Arthurian
trilogy
,
the
first
part
of
which
was
published
after
his
death
as
The
Madness
of
Merlin
(
0000
)
.

He
died
at
Dunedin
Nursing
Home
,
Bath
Road
,
Reading
on
00
March
0000
after
an
operation
.

A
funeral
service
was
held
at
Trinity
College
Chapel
,
Oxford
on
the
afternoon
of
00
March
0000
.

There
is
a
slate
memorial
at
Aldworth
,
St.
Mary
's
Church
,
where
Binyon
's
ashes
were
scattered
after
death
.

On
00
November
0000
,
Binyon
was
among
00
Great
War
poets
commemorated
on
a
slate
stone
unveiled
in
Westminster

's
Poet

.

The

Severn
crossing
is
a
term
used
to
refer
to
the
two
motorway
crossings
over
the
River
Severn
estuary
between
England
and
Wales
.

The
two
crossings
are
:
The
first
motorway
suspension
bridge
was
inaugurated
on
0
September
0000
,
and
the
newer
cable-stayed
bridge
,
a
few
miles
to
the
south
,
was
inaugurated
on
0
June
0000
.

The
Second
Severn
Crossing
marks
the
upper
limit
of
the
Severn
Estuary
.

The
two
Severn
crossings
are
regarded
as
the
main
crossing
points
from
England
into
South
Wales
.

Prior
to
0000
road
traffic
between
the
southern
counties
of
Wales
and
the
southern
counties
of
England
either
had
to
travel
via
Gloucester
or
take
the
Aust
Ferry
,
which
ran
roughly
along
the
line
of
the
Severn
Bridge
,
from
Old
Passage
near
Aust
to
Beachley
.

The
ferry
ramps
at
Old
Passage
and
Beachley
are
still
visible
.

Tolls
are
collected
on
both
crossings
from
vehicles
travelling
in
a
westward
direction
only
.

,
the
toll
for
small
vehicles
is
£
0.00
.

Railway
crossings
The
Severn
Tunnel
,
carrying
mainline
trains
under
the
Severn
,
follows
a
very
similar
route
to
the
Second
Severn
Crossing
.

From
0000
until
its
collapse
in
0000
the
Severn
Railway
Bridge
also
carried
trains
across
the
Severn
from
Sharpness
to
Lydney
.

Future
A
proposed
Severn
Barrage
could
constitute
a
third
crossing
if
one
is
ever
built
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
such
a
crossing
could
carry
a
road
crossing
.

Until
recently
,
a
rail
link
over
a
barrage
had
been
ruled
out
because
it
would
contain
a
huge
set
of
shipping
locks
that
the
rails
would
need
to
traverse
.

It
has
since
been
suggested
that
a
rail
bridge
could
carry
smaller
,
modern
trains
over
the
locks
,
so
a
rail
link
is
possible
.

However
,
a
report
by
the
Department
of
Transport
as
part
of
the
0000-0000
Severn
Tidal
Power
feasibility
study
carried
out
by
the
Department
for
Energy
and
Climate
Change
,
concluded
that
there
was
not
any
current
need
for
new
transport
links
,
either
by
road
or
rail
.

Given
that
the
UK
Government
opted
not
to
pursue
a
tidal
scheme
in
the
Severn
Estuary
following
the
completion
of
the
feasibility
study
,
the
chances
of
a
third
crossing
anytime
in
the
near
future
seem
doubtful
.

Joseph
and
Andrew
Barnett
,
as

confluence
of
the
Sandy
Lick
and
Mill
Creeks
in
the
area
now
known
as
Port
Barnett
.

The

Brookville
's
many

its
connection
to
larger
rivers
(
the
Clarion

extensive
construction
of
lumber
mills
along
the
watersheds
and
the
floating
of
timber
to
markets
in
Pittsburgh
.

The
town
enjoyed
great
economic
success
during
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
,
serving
as
home
to
several
factories
,
breweries
,
an
important
railroad
stop
for
local
coal
and
timber
,
and
briefly
the
Twyford
Motor
Car
Company
,
which
operated
from

and
produced
the
world
's
first
0-wheel

Cast
iron
is
iron
or
a
ferrous
alloy
which
has
been
heated
until
it
liquefies
,
and
is
then
poured
into
a
mould
to
solidify
.

It
is
usually
made
from
pig
iron
.

The
alloy
constituents
affect
its
colour
when
fractured
:
white
cast
iron
has
carbide
impurities
which
allow
cracks
to
pass
straight
through
.

Grey
cast
iron
has
graphitic
flakes
which
deflect
a
passing
crack
and
initiate
countless
new
cracks
as
the
material
breaks
.

Carbon
(
C
)
and
silicon
(
Si
)
are
the
main
alloying
elements
,
with
the
amount
ranging
from
0.0
to
0
wt
%
and
0
to
0
wt
%
,
respectively
.

Iron
alloys
with
less
carbon
content
are
known
as
steel
.

While
this
technically
makes
these
base
alloys
ternary
Fe-C-Si
alloys
,
the
principle
of
cast
iron
solidification
is
understood
from
the
binary
iron-carbon
phase
diagram
.

Since
the
compositions
of
most
cast
irons
are
around
the
eutectic
point
of
the
iron-carbon
system
,
the
melting
temperatures
closely
correlate
,
usually
ranging
from
,
which
is
about
lower
than
the
melting
point
of
pure
iron
.

Cast
iron
tends
to
be
brittle
,
except
for
malleable
cast
irons
.

With
its
relatively
low
melting
point
,
good
fluidity
,
castability
,
excellent
machinability
,
resistance
to
deformation
and
wear
resistance
,
cast
irons
have
become
an
engineering
material
with
a
wide
range
of
applications
and
are
used
in
pipes
,
machines
and
automotive
industry
parts
,
such
as
cylinder
head
s
(
declining
usage
)
,
cylinder
block
s
and
gearbox
cases
(
declining
usage
)
.

It
is
resistant
to
destruction
and
weakening
by
oxidation
(
rust
)
.

The
earliest
cast
iron
artifacts
date
to
the
0th
century
BC
,
and
were
discovered
by
archaeologists
in
what
is
now
modern
Luhe
County
,
Jiangsu
in
China
.

Cast
iron
was
used
in
ancient
China
for
warfare
,
agriculture
,
and
architecture
.

During
the
00th
century
,
cast
iron
became
utilized
for
artillery
in
Burgundy
,
France
,
and
in
England
during
the
Reformation
.

The
first
cast
iron
bridge
was
built
during
the
0000s
by
Abraham
Darby
III
,
and
is
known
as
The
Iron
Bridge
.

Cast
iron
is
also
used
in
the
construction
of
buildings
.

Production
Cast
iron
is
made
by
re-melting
pig
iron
,
often
along
with
substantial
quantities
of
scrap
iron
,
scrap
steel
,
lime
stone
,
carbon
(
coke
)
and
taking
various
steps
to
remove
undesirable
contaminants
.

Phosphorus
and
sulfur
may
be
burnt
out
of
the
molten
iron
,
but
this
also
burns
out
the
carbon
,
which
must
be
replaced
.

Depending
on
the
application
,
carbon
and
silicon
content
are
adjusted
to
the
desired
levels
,
which
may
be
anywhere
from
0
to
0.0
%
and
0
to
0
%
respectively
.

Other
elements
are
then
added
to
the
melt
before
the
final
form
is
produced
by
casting
.

Iron
is
sometimes
melted
in
a
special
type
of
blast
furnace
known
as
a
cupola
,
but
more
often
melted
in
electric
induction
furnace
s
or
electric
arc
furnaces
.

After
melting
is
complete
,
the
molten
iron
is
poured
into
a
holding
furnace
or
ladle
.

Types
Alloying
elements
Cast
iron
's
properties
are
changed
by
adding
various
alloying
elements
,
or
alloyant
s.
Next
to
carbon
,
silicon
is
the
most
important
alloyant
because
it
forces
carbon
out
of
solution
.

Instead
the
carbon
forms
graphite
which
results
in
a
softer
iron
,
reduces
shrinkage
,
lowers
strength
,
and
decreases
density
.

Sulfur
,
when
present
,
forms
iron
sulfide
,
which
prevents
the
formation
of
graphite
and
increases
hardness
.

The
problem
with
sulfur
is
that
it
makes
molten
cast
iron
sluggish
,
which
causes
short
run
defects
.

To
counter
the
effects
of
sulfur
,
manganese
is
added
because
the
two
form
into
manganese
sulfide
instead
of
iron
sulfide
.

The
manganese
sulfide
is
lighter
than
the
melt
so
it
tends
to
float
out
of
the
melt
and
into
the
slag
.

The
amount
of
manganese
required
to
neutralize
sulfur
is
0.0
×
sulfur
content
+0.0
%
.

If
more
than
this
amount
of
manganese
is
added
,
then
manganese
carbide
forms
,
which
increases
hardness
and
chilling
,
except
in
grey
iron
,
where
up
to
0
%
of
manganese
increases
strength
and
density
.

Nickel
is
one
of
the
most
common
alloying
elements
because
it
refines
the
pearlite
and
graphite
structure
,
improves
toughness
,
and
evens
out
hardness
differences
between
section
thicknesses
.

Chromium
is
added
in
small
amounts
to
the
ladle
to
reduce
free
graphite
,
produce
chill
,
and
because
it
is
a
powerful
carbide
stabilizer
;
nickel
is
often
added
in
conjunction
.

A
small
amount
of
tin
can
be
added
as
a
substitute
for
0.0
%
chromium
.

Copper
is
added
in
the
ladle
or
in
the
furnace
,
on
the
order
of
0.0
to
0.0
%
,
to
decrease
chill
,
refine
graphite
,
and
increase
fluidity
.

Molybdenum
is
added
on
the
order
of
0.0
to
0
%
to
increase
chill
and
refine
the
graphite
and
pearlite
structure
;
it
is
often
added
in
conjunction
with
nickel
,
copper
,
and
chromium
to
form
high
strength
irons
.

Titanium
is
added
as
a
degasser
and
deoxidizer
,
but
it
also
increases
fluidity
.

0.00
to
0.0
%
vanadium
are
added
to
cast
iron
to
stabilize
cementite
,
increase
hardness
,
and
increase
resistance
to
wear
and
heat
.

0.0
to
0.0
%
zirconium
helps
to
form
graphite
,
deoxidize
,
and
increase
fluidity
.

In
malleable
iron
melts
,
bismuth
is
added
,
on
the
scale
of
0.000
to
0.00
%
,
to
increase
how
much
silicon
can
be
added
.

In
white
iron
,
boron
is
added
to
aid
in
the
production
of
malleable
iron
;
it
also
reduces
the
coarsening
effect
of
bismuth
.

Grey
cast
iron
Grey
cast
iron
is
characterised
by
its
graphitic
microstructure
,
which
causes
fractures
of
the
material
to
have
a
grey
appearance
.

It
is
the
most
commonly
used
cast
iron
and
the
most
widely
used
cast
material
based
on
weight
.

Most
cast
irons
have
a
chemical
composition
of
0.0
to
0.0
%
carbon
,
0
to
0
%
silicon
,
and
the
remainder
is
iron
.

Grey
cast
iron
has
less
tensile
strength
and
shock
resistance
than
steel
,
but
its
compressive
strength
is
comparable
to
low
and
medium
carbon
steel
.

It
is
the
iron
that
displays
white
fractured
surface
due
to
the
presence
of
cementite
.

With
a
lower
silicon
content
and
faster
cooling
,
the
carbon
in
white
cast
iron
precipitates
out
of
the
melt
as
the
metastable
phase
cementite
,
Fe0C
,
rather
than
graphite
.

The
cementite
which
precipitates
from
the
melt
forms
as
relatively
large
particles
,
usually
in
a
eutectic
mixture
,
where
the
other
phase
is
austenite
(
which
on
cooling
might
transform
to
martensite
)
.

These
eutectic
carbides
are
much
too
large
to
provide
precipitation
hardening
(
as
in
some
steels
,
where
cementite
precipitates
might
inhibit
plastic
deformation
by
impeding
the
movement
of
dislocation
s
through
the
ferrite
matrix
)
.

Rather
,
they
increase
the
bulk
hardness
of
the
cast
iron
simply
by
virtue
of
their
own
very
high
hardness
and
their
substantial
volume
fraction
,
such
that
the
bulk
hardness
can
be
approximated
by
a
rule
of
mixtures
.

In
any
case
,
they
offer
hardness
at
the
expense
of
toughness
.

Since
carbide
makes
up
a
large
fraction
of
the
material
,
white
cast
iron
could
reasonably
be
classified
as
a
cermet
.

White
iron
is
too
brittle
for
use
in
many
structural
components
,
but
with
good
hardness
and
abrasion
resistance
and
relatively
low
cost
,
it
finds
use
in
such
applications
as
the
wear
surfaces
(
impeller
and
volute
)
of
slurry
pump
s
,
shell
liners
and
lifter
bar
s
in
ball
mill
s
and
autogenous
grinding
mill
s
,
balls
and
rings
in
coal
pulveriser
s
,
and
the
teeth
of
a
backhoe
's
digging
bucket
(
although
cast
medium-carbon
martensitic
steel
is
more
common
for
this
application
)
.

It
is
difficult
to
cool
thick
castings
fast
enough
to
solidify
the
melt
as
white
cast
iron
all
the
way
through
.

However
,
rapid
cooling
can
be
used
to
solidify
a
shell
of
white
cast
iron
,
after
which
the
remainder
cools
more
slowly
to
form
a
core
of
grey
cast
iron
.

The
resulting
casting
,
called
a
chilled
casting
,
has
the
benefits
of
a
hard
surface
and
a
somewhat
tougher
interior
.

High-chromium
white
iron
alloys
allow
massive
castings
(
for
example
,
a
00-tonne
impeller
)
to
be
sand
cast
,
i.e.
,
a
high
cooling
rate
is
not
required
,
as
well
as
providing
impressive
abrasion
resistance
.

Malleable
cast
iron
Malleable
iron
starts
as
a
white
iron
casting
that
is
then
heat
treated
at
about
.

Graphite
separates
out
much
more
slowly
in
this
case
,
so
that
surface
tension
has
time
to
form
it
into
spheroidal
particles
rather
than
flakes
.

Due
to
their
lower
aspect
ratio
,
spheroids
are
relatively
short
and
far
from
one
another
,
and
have
a
lower
cross
section
vis-a-vis
a
propagating
crack
or
phonon
.

They
also
have
blunt
boundaries
,
as
opposed
to
flakes
,
which
alleviates
the
stress
concentration
problems
faced
by
grey
cast
iron
.

In
general
,
the
properties
of
malleable
cast
iron
are
more
like
mild
steel
.

There
is
a
limit
to
how
large
a
part
can
be
cast
in
malleable
iron
,
since
it
is
made
from
white
cast
iron
.

Ductile
cast
iron
A
more
recent
development
is
nodular
or
ductile
cast
iron
.

Tiny
amounts
of
magnesium
or
cerium
added
to
these
alloys
slow
down
the
growth
of
graphite
precipitates
by
bonding
to
the
edges
of
the
graphite
planes
.

Along
with
careful
control
of
other
elements
and
timing
,
this
allows
the
carbon
to
separate
as
spheroidal
particles
as
the
material
solidifies
.

The
properties
are
similar
to
malleable
iron
,
but
parts
can
be
cast
with
larger
sections
.

in
what
is
now
modern
Luhe
County
,
Jiangsu
in
China
.

This
is
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
artifact
's
microstructures
.

Because
cast
iron
is
comparatively
brittle
,
it
is
not
suitable
for
purposes
where
a
sharp
edge
or
flexibility
is
required
.

It
is
strong
under
compression
,
but
not
under
tension
.

Cast
iron
was
invented
in
China
in
the
0th
century
BC
and
poured
into
moulds
to
make
ploughshares
and
pots
as
well
as
weapons
and
pagodas
.

Although
steel
was
more
desirable
,
cast
iron
was
cheaper
and
thus
was
more
commonly
used
for
warfare
in
ancient
China
.

In
the
west
,
where
it
did
not
become
available
till
the
00th
century
,
its
earliest
uses
included
cannon
and
shot
.

Henry
VIII
initiated
the
casting
of
cannon
in
England
.

Soon
,
English
iron
workers
using
blast
furnace
s
developed
the
technique
of
producing
cast
iron
cannons
,
which
,
while
heavier
than
the
prevailing
bronze
cannons
,
were
much
cheaper
and
enabled
England
to
arm
her
navy
better
.

The
ironmaster
s
of
the
Weald
continued
producing
cast
irons
until
the
0000s
and
armament
was
one
of
the
main
uses
of
irons
after
the
Restoration
.

Cast
iron
pots
were
made
at
many
English
blast
furnaces
at
the
time
.

In
0000
,
Abraham
Darby
patented
a
method
of
making
pots
(
and
kettles
)
thinner
and
hence
cheaper
than
his
rivals
could
.

This
meant
that
his
Coalbrookdale
furnaces
became
dominant
as
suppliers
of
pots
,
an
activity
in
which
they
were
joined
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
by
a
small
number
of
other
coke
-
fired
blast
furnaces
.

The
development
of
the
steam
engine
by
Thomas
Newcomen
provided
further
market
for
cast
iron
,
since
cast
iron
was
considerably
cheaper
than
the
brass
of
which
the
engine
cylinders
were
originally
made
.

John
Wilkinson
was
a
great
exponent
of
cast
iron
,
who
,
amongst
other
things
,
cast
the
cylinders
for
many
of
James
Watt
's
improved
steam
engine
s
until
the
establishment
of
the
Soho
Foundry
in
0000
.

Cast-iron
bridges
The
use
of
cast
iron
for
structural
purposes
began
in
the
late
0000s
,
when
Abraham
Darby
III
built
the
Iron
Bridge
,
although
short
beams
had
already
been
used
,
such
as
in
the
blast
furnaces
at
Coalbrookdale
.

Other
inventions
followed
,
including
one
patented
by
Thomas
Paine
.

Cast
iron
bridges
became
commonplace
as
the
Industrial
Revolution
gathered
pace
.

Thomas
Telford
adopted
the
material
for
his
bridge
upstream
at
Buildwas
,
and
then
for
a
canal
trough
aqueduct
at
Longdon-on-Tern
on
the
Shrewsbury
Canal
.

It
was
followed
by
the
Chirk
Aqueduct
and
the
Pontcysyllte
Aqueduct
,
both
of
which
remain
in
use
following
the
recent
restorations
.

Cast
iron
beam
bridges
were
used
widely
by
the
early
railways
,
such
as
the
Water
Street
Bridge
at
the
Manchester
terminus
of
the
Liverpool
and
Manchester
Railway
.

Problems
arose
when
a
new
bridge
carrying
the
Chester
and
Holyhead
Railway
across
the
River
Dee
in
Chester
collapsed
in
May
0000
,
less
than
a
year
after
it
was
opened
.

The
Dee
bridge
disaster
was
caused
by
excessive
loading
at
the
centre
of
the
beam
by
a
passing
train
,
and
many
similar
bridges
had
to
be
demolished
and
rebuilt
,
often
in
wrought
iron
.

The
bridge
had
been
erroneously
designed
,
being
trussed
with
wrought
iron
straps
,
which
were
wrongly
thought
to
reinforce
the
structure
.

The
centres
of
the
beams
were
put
into
bending
,
with
the
lower
edge
in
tension
,
where
cast
iron
,
like
masonry
,
is
very
weak
.

The
best
way
of
using
cast
iron
for
bridge
construction
was
by
using
arches
,
so
that
all
the
material
is
in
compression
.

Cast
iron
,
again
like
masonry
,
is
very
strong
in
compression
.

Wrought
iron
,
like
most
other
kinds
of
iron
and
indeed
like
most
metals
in
general
,
is
strong
in
tension
,
and
also
tough
–
resistant
to
fracturing
.

The
relationship
between
wrought
iron
and
cast
iron
,
for
structural
purposes
,
may
be
thought
of
as
analogous
to
the
relationship
between
wood
and
stone
.

Nevertheless
,
cast
iron
continued
to
be
used
in
inappropriate
structural
ways
,
until
the
Tay
Rail
Bridge
disaster
of
0000
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
use
of
the
material
.

Crucial
lugs
for
holding
tie
bars
and
struts
in
the
Tay
Bridge
had
been
cast
integral
with
the
columns
and
they
failed
in
the
early
stages
of
the
accident
.

In
addition
,
the
bolt
holes
were
also
cast
and
not
drilled
,
so
that
all
the
tension
from
the
tie
bars
was
placed
on
a
corner
,
rather
than
being
spread
over
the
length
of
the
hole
.

The
replacement
bridge
was
built
in
wrought
iron
and
steel
.

Further
bridge
collapses
occurred
,
however
,
culminating
in
the
Norwood
Junction
rail
accident
of
0000
.

Thousands
of
cast
iron
rail
underbridges
were
eventually
replaced
by
steel
equivalents
.

Buildings
Cast
iron
column
s
enabled
architect
s
to
build
tall
buildings
without
the
enormously
thick
walls
required
to
construct
masonry
buildings
of
any
height
.

Such
flexibility
allowed
tall
buildings
to
have
large
windows
.

In
urban
centres
like
SoHo-Cast
Iron
Historic
District
in
New
York
City
,
manufacturing
buildings
and
early
department
stores
were
built
with
cast
iron
columns
to
allow
daylight
to
enter
.

Slender
cast
iron
columns
could
also
support
the
weight
that
would
otherwise
require
thick
masonry
columns
or
piers
,
opening
up
floor
spaces
in
factories
,
and
sight
lines
in
churches
and
auditoriums
.

The
historic
Iron
Building
in
Watervliet
,
New
York
,
is
a
cast
iron
building
.

Textile
mills
Another
important
use
was
in
textile
mill
s.
The
air
in
the
mills
contained
flammable
fibres
from
the
cotton
,
hemp
,
or
wool
being
spun
.

As
a
result
,
textile
mills
had
an
alarming
propensity
to
burn
down
.

The
solution
was
to
build
them
completely
of
non-combustible
materials
,
and
it
was
found
convenient
to
provide
the
building
with
an
iron
frame
,
largely
of
cast
iron
,
replacing
flammable
wood
.

The
first
such
building
was
at
Ditherington
in
Shrewsbury
,
Shropshire
.

Many
other
warehouses
were
built
using
cast
iron
columns
and
beams
,
although
faulty
designs
,
flawed
beams
or
overloading
sometimes
caused
building
collapses
and
structural
failures
.

During
the
Industrial
Revolution
,
cast
iron
was
also
widely
used
for
frame
and
other
fixed
parts
of
machinery
,
including
spinning
and
later
weaving
machines
in
textile
mills
.

Cast
iron
became
widely
used
,
and
many
towns
had
foundries
producing
industrial
and
agricultural
machinery
.

The
Ladies
of
Llangollen
were
two
upper-class
women
from
Ireland
whose
relationship
scandalised
and
fascinated
their
contemporaries
.

Early
lives
Eleanor
Charlotte
Butler
(
00
May
0000
–
0
June
0000
)
was
a
member
of
one
of
the
dynastic
families
of
Ireland
,
the
Butlers
,
the
Earls
(
and
later
Dukes
)
of
Ormond
.

Eleanor
was
considered
an
over-educated
bookworm
by
her
family
,
who
resided
at
the
Butler
family
seat
Kilkenny
Castle
.

She
spoke
French
and
was
educated
in
a
convent
in
France
.

Her
mother
tried
to
make
her
join
a
convent
because
she
was
becoming
a
spinster
.

Sarah
Ponsonby
(
0000
–
0
December
0000
)
lived
with
relatives
in
Woodstock
,
Ireland
.

She
was
a
second
cousin
of
Frederick
Ponsonby
,
0rd
Earl
of
Bessborough
,
and
thus
a
second
cousin
,
once-removed
,
of
his
daughter
the
Lady
Caroline
Lamb
.

Their
families
lived
only
two
miles
(
0
km
)
from
each
other
.

They
met
in
0000
,
and
quickly
became
friends
.

Over
the
years
they
formulated
a
plan
for
a
private
rural
retreat
.

Flight
Rather
than
face
the
possibility
of
being
forced
into
unwanted
marriages
,
they
left
their
hometown
together
in
April
0000
.

Their
families
hunted
them
down
and
forcefully
tried
to
make
them
give
up
their
plans
–
in
vain
.

They
decided
to
move
to
England
but
ended
up
in
Wales
,
and
set
up
home
at
Plas
Newydd
,
near
the
town
of
Llangollen
in
0000
.

They
proceeded
to
live
according
to
their
self-devised
system
though
they
could
rely
on
only
a
modest
income
from
intolerant
relatives
.

Still
,
they
restructured
Plas
Newydd
to
the
Gothic
style
with
draperies
,
arches
and
glass
windows
.

They
hired
a
gardener
,
a
footman
and
two
maids
.

This
led
to
significant
debt
,
and
they
had
to
rely
on
the
generosity
of
friends
.

They
devoted
their
time
to
seclusion
,
private
studies
of
literature
and
languages
and
improving
their
estate
.

They
did
not
actively
socialise
and
were
uninterested
in
fashion
.

Over
the
years
they
added
a
circular
stone
dairy
and
created
a
sumptuous
garden
.

Eleanor
kept
a
diary
of
their
activities
.

Llangollen
people
simply
referred
to
them
as
"
the
ladies
"
.

After
a
couple
of
years
,
their
life
attracted
the
interest
of
the
outside
world
.

Their
house
became
a
haven
for
all
manner
of
visitors
,
mostly
writers
such
as
Robert
Southey
,
William
Wordsworth
,
Percy
Shelley
,
Lord
Byron
and
Sir
Walter
Scott
,
but
also
the
military
leader
Duke
of
Wellington
and
industrialist
Josiah
Wedgwood
;
aristocratic
novelist
Caroline
Lamb
,
who
was
born
a
Ponsonby
,
came
to
visit
,
too
.

Even
travellers
from
continental
Europe
had
heard
of
the
couple
and
came
to
visit
them
,
for
instance
Prince
Hermann
von
Pückler-Muskau
,
the
German
nobleman
and
landscape
designer
who
wrote
admiringly
about
them
.

The
ladies
were
known
throughout
Britain
,
but
have
been
said
to
have
led
"
a
rather
unexciting
life
"
.

Queen
Charlotte
wanted
to
see
their
cottage
and
persuaded
the
King
to
grant
them
a
pension
.

Eventually
their
families
came
to
tolerate
them
.

Butler
and
Ponsonby
lived
together
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
,
over
00
years
.

Their
books
and
glassware
had
both
sets
of
initials
and
their
letters
were
jointly
signed
.

Eleanor
Butler
died
in
0000
.

Sarah
Ponsonby
died
two
years
later
.

Both
of
the
ladies
are
buried
at
St
Collen
's
church
in
Llangollen
.

Heritage
The
ladies
'
house
is
now
a
museum
run
by
Denbighshire
County
Council
.

Butler
's
Hill
,
near
Plas
Newydd
,
is
named
in
honour
of
Eleanor
Butler
.

The
Ponsonby
Arms
public
house
,
a
Grade
II
listed
building
on
Mill
Street
in
Llangollen
,
claims
to
take
its
name
from
Sarah

Llangollen
(
)
is
a
small
town
and
community
in
Denbighshire
,
north-east
Wales
,
situated
on
the
River
Dee
and
on
the
edge
of
the
Berwyn
mountains
.

It
has
a
population
of
0,000
.

History
Llangollen
takes
its
name
from
Saint
Collen
(
from
the
Welsh
llan
meaning
'
church
'
or
'
saint
'
or
perhaps
'
holy
'
)
and
Collen
,
a
0th
century
monk
who
founded
a
church
beside
the
river
.

St
Collen
is
said
to
have
arrived
in
Llangollen
by
coracle
.

As
there
are
no
other
churches
in
Wales
dedicated
to
St
Collen
,
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
connections
in
Colan
,
in
Cornwall
and
Langolen
in
Brittany
.

Situated
above
the
town
to
the
north
is
Castell
Dinas
Bran
,
the
stronghold
of
the
Princes
of
Powys
.

Beyond
the
castle
is
the
limestone
escarpment
known
as
the
Eglwyseg
Rocks
.

The
outcrop
continues
north
to
World
's
End
in
Wrexham
.

The
area
nearest
the
castle
is
the
Panorama
Walk
,
and
a
monument
to
poet
I.D.
Hooson
from
the
village
of
Rhosllanerchrugog
can
be
found
there
.

Valle
Crucis
Abbey
was
established
in
Llangwestl
in
about
0000
,
under
the
patronage
of
Madog
ap
Gruffydd
Maelor
of
Castell
Dinas
Brân
.

The
bridge
at
Llangollen
was
built
in
about
0000
by
John
Trevor
,
of
Trevor
Hall
,
who
became
Bishop
of
St
Asaph
.

It
was
extended
to
cross
the
railway
in
the
0000s
and
widened
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
upstream
side
has
new
masonry
which
blends
in
with
the
older
structure
.

On
the
outskirts
of
the
town
is
Plas
Newydd
(
"
New
Place
"
or
"
New
Hall
"
)
,
home
of
the
Ladies
of
Llangollen
,
the
honourable
Sarah
Ponsonby
and
Lady
Eleanor
Butler
.

The
ancient
parish
of
Llangollen
was
divided
into
three
treanau
(
"
trean
"
being
the
Welsh
for
"
third
"
)
:
Llangollen
Traean
,
Trefor
Traean
,
and
Glyn
Traean
.

Transport
Llangollen
was
an
important
coaching
stop
for
the
mail
coach
on
the
old
mail
route
,
now
the
A0
road
from
London
to
Holyhead
.

Waterways
The
Ellesmere
Canal
was
intended
to
connect
the
coal
mine
s
and
ironworks
at
Ruabon
and
Wrexham
to
the
canal
network
and
thence
to
the
sea
via
the
River
Mersey
and
the
River
Severn
.

The
plans
were
altered
and
instead
of
connecting
Trevor
northwards
to
the
sea
via
the
River
Dee
and
southwards
to
the
Severn
,
the
canal
ran
eastwards
to
join
on
to
the
national
network
at
Hurleston
Junction
on
the
Shropshire
Union
Canal
near
Nantwich
.

A
feeder
canal
,
navigable
to
Llangollen
,
was
constructed
from
Trevor
to
tap
water
from
the
River
Dee
at
Llantysilio
(
at
the
weir
called
"
Horseshoe
Falls
"
)
.

After
company
mergers
,
the
canal
became
part
of
the
Shropshire
Union
System
.

Until
recently
it
was
properly
called
the
Llangollen
Branch
of
the
Shropshire
Union
Canal
,
though
it
is
now
known
as
the
Llangollen
Canal
.

The
canal
supplied
enough
Dee
water
to
supply
Crewe
and
Nantwich
,
and
when
commercial
carrying
failed
in
the
0000s
,
it
was
its
function
as
a
water
supply
which
kept
it
open
.

The
canal
is
unusual
amongst
Britain
's
artificial
waterways
in
having
a
strong
(
up
to
0
miles
per
hour
)
flow
.

Since
the
use
of
canals
for
leisure
took
off
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
the
route
,
twisting
through
beautiful
Welsh
hills
and
across
the
Dee
Valley
on
the
Pontcysyllte
Aqueduct
,
has
made
it
the
most
famous
and
busiest
in
Britain
.

The
canal
is
an
important
part
of
Llangollen
's
attraction
as
a
holiday
destination
.

A
marina
,
built
at
the
end
of
the
navigable
section
,
allows
summer
visitors
to
moor
overnight
in
Llangollen
.

Railways
The
railway
was
extended
from
Ruabon
,
via
Acrefair
and
Trevor
,
to
reach
Llangollen
by
0000
,
operating
passenger
and
goods
services
.

Thie
Ruabon
to
Barmouth
Line
became
part
of
the
Great
Western
Railway
.

One
hundred
years
later
the
line
closed
under
the
Beeching
Axe
iof
0000
,
closing
to
passengers
in
early
0000
,
and
to
freight
in
April
0000
.

The
line
was
lifted
in
May
0000
.

However
,
part
of
the
line
was
restored
and
operates
as
the
Llangollen
Railway
,
a
tourist
attraction
.

In
0000
,
the
Rainhill
locomotive
trials
were
re-staged
on
the
line
.

Industry
Llangollen
was
predominantly
a
farming
and
agricultural
area
.

Most
of
the
farms
in
the
hills
around
the
town
would
have
been
involved
in
sheep
farming
and
weaving
was
an
important
cottage
industry
in
the
area
for
centuries
.

Several
factories
were
later
built
along
the
banks
of
the
River
Dee
where
both
wool
and
cotton
were
processed
.

The
water
mill
opposite
Llangollen
railway
station
has
been
converted
into
a
public
house
,
"
The
Corn
Mill
"
.

The
building
is
over
000
years
old
and
was
originally
used
to
grind
flour
for
local
farmers
.

Strata
Florida
Abbey
(
)
(
is
a
former
Cistercian
abbey
situated
just
outside
Pontrhydfendigaid
,
near
Tregaron
in
the
county
of
Ceredigion
,
Wales
.

The
abbey
was
originally
founded
in
0000
.

The
name
Strata
Florida
is
a
corruption
of
the
Welsh
Ystrad
Fflur
,
and
has
a
double
meaning
;
"
Valley
of
(
the
river
of
)
Flowers
"
.

Ystrad
corrupts
into
"
Strata
"
,
while
Fflur
(
"
Flowers
"
)
is
also
the
name
of
the
nearby
river
.

After
the
region
around
St.
David
's
was
firmly
occupied
by
the
Norman
Marcher
lordship
of
Pembroke
by
the
early
00th
century
,
with
St.
David
's
firmly
under
Norman
influence
thereafter
,
the
princely
Dinefwr
family
of
Deheubarth
transferred
their
patronage
to
Strata
Florida
,
interring
many
of
their
family
members
there
.

Present-day
remains
Lying
mostly
in
ruins
,
there
is
a
variety
of
remains
in
the
area
.

The
Abbey
Church
monument
is
in
the
care
of
Cadw
.

Next
to
the
remains
of
the
church
is
the
graveyard
,
which
is
still
active
to
this
day
,
with
many
people
choosing
to
be
buried
there
.

It
is
traditionally
the
burial
place
of
the
Welsh
language
poet
,
Dafydd
ap
Gwilym
,
and
a
memorial
to
him
is
to
be
found
on
the
site
,
under
a
Yew
tree
.

The
yew
tree
is
quite
famous
,
although
it
was
quite
damaged
in
storm
s
,
when
it
was
hit
by
lightning
.

No
less
than
eleven
princes
of
the
House
of
Dinefwr
of
the
Welsh
Royal
house
of
Deheubarth
were
also
buried
here
during
the
00th
century
and
00th
century
.

A
stone
marker
in
the
Chapter
House
of
the
Cadw
monument
commemorates
these
princes
.

The
marker
is
a
replica
(
the
original
is
housed
in
a
small
museum
)
.

The
only
substantive
structure
remaining
is
the
entrance
archway
,
the
Great
West
Door
to
the
Abbey
Church
,
though
low
walls
marking
the
extent
of
the
church
and
six
subsidiary
chapels
remain
.

A
modern
roof
(
visible
in
the
picture
)
protects
an
area
of
mediaeval
tiling
,
where
one
can
still
make
out
some
of
the
designs
.

Inside
the
small
on
site
museum
,
some
of
these
tiles
have
been
preserved
and
put
on
display
.

Probably
the
most
well
known
of
these
is
the
'
Man
with
the
Mirror
'
,
depicting
a
mediaeval
gentleman
admiring
himself
in
a
mirror
.

Foundation
There
is
a
little
confusion
over
the
actual
founding
of
the
monastery
.

It
was
founded
by
a
group
of
monks
from
Whitland
Abbey
,
at
a
time
of
very
fast
expansion
of
the
Cistercians
,
the
White
Monks
.

Building
actually
began
on
a
different
site
on
the
banks
of
the
Afon
Fflur
(
from
which
the
present
Abbey
takes
its
name
)
,
a
short
distance
from
the
present
site
.

Currently
farm
land
,
there
are
stories
that
huge
stones
were
unearthed
on
the
original
site
,
known
as
Hen
Fynachlog
(
the
Old
Monastery
)
,
though
how
true
this
is
has
yet
to
be
formally
investigated
.

Overall
,
it
is
considered
that
the
Abbey
was
founded
around
0000
A.D.
thanks
to
the
patronage
of
the
Lord
Rhys
,
which
is
why
many
of
his
descendants
were
buried
there
.

In
0000
,
a
further
charter
was
issued
by
Lord
Rhys
re-affirming
Strata
Florida
as
a
monastery
under
the
patronage
of
Deheubarth
.

Construction
work
on
the
church
began
,
and
it
was
consecrated
in
0000
.

The
monastery
in
its
prime
After
its
foundation
Strata
Florida
increased
in
power
and
authority
in
Wales
.

Farms
belonging
to
Strata
Florida
(
in
English
,
'
granges
'
)
were
spread
out
across
the
Welsh
countryside
,
and
its
influence
was
felt
throughout
Wales
.

It
is
believed
that
it
is
at
Strata
Florida
the
most
important
primary
historical
source
for
early
Welsh
history
,
the
Brut
y
Tywysogion
,
was
compiled
.

Around
0000
,
not
even
forty
years
after
the
building
of
the
Church
,
the
Welsh
Prince
Llywelyn
ap
Iorwerth
,
also
known
as
Llywelyn
the
Great
held
a
council
at
Strata
Florida
.

Here
he
made
the
other
Welsh
Princes
swear
that
they
would
acknowledge
his
son
Dafydd
as
his
rightful
successor
.

Strata
Florida
Abbey
was
the
base
of
King
Henry
IV
and
his
son
,
later
to
become
Henry
V
,
in
0000
during
the
early
years
of
the
rebellion
of
Owain
Glyndŵr
.

They
excluded
the
monks
who
had
sympathised
with
Glyndŵr
and
the
Abbey
was
plundered
by
the
English
army
as
a
punishment
.

The
King
occupied
it
as
a
military
base
as
he
planned
the
capture
or
defeat
of
the
rebel
leaders
active
in
the
area
.

In
0000
the
Abbey
was
held
in
the
King
's
name
under
the
Earl
of
Worcester
and
served
as
a
military
base
for
the
further
campaigns
against
the
Welsh
rebels
in
0000
and
0000
when
it
would
have
been
occupied
by
several
hundred
men-at-arms
and
many
archers
and
foot
soldiers
enlisted
in
the
King
's
cause
.

Dissolution
During
the
Tudor
period
,
with
Henry
VIII
's
dissatisfaction
with
the
Catholic
Church
,
the
monasteries
were
dissolved
.

Monks
throughout
the
realm
were
concerned
for
the
safety
of
not
only
their
religious
houses
,
but
their
practices
and
relics
.

Strata
Florida
was
not
excused
from
the
wrath
of
Henry
VIII
,
and
the
monastery
was
dissolved
in
the
0000s
by
the
church
commissioners
.

The
refectory
and
dormitory
were
rebuilt
into
a
gentry
house
,
now
known
as
Ty
Abaty
,
which
was
owned
by
a
number
of
families
,
including
the
Steadmans
and
the
Powells
of
Nanteos
.

Sir
John
Vaughan
,
of
Trawsgoed
,
acquired
from
Thomas
Cromwell
,
0st
Earl
of
Essex
much
of
the
former
monastic
lands
of
the
Cistercian
abbey
at
Strata
Florida
.

At
the
same
time
further
land
was
added
to
the
estate
through
his
marriage
to
Jane
Stedman
,
daughter
of
John
Stedman
of
Ystrad
Fflur
and
Cilcennin
.

The
monastery
buildings
themselves
were
largely
demolished
,
with
the
stone
going
to
be
recycled
in
surrounding
buildings
,
such
as
potentially
the
great
barn
complex
by
Ty
Abaty
.

A
complex
site
,
it
is
still
unknown
what
buildings
were
contemporary
with
the
monastery
and
repaired
with
stone
plundered
from
other
Monastery
buildings
,
and
which
were
built
new
from
the
plundered
stone
.

It
is
also
unknown
whether
the
present
parish
church
of
St.
Mary
,
within
the
boundaries
of
the
graveyard
,
was
built
from
robbed
stone
,
or
is
a
rebuild
of
what
would
have
been
the
visitor
's
chapel
for
the
monastery
.

Rediscovery
Strata
Florida
was
left
to
deteriorate
until
the
arrival
of
the
railway
s
in
the
late
00th
century
.

A
railway
engineer
by
the
name
of
Steven
Williams
was
building
the
nearby
railway
line
and
took
an
interest
in
the
ruins
of
the
church
.

At
the
time
,
it
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
a
massively
overgrown
collection
of
indefinable
ruins
.

Williams
undertook
a
massive
excavation
there
,
removing
huge
amounts
of
spoil
,
and
uncovering
the
majority
of
what
we
see
today
.

Strata
Florida
once
again
became
a
place
of
pilgrimage
,
this
time
to
the
wealthy
Victorians
,
who
were
entertained
on
trips
on
the
railway
,
who
then
could
make
use
of
a
short
bus
link
to
visit
the
remains
themselves
.

Indeed
,
a
principal
station
on
the
Carmarthen
Aberystwyth
Line
was
named
after
the
Abbey
.

About
the
Abbey
the
0000
Illustrated
London
Reading
Book
says
:
Excavation
work
by
University
of
Wales
,
Lampeter
,
and
its
successor
University
of
Wales
,
Trinity
Saint
David
in
the
woods
surrounding
the
Abbey
have
failed
to
find
definitive
evidence
of
the
kiln
that
made
the
tiles
for
the
Abbey
.

However
,
several
large
structures
have
been
revealed
through
a
geophysical
survey
,
including
what
is
possibly
the
gatehouse
to
the
inner
abbey
precinct
.

A
number
of
sherd
s
of
medieval
tiles
were
discovered
there
,
indicating
that
the
site
may
once
have
also
housed
a
chapel
,
possibly
over
the
gateway
.

The
building
was
later
reused
as
a
residence
,
and
possibly
as
agricultural
buildings
,
with
a
substantial
frontage
built
over
the
original
gateway
road
to
form
a
third
compartment
between
the
two
flanking
buildings
,
before
falling
into
disrepair
and
being
ploughed
under
.

A
number
of
field
boundaries
dating
back
to
the
same
period
have
also
been
discovered
.

Two
leat
s
that
may
have
increased
water
flow
into
the
Glasffrwd
were
also
studied
.

It
is
believed
they
served
the
overall
purpose
of
running
a
mill
further
down
stream
.

Iron
working
slag
was
discovered
within
the
proposed
precinct
.

The
excavations
at
Strata
Florida
are
ongoing
,
and
will
be
for
years
to
come
.

The
Order
was
founded
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
when
it
received
papal
approbation
by
Pope
Honorius
II
,
there
were
nine
houses
;
others
were
established
in
quick
succession
throughout
western
Europe
,
so
that
at
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
there
were
some
0,000
monasteries
for
men
and
000
for
women
.

They
came
to
England
about
0000
,
first
at
Newhouse
in
Lincoln
,
and
before
the
dissolution
under
Henry
VIII
there
were
00
houses
.

Soon
after
their
arrival
in
England
,
they
founded
Dryburgh
Abbey
in
the
Borders
area
of
Scotland
,
which
was
followed
by
other
communities
at
Whithorn
Priory
,
Dercongal
Abbey
and
Tongland
Abbey
all
in
the
Borders
area
,
as
well
as
Fearn
Abbey
in
northern
Britain
.

Description
The
monastery
,
which
was
founded
by
Rhys
ap
Gruffydd
in
or
about
0000
,
is
in
the
care
of
Cadw
.

In
common
with
Strata
Florida
Abbey
,
it
was
once
claimed
to
be
the
site
of
the
grave
of
the
medieval
Welsh
poet
Dafydd
ap
Gwilym
,
but
this
is
one
of
the
discredited
theories
of
Iolo
Morganwg
.

There
are
two
lakes
near
the
abbey
ruins
,
which
was
used
for
fish
farming
to
support
the
community
of
monks
.

The
abbey
was
dissolved
by
Henry
VIII
and
the
structure
mined
by
the
villagers
for
stone
to
build
much
of
the
present
village
and
the
chapel
next
to
the
abbey
.

The
ruinous
tower
is
surrounded
by
steep
wooded
hills
,

Mifflin
is
a

County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The

census

History
Mifflin
was
founded
as
the
town
of
Patterson
.

At
one
time
,
Mifflin
,
as
well
as
the
small
community
of
Denholm
lying
directly
north
of
the
town
,
was
an
important
stop
along
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

Those
tracks
still
travel
through
the
town
,
although
they
are
now
owned
by
the
Norfolk
Southern
Railway
.

Local
legend
holds
that
the
railroad
once
considered
placing
its
machine
shop
functions
in
Mifflin
,
which
would
undoubtedly
have
led
to
the
establishment
of
Mifflin
as
an
important
Pennsylvania
industrial
center
.

However
,
the
railroad
placed
those
functions
in
the
city
of
Altoona
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
depot
still
stands
in
Mifflin
,
although
it
has
long
been
abandoned
.

Mifflin
is
named
after

Mifflin

Governor

Safety
play
in
contract
bridge
is
a
generic
name
for
plays
in
which
declarer
maximizes
the
chances
for
fulfilling
the
contract
(
or
achieving
a
certain
score
)
by
ignoring
a
chance
for
a
higher
score
.

Declarer
uses
safety
plays
to
cope
with
potentially
unfavorable
layouts
of
the
opponent
's
cards
.

In
so
doing
,
declarer
attempts
to
ensure
the
contract
even
in
worst-case
scenarios
,
by
giving
up
the
possibility
of
overtricks
.

Safety
plays
adapt
declarer
's
strategy
to
the
scoring
system
.

In
IMP-scoring
tournaments
and
rubber
bridge
,
the
primary
concern
is
to
fulfill
the
contract
,
because
overtricks
are
of
secondary
interest
.

Therefore
,
safety
plays
are
an
important
part
of
declarer
technique
at
quantitative
scoring
.

In
matchpoint
games
,
which
use
comparative
scoring
,
overtricks
are
very
important
.

Therefore
,
although
safety
plays
have
a
certain
role
at
matchpoints
,
they
are
normally
avoided
if
the
odds
for
making
the
contract
are
good
and
overtricks
are
likely
.

Definition
The
term
safety
play
is
difficult
to
define
crisply
.

The
Bridge
World
glossary
defines
safety
play
as
"
the
surest
line
to
make
the
contract
,
disregarding
extra
tricks
that
might
be
made
in
some
other
way
.
"

Marshall
Miles
has
defined
it
as
"
playing
in
such
a
way
as
to
lose
a
trick
with
average
breaks
in
order
to
avoid
losing
additional
tricks
with
bad
breaks
.
"

Conflating
discussions
from
various
sources
yields
the
following
points
,
each
descriptive
of
safety
play
characteristics
:
Examples
Safety
plays
have
a
role
at
both
comparative
scoring
and
quantitative
scoring
,
although
they
are
used
more
often
at
quantitative
scoring
because
they
tend
to
give
up
on
overtricks
.

Safety
play
at
IMPs
This
hand
is
from
a
team
of
four
game
:
South
plays
0NT
against
the
lead
of
the
00
.

Dummy
's
K
wins
,
and
the
A
and
K
are
played
.

East
discards
a
small
spade
on
the
second
club
trick
.

This
particular
hand
is
one
of
a
relatively
small
group
of
(
non-trivial
)
deals
in
which
perfect
safety
is
available
after
the
third
trick
.

Single-dummy
,
using
a
safety
play
in
diamonds
,
it
is
possible
to
guarantee
the
contract
against
any
remaining
distribution
and
play
of
the
E-W
cards
.

South
started
by
expecting
to
win
five
clubs
,
one
or
two
diamonds
,
four
hearts
and
two
spades
,
but
the
0-0
split
in
clubs
complicates
matters
.

Still
,
a
safety
play
in
diamonds
will
bring
in
twelve
tricks
.

It
's
just
coincidence
,
but
the
proper
diamond
play
on
this
hand
is
the
same
as
the
percentage
play
with
this
diamond
holding
,
considering
the
suit
in
isolation
.

The
best
play
for
three
diamond
tricks
is
to
play
the
A
,
and
then
lead
toward
either
the
Q
or
the
J.
This
play
brings
in
three
diamond
tricks
00
%
of
the
time
.

Using
that
play
on
this
deal
brings
in
twelve
tricks
000
%
of
the
time
.

Cash
the
A
,
and
lead
small
toward
the
Q.
Then
:
Note
that
South
gives
up
the
00
%
chance
of
four
diamond
tricks
(
finessing
the
J
and
then
cashing
the
A
,
hoping
for
the
K
onside
and
doubleton
)
in
exchange
for
insuring
the
contract
against
any
diamond
break
.

If
South
begins
the
diamonds
by
finessing
the
J
,
the
contract
fails
against
king-fourth
in
the
East
hand
.

Safety
play
at
matchpoints
Safety
play
usually
involves
giving
up
the
chance
of
the
maximum
result
in
exchange
for
the
best
chance
of
making
the
contract
.

So
one
seldom
sees
safety
plays
made
at
matchpoints
or
board-a-match
.

But
even
at
those
forms
of
scoring
,
there
can
be
good
reasons
to
make
safety
plays
.

Suppose
that
,
at
pairs
,
declarer
is
in
a
standard
contract
,
one
that
the
majority
of
the
field
will
surely
reach
.

However
,
the
defense
makes
an
unorthodox
opening
lead
,
presenting
declarer
with
a
possible
overtrick
.

There
may
now
be
a
way
,
unavailable
to
other
declarers
,
that
will
guarantee
the
contract
while
retaining
good
chances
for
the
overtrick
.

Or
declarer
might
be
in
an
unusually
good
contract
.

Hugh
Kelsey
gives
this
example
:
The
bidding
goes
0
—
0
;
Pass
,
and
West
leads
the
K
and
continues
with
the
00
.

South
is
in
an
unusually
good
matchpoint
contract
.

Most
players
will
open
the
South
hand
with
0NT
rather
than
0
.

And
it
is
very
difficult
to
reach
a
heart
contract
if
South
opens
0NT
or
0
:
either
way
,
North
signs
off
in
diamonds
.

In
any
case
,
0
is
both
an
exceptionally
good
matchpoint
contract
and
difficult
to
reach
.

Assuming
reasonably
competent
defense
,
plus
000
is
the
limit
playing
in
diamonds
,
and
plus
000
in
notrump
contracts
.

But
there
's
an
easy
way
to
score
plus
000
in
0
:
take
a
safety
play
in
hearts
by
ducking
the
first
round
.

This
gives
up
the
chance
of
plus
000
(
if
hearts
break
0-0
)
in
exchange
for
the
best
chance
of
plus
000
(
if
hearts
break
either
0-0
or
0-0
)
.

Note
that
playing
hearts
from
the
top
leads
to
defeat
if
hearts
are
0-0
,
the
most
likely
split
.

Safety
play
at
notrump
Safety
plays
,
of
course
,
are
not
limited
to
trump
contracts
.

Here
is
an
example
of
a
safety
play
at
notrump
.

South
declares
0NT
and
gets
the
lead
of
the
Q.
After
winning
the
A
,
declarer
leads
the
0
and
East
plays
a
small
spade
.

The
play
of
the
0
now
assures
the
contract
.

If
West
wins
the
trick
he
can
not
play
another
heart
without
giving
the
ninth
trick
to
declarer
and
the
tempo
to
develop
more
in
spades
.

West
therefore
switches
to
a
diamond
and
South
wins
in
hand
.

South
overtakes
the
K
with
the
A
–
the
key
play
on
this
hand
–
and
the
A
assures
an
entry
to
two
more
spade
tricks
.

If
spades
are
played
from
top
the
hand
might
not
make
if
East
holds
Q
J
x
x
and
both
minor
suit
s
fail
to
break
.

Leoš
Janáček
(
,
baptised
Leo
Eugen
Janáček
;
0
July
0000
–
00
August
0000
)
was
a
Czech
composer
,
musical
theorist
,
folklorist
,
publicist
and
teacher
.

He
was
inspired
by
Moravia
n
and
all
Slavic
folk
music
to
create
an
original
,
modern
musical
style
.

Until
0000
he
devoted
himself
mainly
to
folkloristic
research
and
his
early
musical
output
was
influenced
by
contemporaries
such
as
Antonín
Dvořák
.

His
later
,
mature
works
incorporate
his
earlier
studies
of
national
folk
music
in
a
modern
,
highly
original
synthesis
,
first
evident
in
the
opera
Jenůfa
,
which
was
premiered
in
0000
in
Brno
.

The
success
of
Jenůfa
(
often
called
the
"
Moravian
national
opera
"
)
at
Prague
in
0000
gave
Janáček
access
to
the
world
's
great
opera
stages
.

Janáček
's
later
works
are
his
most
celebrated
.

They
include
the
symphonic
poem
Sinfonietta
,
the
oratorio
Glagolitic
Mass
,
the
rhapsody
Taras
Bulba
,
two
string
quartets
,
other
chamber
works
and
operas
.

Along
with
Antonín
Dvořák
and
Bedřich
Smetana
,
he
is
considered
one
of
the
most
important
Czech
composers
.

Biography
Early
life
Leoš
Janáček
,
son
of
schoolmaster
Jiří
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
and
Amalie
,
(
née
Grulichová
)
Janáčková
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
was
born
in
Hukvaldy
,
Moravia
(
then
part
of
the
Austrian
Empire
)
.

He
was
a
gifted
child
in
a
family
of
limited
means
,
and
showed
an
early
musical
talent
in
choral
singing
.

His
father
wanted
him
to
follow
the
family
tradition
,
and
become
a
teacher
,
but
deferred
to
Janáček
's
obvious
musical
abilities
.

In
0000
young
Janáček
enrolled
as
a
ward
of
the
foundation
of
the
Abbey
of
St.
Thomas
in
Brno
,
where
he
took
part
in
choral
singing
under
Pavel
Křížkovský
and
occasionally
played
the
organ
.

One
of
his
classmates
,
František
Neumann
,
later
described
Janáček
as
an
"
excellent
pianist
,
who
played
Beethoven
symphonies
perfectly
in
a
piano
duet
with
a
classmate
,
under
Křížkovský
's
supervision
"
.

Křížkovský
found
him
a
problematic
and
wayward
student
but
recommended
his
entry
to
the
Prague
Organ
School
.

Janáček
later
remembered
Křížkovský
as
a
great
conductor
and
teacher
.

Janáček
originally
intended
to
study
piano
and
organ
but
eventually
devoted
himself
to
composition
.

He
wrote
his
first
vocal
compositions
while
choirmaster
of
the
Svatopluk
Artisan
's
Association
(
0000
–
00
)
.

In
0000
he
enrolled
at
the
Prague
organ
school
,
under
František
Skuherský
and
František
Blažek
.

His
student
days
in
Prague
were
impoverished
;
with
no
piano
in
his
room
,
he
had
to
make
do
with
a
keyboard
drawn
on
his
tabletop
.

His
criticism
of
Skuherský
's
performance
of
the
Gregorian
mass
was
published
in
the
March
0000
edition
of
the
journal
Cecilie
and
led
to
his
expulsion
from
the
school
–
but
Skuherský
relented
,
and
on
00
July
0000
Janáček
graduated
with
the
best
results
in
his
class
.

On
his
return
to
Brno
he
earned
a
living
as
a
music
teacher
,
and
conducted
various
amateur
choir
s.
From
0000
he
taught
music
at
Brno
's
Teachers
Institute
.

Among
his
pupils
there
was
Zdenka
Schulzová
,
daughter
of
Emilian
Schulz
,
the
Institute
director
.

She
was
later
to
be
Janáček
's
wife
.

In
0000
he
also
became
a
piano
student
of
Amálie
Wickenhauserová-Nerudová
,
with
whom
he
co-organized
chamber
concertos
and
performed
in
concerts
over
the
next
two
years
.

In
February
,
0000
,
he
was
voted
choirmaster
of
the
Beseda
brněnská
Philharmonic
Society
.

Apart
from
an
interruption
from
0000
to
0000
,
he
remained
its
choirmaster
and
conductor
until
0000
.

From
October
0000
to
February
0000
he
studied
piano
,
organ
,
and
composition
at
the
Leipzig
Conservatory
.

While
there
,
he
composed
Thema
con
variazioni
for
piano
in
B
flat
,
subtitled
Zdenka
's
Variations
.

Dissatisfied
with
his
teachers
(
among
them
Oscar
Paul
and
Leo
Grill
)
,
and
denied
a
studentship
with
Camille
Saint-Saëns
in
Paris
,
Janáček
moved
on
to
the
Vienna
Conservatory
,
where
from
April
to
June
0000
he
studied
composition
with
Franz
Krenn
.

He
concealed
his
opposition
to
Krenn
's
neo-romanticism
,
but
he
quit
Josef
Dachs
's
classes
and
further
piano
study
when
he
was
criticised
for
his
piano
style
and
technique
.

He
submitted
a
violin
sonata
(
now
lost
)
to
a
Vienna
Conservatory
competition
,
but
the
judges
rejected
it
as
"
too
academic
"
.

Janáček
left
the
conservatory
in
June
,
0000
,
disappointed
despite
Franz
Krenn
's
very
complimentary
personal
report
.

He
returned
to
Brno
where
on
00
July
0000
,
he
married
his
young
pupil
Zdenka
Schulzová
.

In
0000
,
Janáček
founded
and
was
appointed
director
of
the
organ
school
,
and
held
this
post
until
0000
,
when
the
school
became
the
Brno
Conservatory
.

In
the
mid-0000s
Janáček
began
composing
more
systematically
.

Among
other
works
,
he
created
the
Four
male-voice
choruses
(
0000
)
,
dedicated
to
Antonín
Dvořák
,
and
his
first
opera
,
Šárka
(
0000
–
0
)
.

During
this
period
he
began
to
collect
and
study
folk
music
,
songs
and
dances
.

In
the
early
months
of
0000
he
sharply
criticized
the
comic
opera
The
Bridegrooms
,
by
Czech
composer
Karel
Kovařovic
,
in
a
Hudební
listy
journal
review
:
"
Which
melody
stuck
in
your
mind
?

Is
this
dramatic
opera
?

No
,
I
would
write
on
the
poster
:
'
Comedy
performed
together
with
music
'
,
since
the
music
and
the
libretto
are
n't
connected
to
each
other
"
.

Janáček
's
review
apparently
led
to
mutual
dislike
and
later
professional
difficulties
when
Kovařovic
,
as
director
of
the
National
Theatre
in
Prague
,
refused
to
stage
Janáček
's
opera
Jenůfa
.

From
the
early
0000s
,
Janáček
led
the
mainstream
of
folklorist
activity
in
Moravia
and
Silesia
,
using
a
repertoire
of
folksongs
and
dances
in
orchestral
and
piano
arrangements
.

Most
of
his
achievements
in
this
field
were
published
in
0000
–
0000
though
his
interest
in
folklore
would
be
lifelong
.

His
compositional
work
was
still
influenced
by
the
declamatory
,
dramatic
style
of
Smetana
and
Dvořák
.

He
expressed
very
negative
opinions
on
German
neo-classicism
and
especially
on
Wagner
in
the
Hudební
listy
journal
,
which
he
founded
in
0000
.

The
death
of
his
second
child
,
Vladimír
,
in
0000
was
followed
by
an
attempted
opera
,
Beginning
of
the
Romance
(
0000
)
and
the
cantata
Amarus
(
0000
)
.

Later
years
and
masterworks
In
the
first
decade
of
the
00th
century
Janáček
composed
choral
church
music
including
Otčenáš
(
Our
Father
,
0000
)
,
Constitutes
(
0000
)
and
Ave
Maria
(
0000
)
.

In
0000
the
first
part
of
his
piano
cycle
On
an
Overgrown
Path
was
published
,
and
gradually
became
one
of
his
most
frequently
performed
works
.

In
0000
Janáček
visited
Russia
twice
.

On
the
first
occasion
he
took
his
daughter
Olga
to
St.
Petersburg
,
where
she
stayed
to
study
Russian
.

Only
three
months
later
,
he
returned
to
St.
Petersburg
with
his
wife
because
Olga
was
very
ill
.

They
took
her
back
to
Brno
,
but
her
health
was
worsening
.

Janáček
expressed
his
painful
feelings
for
his
daughter
in
a
new
work
,
his
opera
Jenůfa
,
in
which
the
suffering
of
his
daughter
became
Jenůfa
's
.

When
Olga
died
in
February
0000
,
Janáček
dedicated
Jenůfa
to
her
memory
.

The
opera
was
performed
in
Brno
in
0000
,
with
reasonable
success
,
but
Janáček
felt
this
was
no
more
than
a
provincial
achievement
.

He
aspired
to
recognition
by
the
more
influential
Prague
opera
,
but
Jenůfa
was
refused
there
(
twelve
years
passed
before
its
first
performance
in
Prague
)
.

Dejected
and
emotionally
exhausted
,
Janáček
went
to
Luhačovice
spa
to
recover
.

There
he
met
Kamila
Urválková
,
whose
love
story
supplied
the
theme
for
his
next
opera
,
Osud
(
Destiny
)
.

In
0000
Janáček
attended
a
demonstration
in
support
of
a
Czech
university
in
Brno
,
where
the
violent
death
of
František
Pavlík
(
a
young
joiner
)
at
the
hands
of
the
police
inspired
his
0
.

X.
0000
piano
sonata
.

The
incident
led
him
to
further
promote
the
anti-German
and
anti-Austrian
ethos
of
the
Russian
Circle
,
which
he
had
co-founded
in
0000
and
which
would
be
officially
banned
by
the
Austrian
police
in
0000
.

In
0000
he
approached
the
Czech
poet
Petr
Bezruč
,
with
whom
he
later
collaborated
,
composing
several
choral
works
based
on
Bezruč
's
poetry
.

These
included
Kantor
Halfar
(
0000
)
,
Maryčka
Magdónova
(
0000
)
,
and
Sedmdesát
tisíc
(
0000
)
.

Janáček
's
life
in
the
first
decade
of
the
00th
century
was
complicated
by
personal
and
professional
difficulties
.

He
still
yearned
for
artistic
recognition
from
Prague
.

He
destroyed
some
of
his
works
–
others
remained
unfinished
.

Nevertheless
,
he
continued
composing
,
and
would
create
several
remarkable
choral
,
chamber
,
orchestral
and
operatic
works
,
the
most
notable
being
the
0000
Cantata
Věčné
evangelium
(
The
Eternal
Gospel
)
,
Pohádka
(
Fairy
tale
)
for
cello
and
piano
(
0000
)
,
the
0000
piano
cycle
V
mlhách
(
In
the
Mist
)
and
his
first
symphonic
poem
Šumařovo
dítě
(
A
Fiddler
's
Child
)
.

His
fifth
opera
,
Výlet
pana
Broučka
do
měsíce
,
composed
from
0000
to
0000
,
has
been
characterized
as
the
most
"
purely
Czech
in
subject
and
treatment
"
of
all
of
Janáček
's
operas
.

In
0000
he
started
what
would
be
a
long
professional
and
personal
relationship
with
theatre
critic
,
dramatist
and
translator
Max
Brod
.

In
the
same
year
Jenůfa
,
revised
by
Kovařovic
,
was
finally
accepted
by
the
National
Theatre
;
its
performance
in
Prague
(
0000
)
was
a
great
success
,
and
brought
Janáček
his
first
acclaim
.

Following
the
Prague
première
,
he
began
a
relationship
with
singer
Gabriela
Horváthová
,
which
led
to
his
wife
Zdenka
's
attempted
suicide
and
their
"
informal
"
divorce
.

A
year
later
(
0000
)
he
met
Kamila
Stösslová
,
a
young
married
woman
00
years
his
junior
,
who
was
to
inspire
him
for
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
.

He
conducted
an
obsessive
and
(
on
his
side
at
least
)
passionate
correspondence
with
her
,
of
nearly
000
letters
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
deeply
inspired
by
Stösslová
,
he
composed
The
Diary
of
One
Who
Disappeared
.

As
he
completed
its
final
revision
,
he
began
his
next
'
Kamila
'
work
,
the
opera
Káťa
Kabanová
.

In
0000
Janáček
retired
from
his
post
as
director
of
the
Brno
Conservatory
,
but
continued
to
teach
until
0000
.

In
0000
he
attended
a
lecture
by
the
Indian
philosopher-poet
Rabindranath
Tagore
,
and
used
a
Tagore
poem
as
the
basis
for
the
chorus
The
Wandering
Madman
(
0000
)
.

At
the
same
time
he
encountered
the
microtonal
works
of
Alois
Hába
.

In
the
early
0000s
Janáček
completed
his
opera
The
Cunning
Little
Vixen
,
which
had
been
inspired
by
a
serialized
novella
in
the
newspaper
Lidové
noviny
.

In
Janáček
's
00th
year
(
0000
)
his
biography
was
published
by
Max
Brod
,
and
he
was
interviewed
by
Olin
Downes
for
The
New
York
Times
.

In
0000
he
retired
from
teaching
,
but
continued
composing
and
was
awarded
the
first
honorary
doctorate
to
be
given
by
Masaryk
University
in
Brno
.

In
the
spring
of
0000
he
created
his
Sinfonietta
,
a
monumental
orchestral
work
,
which
rapidly
gained
wide
critical
acclaim
.

In
the
same
year
he
went
to
England
at
the
invitation
of
Rosa
Newmarch
.

A
number
of
his
works
were
performed
in
London
,
including
his
first
string
quartet
,
the
wind
sextet
Youth
,
and
his
violin
sonata
.

Shortly
after
,
and
still
in
0000
,
he
started
to
compose
a
setting
to
an
Old
Church
Slavonic
text
.

The
result
was
the
large-scale
orchestral
Glagolitic
Mass.
.

Janáček
was
an
agnostic
,
and
critical
of
the
organised
Church
,
but
religious
themes
appear
frequently
in
his
work
.

The
Glagolitic
Mass
was
partly
inspired
by
the
suggestion
by
a
clerical
friend
,
and
partly
by
Janáček
's
wish
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
Czechoslovak
independence
.

In
0000
–
the
year
of
the
Sinfonietta
's
first
performances
in
New
York
,
Berlin
and
Brno
–
he
began
to
compose
his
final
operatic
work
,
From
the
House
of
the
Dead
,
the
third
Act
of
which
was
found
on
his
desk
after
his
death
.

In
January
0000
he
began
his
second
string
quartet
,
the
Intimate
Letters
,
his
"
manifesto
on
love
"
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Sinfonietta
was
performed
in
London
,
Vienna
and
Dresden
.

In
his
later
years
,
the
still-active
Janáček
became
an
international
celebrity
.

He
became
a
member
of
the
Prussian
Academy
of
Arts
in
Berlin
in
0000
,
along
with
Arnold
Schoenberg
and
Paul
Hindemith
.

His
operas
and
other
works
were
finally
performed
at
the
world
stages
,
though
From
the
House
of
the
Dead
was
first
performed
posthumously
.

In
August
0000
he
took
an
excursion
to
Štramberk
with
Kamila
Stösslová
and
her
son
Otto
,
but
caught
a
chill
,
which
developed
into
pneumonia
.

He
died
on
00
August
0000
in
Ostrava
,
at
the
sanatorium
of
Dr.
L.
Klein
.

He
was
given
a
large
public
funeral
,
to
music
from
the
last
scene
of
his
Cunning
Little
Vixen
,
and
was
buried
in
the
Field
of
Honour
at
the
Central
Cemetery
,
Brno
.

Personality
Janáček
worked
tirelessly
throughout
his
life
.

He
led
the
organ
school
,
was
a
Professor
at
the
teachers
institute
and
gymnasium
in
Brno
,
collected
his
"
speech
tunes
"
and
was
composing
.

From
an
early
age
he
presented
himself
as
an
individualist
and
his
firmly
formulated
opinions
often
led
to
conflict
.

He
unhesitatingly
criticized
his
teachers
,
who
considered
him
a
defiant
and
anti-authoritarian
student
.

His
own
students
found
him
strict
and
uncompromising
.

Vilém
Tauský
,
one
of
his
pupils
,
described
his
encounters
with
Janáček
as
somewhat
distressing
for
someone
unused
to
his
personality
,
and
noted
that
Janáček
's
characteristically
staccato
speech
rhythms
were
reproduced
in
some
of
his
operatic
characters
.

In
0000
,
Janáček
gave
up
his
leading
role
with
the
Beseda
brněnská
,
as
a
response
to
criticism
,
but
a
rapid
decline
in
Beseda
's
performance
quality
led
to
his
recall
in
0000
.

His
married
life
,
settled
and
calm
in
its
early
years
,
became
increasingly
tense
and
difficult
following
the
death
of
his
daughter
,
Olga
,
in
0000
.

Years
of
effort
in
obscurity
took
their
toll
,
and
almost
ended
his
ambitions
as
a
composer
:
"
I
was
beaten
down
"
,
he
wrote
later
,
"
My
own
students
gave
me
advice
–
how
to
compose
,
how
to
speak
through
the
orchestra
"
.

Success
in
0000
–
when
Karel
Kovařovic
finally
decided
to
perform
Jenůfa
in
Prague
–
brought
its
own
problems
.

Janáček
grudgingly
resigned
himself
to
the
changes
forced
upon
his
work
.

Its
success
brought
him
into
Prague
's
music
scene
and
the
attentions
of
soprano
Gabriela
Horvátová
,
who
guided
him
through
Prague
society
.

Janáček
was
enchanted
by
her
.

On
his
return
to
Brno
,
he
appears
not
to
have
concealed
his
new
passion
from
Zdenka
,
who
responded
by
attempting
suicide
.

Janáček
was
furious
with
Zdenka
and
tried
to
instigate
a
divorce
,
but
lost
interest
in
Horvátová
.

Zdenka
,
anxious
to
avoid
the
public
scandal
of
formal
divorce
,
persuaded
him
to
settle
for
an
"
informal
"
divorce
.

From
then
on
,
until
Janáček
's
death
,
they
would
live
separate
lives
in
the
same
household
.

In
0000
he
began
his
lifelong
,
inspirational
and
unrequited
passion
for
Kamila
Stösslová
,
who
neither
sought
nor
rejected
his
devotion
.

Janáček
pleaded
for
first-name
terms
in
their
correspondence
.

In
0000
she
finally
agreed
and
signed
herself
"
Tvá
Kamila
"
(
Your
Kamila
)
in
a
letter
,
which
Zdenka
found
.

This
revelation
provoked
a
furious
quarrel
between
Zdenka
and
Janáček
,
though
their
living
arrangements
did
not
change
–
Janáček
seems
to
have
persuaded
her
to
stay
.

In
0000
,
the
year
of
his
death
,
Janáček
confessed
his
intention
to
publicise
his
feelings
for
Stösslová
.

Max
Brod
had
to
dissuade
him
.

Janáček
's
contemporaries
and
collaborators
described
him
as
mistrustful
and
reserved
,
but
capable
of
obsessive
passion
for
those
he
loved
.

His
overwhelming
passion
for
Stösslová
was
sincere
but
verged
upon
self-destruction
.

Their
letters
remain
an
important
source
for
Janáček
's
artistic
intentions
and
inspiration
.

His
letters
to
his
long-suffering
wife
are
,
by
contrast
,
mundanely
descriptive
.

Zdenka
seems
to
have
destroyed
all
hers
to
Janáček
.

Only
a
few
postcards
survive
.

Style
In
0000
Janáček
became
friends
with
Antonín
Dvořák
,
and
began
composing
in
a
relatively
traditional
romantic
style
.

After
his
opera
Šárka
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
his
style
absorbed
elements
of
Moravia
n
and
Slovak
folk
music
.

His
musical
assimilation
of
the
rhythm
,
pitch
contour
and
inflections
of
normal
Czech
speech
helped
create
the
very
distinctive
vocal
melodies
of
his
opera
Jenůfa
(
0000
)
,
whose
0000
success
in
Prague
was
to
be
the
turning
point
in
his
career
.

In
Jenůfa
,
Janáček
developed
and
applied
the
concept
of
"
speech
tunes
"
to
build
a
unique
musical
and
dramatic
style
quite
independent
of
"
Wagnerian
"
dramatic
method
.

He
studied
the
circumstances
in
which
"
speech
tunes
"
changed
,
the
psychology
and
temperament
of
speakers
and
the
coherence
within
speech
,
all
of
which
helped
render
the
dramatically
truthful
roles
of
his
mature
operas
,
and
became
one
of
the
most
significant
markers
of
his
style
.

Janáček
took
these
stylistic
principles
much
farther
in
his
vocal
writing
than
Modest
Mussorgsky
,
and
thus
anticipates
the
later
work
of
Béla
Bartók
.

The
stylistic
basis
for
his
later
works
originates
in
the
period
of
0000
–
0000
,
but
Janáček
composed
the
majority
of
his
output
–
and
his
best
known
works
–
in
the
last
decade
of
his
life
.

Much
of
Janáček
's
work
displays
great
originality
and
individuality
.

It
employs
a
vastly
expanded
view
of
tonality
,
uses
unorthodox
chord
spacings
and
structures
,
and
often
,
modality
:
"
there
is
no
music
without
key
.

Atonality
abolishes
definite
key
,
and
thus
tonal
modulation
....
Folksong
knows
of
no
atonality
.
"

Janáček
features
accompaniment
figures
and
patterns
,
with
(
according
to
Jim
Samson
)
"
the
on-going
movement
of
his
music
...
similarly
achieved
by
unorthodox
means
;
often
a
discourse
of
short
,
'
unfinished
'
phrases
comprising
constant
repetitions
of
short
motifs
which
gather
momentum
in
a
cumulative
manner
.
"

Janáček
named
these
motifs
"
sčasovka
"
in
his
theoretical
works
.
"

Sčasovka
"
has
no
strict
English
equivalent
,
but
John
Tyrrell
,
a
leading
specialist
on
Janáček
's
music
,
describes
it
as
"
a
little
flash
of
time
,
almost
a
kind
of
musical
capsule
,
which
Janáček
often
used
in
slow
music
as
tiny
swift
motifs
with
remarkably
characteristic
rhythms
that
are
supposed
to
pepper
the
musical
flow
.
"

Janáček
's
use
of
these
repeated
motifs
demonstrates
a
remote
similarity
to
minimalist
composers
(
Sir
Charles
Mackerras
called
Janáček
"
the
first
minimalist
composer
"
)
.

Legacy
Janáček
belongs
to
a
wave
of
00th
century
composers
who
sought
greater
realism
and
greater
connection
with
everyday
life
,
combined
with
a
more
all-encompassing
use
of
musical
resources
.

His
operas
in
particular
demonstrate
the
use
of
"
speech
"
-
derived
melodic
lines
,
folk
and
traditional
material
,
and
complex
modal
musical
argument
.

Janáček
's
works
are
still
regularly
performed
around
the
world
,
and
are
generally
considered
popular
with
audiences
.

He
would
also
inspire
later
composers
in
his
homeland
,
as
well
as
music
theorists
,
among
them
Jaroslav
Volek
,
to
place
modal
development
alongside
harmony
of
importance
in
music
.

The
operas
of
his
mature
period
,
Jenůfa
(
0000
)
,
Káťa
Kabanová
(
0000
)
,
The
Cunning
Little
Vixen
(
0000
)
,
The
Makropulos
Affair
(
0000
)
and
From
the
House
of
the
Dead
(
after
a
novel
by
Dostoyevsky
and
premiered
posthumously
in
0000
)
are
considered
his
finest
works
.

The
Australian
conductor
Sir
Charles
Mackerras
became
very
closely
associated
with
Janáček
's
operas
.

Janáček
's
chamber
music
,
while
not
especially
voluminous
,
includes
works
which
are
widely
considered
"
00th-century
classics
"
,
particularly
his
two
string
quartet
s
:
Quartet
No.
0
,
"
The
Kreutzer
Sonata
"
inspired
by
the
Tolstoy
novel
,
and
the
Quartet
No.
0
,
"
Intimate
Letters
"
.

Milan
Kundera
called
these
compositions
the
peak
of
Janáček
's
output
.

The
world
premiere
of
Janáček
's
lyrical
Concertino
for
piano
,
two
violins
,
viola
,
clarinet
,
French
horn
and
bassoon
took
place
in
Brno
on
00
February
0000
.

It
was
also
performed
at
the
Frankfurt
Festival
of
Modern
Music
in
0000
by
Ilona
Štěpánová-Kurzová
.

A
comparable
chamber
work
for
an
even
more
unusual
set
of
instruments
,
the
Capriccio
for
piano
left
hand
,
flute
,
two
trumpets
,
three
trombones
and
tenor
tuba
,
was
written
for
pianist
Otakar
Hollmann
,
who
lost
the
use
of
his
right
hand
during
World
War
I.
After
its
premiere
in
Prague
on
0
March
0000
,
the
Capriccio
gained
considerable
acclaim
in
the
musical
world
.

Other
well
known
pieces
by
Janáček
include
the
Sinfonietta
,
the
Glagolitic
Mass
(
the
text
written
in
Old
Church
Slavonic
)
,
and
the
rhapsody
Taras
Bulba
.

These
pieces
and
the
above
mentioned
five
late
operas
were
all
written
in
the
last
decade
of
Janáček
's
life
.

Janáček
established
a
school
of
composition
in
Brno
.

Among
his
notable
pupils
were
Jan
Kunc
,
Václav
Kaprál
,
Vilém
Petrželka
,
Jaroslav
Kvapil
,
Osvald
Chlubna
,
Břetislav
Bakala
,
and
Pavel
Haas
.

Most
of
his
students
neither
imitated
nor
developed
Janáček
's
style
,
which
left
him
no
direct
stylistic
descendants
.

According
to
Milan
Kundera
,
Janáček
developed
a
personal
,
modern
style
in
relative
isolation
from
contemporary
modernist
movements
but
was
in
close
contact
with
developments
in
modern
European
music
.

His
path
towards
the
innovative
"
modernism
"
of
his
later
years
was
long
and
solitary
,
and
he
achieved
true
individuation
as
a
composer
around
his
00th
year
.

Sir
Charles
Mackerras
,
the
Australian
conductor
who
helped
promote
Janáček
's
works
on
the
world
's
opera
stages
,
described
his
style
as
"
...
completely
new
and
original
,
different
from
anything
else
...
and
impossible
to
pin
down
to
any
one
style
"
.

According
to
Mackerras
,
Janáček
's
use
of
whole-tone
scale
differs
from
that
of
Debussy
,
his
folk
music
inspiration
is
absolutely
dissimilar
from
Dvořák
's
and
Smetana
's
,
and
his
characteristically
complex
rhythms
differ
from
the
techniques
of
the
young
Stravinsky
.

The
French
conductor
and
composer
Pierre
Boulez
,
who
interpreted
Janáček
's
operas
and
orchestral
works
,
called
his
music
surprisingly
modern
and
fresh
:
"
Its
repetitive
pulse
varies
through
changes
in
rhythm
,
tone
and
direction
.
"

He
described
his
opera
From
the
House
of
the
Dead
as
"
primitive
,
in
the
best
sense
,
but
also
extremely
strong
,
like
the
paintings
of
Léger
,
where
the
rudimentary
character
allows
a
very
vigorous
kind
of
expression
"
.

Janáček
's
life
has
featured
in
several
films
.

In
0000
Eva
Marie
Kaňková
made
a
short
documentary
Fotograf
a
muzika
(
The
Photographer
and
the
Music
)
about
the
Czech
photographer
Josef
Sudek
and
his
relationship
to
Janáček
's
work
.

In
0000
the
Brothers
Quay
produced
a
stop
motion
animated
film
,
Leoš
Janáček
:
Intimate
Excursions
,
about
Janáček
's
life
and
work
,
and
in
0000
the
Czech
director
Jaromil
Jireš
made
Lev
s
bílou
hřívou
(
Lion
with
the
White
Mane
)
,
which
showed
the
amorous
inspiration
behind
Janáček
's
works
.

In
Search
of
Janáček
is
a
Czech
documentary
directed
in
0000
by
Petr
Kaňka
,
made
to
celebrate
the
000th
anniversary
of
Janáček
's
birth
.

An
animated
cartoon
version
of
The
Cunning
Little
Vixen
was
made
in
0000
by
the
BBC
,
with
music
performed
by
the
Deutsches
Symphonie-Orchester
Berlin
and
conducted
by
Kent
Nagano
.

A
rearrangement
of
the
opening
of
the
Sinfonietta
was
used
by
the
progressive
rock
band
Emerson
,
Lake
&
Palmer
for
its
song
Knife-Edge
on
their
debut
album
.

The
Janáček
Philharmonic
Orchestra
was
established
in
0000
.

Today
the
000-piece
ensemble
is
associated
with
mostly
contemporary
music
but
also
regularly
performs
works
from
the
classical
repertoire
.

The
orchestra
is
resident
at
the
House
of
Culture
Vítkovice
(
Dům
kultury
Vítkovice
)
in
Ostrava
,
Czech
Republic
.

The
orchestra
tours
extensively
and
has
performed
in
Europe
,
the
U.S.
,
Australia
,
Japan
,
South
Korea
,
and
Taiwan
.

Its
current
music
director
is
Theodore
Kuchar
.

Criticism
Czech
musicology
at
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
was
strongly
influenced
by
Romanticism
,
in
particular
by
the
styles
of
Wagner
and
Smetana
.

Performance
practises
were
conservative
,
and
actively
resistant
to
stylistic
innovation
.

During
his
lifetime
,
Janáček
reluctantly
conceded
to
Karel
Kovařovic
's
instrumental
rearrangement
of
Jenůfa
,
most
noticeably
in
the
finale
,
in
which
Kovařovic
added
a
more
'
festive
'
sound
of
trumpets
and
French
horns
,
and
doubled
some
instruments
to
support
Janáček
's
"
poor
"
instrumentation
.

The
score
of
Jenůfa
was
later
restored
by
Charles
Mackerras
,
and
is
now
performed
according
to
Janáček
's
original
intentions
.

Another
important
Czech
musicologist
,
Zdeněk
Nejedlý
,
a
great
admirer
of
Smetana
and
later
a
communist
Minister
of
Culture
,
condemned
Janáček
as
an
author
who
could
accumulate
a
lot
of
material
,
but
was
unable
to
do
anything
with
it
.

He
called
Janáček
's
style
"
unanimated
"
,
and
his
operatic
duets
"
only
speech
melodies
"
,
without
polyphonic
strength
.

Nejedlý
considered
Janáček
rather
an
amateurish
composer
,
whose
music
did
not
conform
to
the
style
of
Smetana
.

According
to
Charles
Mackerras
,
he
tried
to
professionally
destroy
Janáček
.

Josef
Bartoš
,
the
Czech
aesthetician
and
music
critic
,
called
Janáček
a
"
musical
eccentric
"
who
clung
tenaciously
to
an
imperfect
,
improvising
style
,
but
Bartoš
appreciated
some
elements
of
Janáček
's
works
and
judged
him
more
positively
than
Nejedlý
.

Janáček
's
friend
and
collaborator
Václav
Talich
,
former
chief-conductor
of
the
Czech
Philharmonic
,
sometimes
adjusted
Janáček
's
scores
,
mainly
for
their
instrumentation
and
dynamics
;
some
critics
sharply
attacked
him
for
doing
so
.

Talich
re-orchestrated
Taras
Bulba
and
the
Suite
from
Cunning
Little
Vixen
justifying
the
latter
with
the
claim
that
"
it
was
not
possible
to
perform
it
in
the
Prague
National
Theatre
unless
it
was
entirely
re-orchestrated
"
.

Talich
's
rearrangement
rather
emasculated
the
specific
sounds
and
contrasts
of
Janáček
's
original
,
but
was
the
standard
version
for
many
years
.

Charles
Mackerras
started
to
research
Janáček
's
music
in
0000s
,
and
gradually
restored
the
composer
's
distinctive
scoring
.

The
critical
edition
of
Janáček
's
scores
is
published
by
the
Czech
Editio
Janáček
.

Inspiration
Janáček
's
style
draws
on
several
sources
.

Folklore
Janáček
was
deeply
influenced
by
folklore
,
and
by
Moravian
folk
music
in
particular
,
but
not
by
the
pervasive
,
idealized
00th
century
romantic
folklore
variant
.

He
took
a
realistic
,
descriptive
and
analytic
approach
to
the
material
.

Janáček
partly
composed
the
original
piano
accompaniments
to
more
than
000
folk
songs
,
respectful
of
their
original
function
and
context
,
and
partly
used
folk
inspiration
in
his
own
works
,
especially
in
his
mature
compositions
.

His
work
in
this
area
was
not
stylistically
imitative
;
instead
,
he
developed
a
new
and
original
musical
aesthetic
based
on
a
deep
study
of
the
fundamentals
of
folk
music
.

Through
his
systematic
notation
of
folk
songs
as
he
heard
them
,
Janáček
developed
an
exceptional
sensitivity
to
the
melodies
and
rhythms
of
speech
,
from
which
he
compiled
a
collection
of
distinctive
segments
he
called
"
speech
tunes
"
.

He
used
these
"
essences
"
of
spoken
language
in
his
vocal
and
instrumental
works
.

The
roots
of
his
style
,
marked
by
the
lilts
of
human
speech
,
emerge
from
the
world
of
folk
music
.

Russia
Janáček
's
deep
and
lifelong
affection
for
Russia
and
Russian
culture
represents
another
important
element
of
his
musical
inspiration
.

In
0000
he
attended
the
Prague
performance
of
Tchaikovsky
's
music
,
and
met
the
older
composer
.

Janáček
profoundly
admired
Tchaikovsky
,
and
particularly
appreciated
his
highly
developed
musical
thought
in
connection
with
the
use
of
Russian
folk
motifs
.

Janáček
's
Russian
inspiration
is
especially
apparent
in
his
later
chamber
,
symphonic
and
operatic
output
.

He
closely
followed
developments
in
Russian
music
from
his
early
years
,
and
in
0000
,
following
his
first
visit
of
Russia
,
he
founded
a
Russian
Circle
in
Brno
.

Janáček
read
Russian
authors
in
their
original
language
.

Their
literature
offered
him
an
enormous
and
reliable
source
of
inspiration
,
though
this
did
not
blind
him
to
the
problems
of
Russian
society
.

He
was
twenty-two
years
old
when
he
wrote
his
first
composition
based
on
a
Russian
theme
:
a
melodrama
,
Death
,
set
to
Lermontov
's
poem
.

In
his
later
works
,
he
often
used
literary
models
with
sharply
contoured
plots
.

In
0000
Zhukovsky
's
Tale
of
Tsar
Berendei
inspired
him
to
write
the
Fairy
Tale
for
Cello
and
Piano
.

He
composed
the
rhapsody
Taras
Bulba
(
0000
)
to
Gogol
's
short
story
,
and
five
years
later
,
in
0000
,
completed
his
first
string
quartet
,
inspired
by
Tolstoy
´
s
Kreutzer
Sonata
.

Two
of
his
later
operas
were
based
on
Russian
themes
:
Káťa
Kabanová
,
composed
in
0000
to
Alexander
Ostrovsky
's
play
,
The
Storm
:
and
his
last
work
,
From
the
House
of
the
Dead
,
which
transformed
Dostoyevsky
's
vision
of
the
world
into
an
exciting
collective
drama
.

Janáček
always
deeply
admired
Antonín
Dvořák
,
to
whom
he
dedicated
some
of
his
works
.

He
rearranged
part
of
Dvořák
's
Moravian
Duets
for
mixed
choir
with
original
piano
accompaniment
.

In
the
early
years
of
the
00th
century
,
Janáček
became
increasingly
interested
in
the
music
of
other
European
composers
.

His
opera
Destiny
was
a
response
to
another
significant
and
famous
work
in
contemporary
Bohemia
–
Louise
,
by
the
French
composer
Gustave
Charpentier
.

The
influence
of
Giacomo
Puccini
is
apparent
particularly
in
Janáček
's
later
works
,
for
example
in
his
opera
Káťa
Kabanová
.

Although
he
carefully
observed
developments
in
European
music
,
his
operas
remained
firmly
connected
with
Czech
and
Slavic
themes
.

Music
theorist
Musicology
Janáček
created
his
music
theory
works
,
essays
and
articles
over
a
period
of
fifty
years
,
from
0000
to
0000
.

He
wrote
and
edited
the
Hudební
listy
journal
,
and
contributed
to
many
specialist
music
journals
,
such
as
Cecílie
,
Hlídka
and
Dalibor
.

He
also
completed
several
extensive
studies
,
as
Úplná
nauka
o
harmonii
(
The
Complete
Harmony
Theory
)
,
O
skladbě
souzvukův
a
jejich
spojův
(
On
the
Construction
of
Chords
and
Their
Connections
)
and
Základy
hudebního
sčasování
(
Basics
of
Musical
Sčasování
)
.

In
his
essays
and
books
,
Janáček
examined
various
musical
topics
,
forms
,
melody
and
harmony
theories
,
dyad
and
triad
chords
,
counterpoint
(
or
"
opora
"
,
meaning
"
support
"
)
and
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
the
mental
composition
.

His
theoretical
works
stress
the
Czech
term
"
sčasování
"
,
Janáček
's
specific
word
for
rhythm
,
which
has
relation
to
time
(
"
čas
"
in
Czech
)
,
and
the
handling
of
time
in
music
composition
.

He
distinguished
several
types
of
rhythm
(
sčasovka
)
:
"
znící
"
(
sounding
)
–
meaning
any
rhythm
,
"
čítací
"
(
counting
)
–
meaning
smaller
units
measuring
the

Other
writings
Leoš
Janáček
's
literary
legacy
represents
an
important
illustration
of
his
life
,
public
work
and
art
between
0000
and
0000
.

He
contributed
not
only
to
music
journals
,
but
wrote
essays
,
reports
,
reviews
,
feuilletons
,
articles
and
books
.

His
work
in
this
area
comprises
around
000
individual
items
.

His
writing
changed
over
time
,
and
appeared
in
many
genres
.

Nevertheless
,
the
critical
and
theoretical
sphere
remained
his
main
area
of
interest
.

Folk
music
research
Janáček
came
from
a
region
characterized
by
its
deeply
rooted
folk
culture
,
which
he
explored
as
a
young
student
under
Pavel
Křížkovský
.

His
meeting
with
the
folklorist
and
dialectologist
František
Bartoš
(
0000
–
0000
)
was
decisive
in
his
own
development
as
a
folklorist
and
composer
,
and
led
to
their
collaborative
and
systematic
collections
of
folk
songs
.

Janáček
became
an
important
collector
in
his
own
right
,
especially
of
Lachian
,
Moravian
Slovakia
n
,
Moravian
Wallachia
n
and
Slovakia
n
songs
.

From
0000
,
his
collections
included
transcribed
speech
intonations
.

He
was
one
of
the
organizers
of
the
Czech-Slavic
Folklore
Exhibition
,
an
important
event
in
Czech
culture
at
the
end
of
00th
century
.

From
0000
he
was
President
of
the
newly
instituted
Working
Committee
for
Czech
National
Folksong
in
Moravia
and
Silesia
,
a
branch
of
the
Austrian
institute
Das
Volkslied
in
Österreich
(
Folksong
in
Austria
)
,
which
was
established
in
0000
by
the
Viennese
publishing
house
Universal
Edition
.

Janáček
was
a
pioneer
and
propagator
of
ethnographic
photography
in
Moravia
and
Silesia
.

In
October
0000
he
acquired
an
Edison
phonograph
and
became
one
of
the
first
to
use
phonographic
recording
as
a
folklore
research
tool
.

Several
of
these
recording
sessions
have
been
preserved
,
and
were
reissued
in

.

his
own
libretti
to
his
last
three
operas
.

His
libretti
were
translated
into
German
by
Max
Brod
.

Orchestral
The
early
orchestral
works
are
influenced
by
Romantic
style
,
and
especially
by
orchestral
works
of
Dvořák
.

In
his
later
works
,
created
after
0000
,
Janáček
found
his
own
,
original
expression
.

Vocal
and
choral
Janáček
's
choral
works
,
known
particularly

to
the
words
of

poet
Petr
Bezruč
.

Chamber

instrumental
His
string
quartets
are

short
period
of
twelve
years
,

in
Juniata
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was

at
the

History
Port
Royal
was
originally
named
Perrysville
,
after
Commodore
Oliver
Hazard
Perry
.

At
the
time
,
the
Port
Royal
post
office
was
located
in
Saint
Tammany
town
,
just
across
the
Tuscarora
Creek
.

However
,
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
brought
increased
traffic
through
the
area
and
prompted
a
move
of
the
Port
Royal
post
office
into
Perrysville
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
borough
took
on
the
name
itself
and
Saint
Tammany
became
known
as
Old
Port
.

Port
Royal
(
and
Perrysville
before
it
)
once
was
a
stop
on
the
old
main
line
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

Port
Royal
was
,
in
fact
,
one
of
the
first
towns
to
be
linked
to
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
system
,
as
it
lay
along
the
Lewistown-to-Harrisburg
stretch
of
the
railroad
—
the
first
leg
constructed
after
the
new
railroad
was
chartered
.

The
old
Pennsylvania
Railroad
station
no
longer
exists
.

Port

Lee
was
concentrating
the
Army

was
held
in

and
there
has
been
an
annual
fair
in

fairgrounds
south
of
town
was
found
to

Hay-on-Wye
(
)
,
often
described
as
"
the
town
of
books
"
,
is
a
small
market
town
and
community
in
Powys
,
Wales
.

Location
The
town
lies
on
the
east
bank
of
the
River
Wye
and
is
within
the
Brecon
Beacons
National
Park
,
just
north
of
the
Black
Mountains
.

The
town
is
situated
just
within
the
Welsh
side
of
the
border
with
Herefordshire
,
England
,
which
is
defined
by
the
Dulas
Brook
at
this
stretch
.

Where
the
brook
joins
the
River
Wye
just
to
the
north
of
the
town
,
the
border
continues
north
along
the
river
.

Hay
has
approximately
0,000
inhabitants
.

The
village
of
Cusop
lies
on
the
other
side
of
the
Dulas
Brook
and
is
in
England
.

The
nearest
city
is
Hereford
,
county
town
of
Herefordshire
,
some
00
miles
(
00
km
)
to
the
east
.

The
town
was
formerly
served
by
Hay-on-Wye
railway
station
by
the
train
services
known
as
the
Canney
Creeper
,
which
closed
in
0000
under
the
infamous
Beeching
Axe
.

Book
town
Hay-on-Wye
is
a
destination
for
bibliophiles
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
with
over
thirty
bookshops
,
many
selling
specialist
and
second-hand
books
.

Castle
Hay-on-Wye
,
like
Builth
Wells
,
has
two
Norman
castle
s
within
a
short
distance
of
each
other
.

It
seems
likely
that
Hay
was
fortified
by
William
Fitz
Osbern
during
his
penetration
of
south-east
Wales
in
the
summer
of
0000
when
he
defeated
three
Welsh
kings
.

The
history
of
the
site
then
continues
through
the
lordships
of
the
de
Neufmarchés
,
which
was
confirmed
at
the
Battle
of
Brecon
in
0000
,
and
also
the
Gloucester/Hereford
families
until
0000
,
when
the
district
of
Brycheiniog
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
de
Braose
dynasty
of
Marcher
Lord
s.
In
0000
Hay
Castle
passed
to
the
de
Bohuns
and
the
local
history
,
including
the
battle
near
Hay
in
0000
,
is
continued
through
the
Mortimer
Wars
of
the
0000s
and
the
battle
near
Brecon
in
0000
down
to
the
death
of
Earl
Humphrey
de
Bohun
in
0000
.

The
first
castle
Lying
close
to
St.
Mary
’s
Church
on
the
western
edge
of
Hay-on-Wye
is
a
small
but
well-preserved
motte
.

The
site
overlooks
a
gorge
and
small
stream
,
locally
known
as
The
Loggin
Brook
,
that
flows
into
the
River
Wye
,
which
was
undoubtedly
one
reason
for
the
construction
of
a
motte
and
bailey
castle
there
.

A
recently
levelled
platform
under
the
car
park
to
the
north
east
may
have
once
have
housed
the
castle
's
bailey
.

This
little
fortress
was
probably
the
work
of
William
Revel
,
a
knight
of
Bernard
de
Neufmarché
who
is
usually
referred
to
as
Bernard
Newmarch
,
and
may
later
have
been
the
seat
for
the
manor
or
commote
of
Melinog
.

Other
than
this
,
the
motte
has
no
further
recorded
history
.

The
stone
castle
The
main
fortress
within
Hay-on-Wye
was
situated
on
the
great
site
commanding
the
town
and
river
under
the
current
ruins
of
the
castle
and
mansion
.

This
was
undoubtedly
the
'
castello
de
haia
'
handed
to
Miles
de
Gloucester
,
0st
Earl
of
Hereford
in
0000
with
Sibyl
de
Neufmarché
,
the
daughter
of
Bernard
de
Neufmarché
.

It
is
most
likely
that
the
keep
stood
by
this
time
.

It
is
therefore
possible
that
this
is
the
oldest
Norman
tower
in
Wales
,
dating
to
the
onslaught
of
William
Fitz
Osbern
in
0000
.

During
the
anarchy
(
0000-00
)
in
the
reign
of
King
Stephen
a
series
of
charter
s
were
passed
by
the
Gloucesters
concerning
the
castle
.

In
0000
the
last
of
Miles
de
Gloucester
's
male
descendants
was
killed
at
nearby
Bronllys
Castle
and
Hay-on-Wye
Castle
passed
into
the
hands
of
William
de
Braose
,
0rd
Lord
of
Bramber
and
of
New
Radnor
and
Buellt
.

The
de
Braose
dynasty
were
energetic
lords
and
probably
built
the
core
of
the
gatehouse
which
now
stands
besides
the
keep
.

In
the
summer
of
0000
a
major
English
army
formed
here
before
marching
off
to
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Painscastle
some
four
miles
to
the
north
.

In
0000
the
last
de
Braose
of
Brecon
,
William
de
Braose
was
hanged
by
Prince
Llywelyn
ab
Iorwerth
and
Brecon
lordship
with
Hay-on-Wye
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
de
Bohuns
.

Taking
advantage
of
this
in
0000
,
Prince
Llywelyn
ravaged
the
lands
of
his
de
Bohun
in-laws
during
which
Hay-on-Wye
town
was
burnt
,
although
the
castle
survived
the
onslaught
.

The
castle
saw
service
in
the
Barons
'
War
of
0000
to
0000
,
changing
hands
three
times
,
once
being
surrendered
to
the
great
Simon
de
Montfort
,
0th
Earl
of
Leicester
.

With
the
conquest
of
Wales
by
King
Edward
I
Longshanks
life
became
more
peaceful
in
this
Marcher
town
.

Around
0000
both
town
and
castle
suffered
damage
by
the
forces
of
Owain
Glyndŵr
,
although
the
castle
was
listed
as
defensible
against
the
Welsh
in
0000
.

The
fortress
later
passed
to
the
earls
of
Stafford
,
who
were
to
become
the
unlucky
dukes
of
Buckingham
during
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
.

The
castle
was
repaired
during
the
conflicts
of
the
0000s
,
although
its
military
use
would
have
been
somewhat
dubious
against
cannon
.

In
the
0000s
,
James
Boyle
of
Hereford
built
a
new
mansion
on
the
north
side
of
the
castle
,
while
most
of
the
curtain
wall
was
demolished
to
improve
the
views
.

The
mansion
is
now
used
for
second-hand
bookselling
.

Remains
of
castle
The
keep
is
roughly
thirty
feet
square
and
was
once
of
four
storeys
.

The
corners
of
the
tower
have
been
much
rebuilt
,
probably
due
to
insecure
foundations
.

The
entire
south
east
corner
of
the
tower
has
been
replaced
and
it
is
possible
that
when
first
constructed
there
was
a
spiral
stair
here
to
allow
access
to
the
upper
floors
.

This
tower
is
similar
to
the
keep
found
at
Goodrich
Castle
.

Some
time
in
the
00th
century
the
powerful
curtain
wall
with
gate
was
added
to
the
site
.

This
gateway
is
one
of
the
finest
carved
castle
gateways
in
Wales
and
is
comparable
with
the
much
more
ornate
work
at
Newcastle
near
Bridgend
.

The
two
gates
hanging
within
the
gateway
,
although
of
different
ages
,
would
appear
to
be
very
old
—
the
gates
at
Chepstow
Castle
have
been
dendrochronological
ly
dated
to
the
reign
of
King
Henry
II
(
0000-00
)
.

Probably
during
the
troubles
of
the
Barons
'
War
a
small
tower
was
added
in
front
of
the
gateway
to
make
a
proper
gatehouse
complete
with
portcullis
.

The
portcullis
mechanism
mounted
on
the
wall
walk
was
reached
via
a
flight
of
steps
up
over
the
back
of
the
gate
passageway
which
also
allowed
access
to
the
wall
walks
.

Hay-on-Wye
is
twinned
with
Redu
,
a
village
in
the
Belgian
municipality
of
Libin
,
and
with
Timbuktu
,
Mali
,
West
Africa
.

Hay
Festival
Since
0000
,
Hay-on-Wye
has
been
the
venue
for
a
literary
festival
,
now
sponsored
by
The
Daily
Telegraph
newspaper
,
which
draws
a
claimed
00,000
visitors
over
ten
days
at
the
beginning
of
June
to
see
and
hear
big
literary
names
from
all
over
the
world
.

King
of
Hay-on-Wye
On
0
April
0000
,
bibliophile
Richard
Booth
conceived
a
publicity
stunt
in
which
he
declared
Hay-on-Wye
to
be
an
'
independent
kingdom
'
with
himself
as
its
monarch
.

The
tongue-in-cheek
micronation
of
Hay-on-Wye
has
subsequently
developed
a
healthy
tourism
industry
based
on
literary
interests
for
which
some
credit
Booth
.

In
0000
,
Booth
announced
plans
to
sell
his
bookshop
and
move
to
Germany
;
on
this
occasion
local
MP
Roger
Williams
was
quoted
as
saying
"
His
legacy
will
be
that
Hay
changed
from
a
small
market
town
into
a
mecca
for
second-hand
book
lovers
and
this
transformed
the
local
economy
"

Waverly
Township
is
a

History
Waverly
was
founded
in
the
late
00th
century
by
settlers
from
Connecticut
,
along
The
Warriors
'
Path
,
and
was
originally
called
Abington
Center
.

In
0000
,
it
was
established
as
a
borough
within
Pennsylvania
;
since
there
was
another
municipality
named
Abington
located
near
Philadelphia
,
the
town
was
renamed
Waverly
after
Sir
Walter
Scott
's
Waverley
(
novel
)
,
popular
at
that
time
.

The
town
,
located
within
Lackawanna
County
,
gave
up
its
charter
in
0000
,
because
of
the
high
cost
to
upgrade
its
main
street
to
a
state
highway
,
and
became
Abington
Township
.

On
November

to

The
earliest
settlers
built
cabins
in
Waverly
around
0000
.

The
Philadelphia
and
Great
Bend
Turnpike
(
now
Main
Street
)
was
chartered
in
0000
by
the
Pennsylvania
Legislature
along
The
Warriors
'
Path
.

Started
in
0000
,
this
turnpike
was
completed
in
0000
.

During
this
time
,
the
first
three
houses
which
were
not
cabins
were
built
.

In
0000
,
the
Wayside
Inn
was
built
,
and
the
first
doctor
,
Dr.
Andrew
Bedford
,
set
up
practice
,
and
built
a
house
which
stands
today
on
Main
Street
.

The
first
general
store
was
built
in
0000
,
followed
by
a
second
inn
and
tavern
in
0000
.

A
building
boom
ensued
during
the
years
0000
through
0000
,
during
which
time
Waverly
was
a
profitable
small
scale
industrial
center
.

0000
through
0000
was
the
heyday
of
Waverly
's
industrial
era
.

Farmers
and
dairymen
shipped
their
goods
to
New
York
City
;
iron
foundries
flourished
,
and
numerous
retail
establishments
,
including
greengrocers
,
bakers
,
a
drugstore
,
dime
store
,
hardware
store
,
lumberyard
,
and
harness
shops
,
thrived
.

In
0000
,
the
railroad
was
laid
five
miles
from
Waverly
,
and
the
prosperity
of
the
town
faded
.

During
the
mid-00th
century
,
Waverly
was
a
stop
on
the
Underground
Railroad
.

Escaped
slaves
and
freedmen
found
a
sympathetic
population
in
Waverly
,
and
some
settled
in
small
houses
built
by
a
local
farmer
and
sold
to
them
.

The
freedmen
also
built
the
AME
Church
,
which
is
in
use
today
as
a
private
residence
.

It
is
one
of
five
churches
in
existence
in
0000
,
0
of
which
still
stand
and
are
still
active
congregations
.

The
Waverly
Historic
District
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in

Fire
in
0000
In
the
spring
of
0000
,
a
fire
devastated
the
four
downtown
blocks
of
Waverly
;
only
00
businesses
remained
thereafter
.

Of
those
,
two
buildings
have
operating
businesses
in
them
today
:
The
Waverly
Deli
and
The
Waverly
General
Store
.

The
front
two
blocks
were
an
eyesore
,
although
summer
visitors
continued
to
come
from
Scranton
to
Waverly
.

The
Belin
Family
bought
the
front
two
blocks
and
began
design
and
construction
of
the
Waverly
Community
House
.

The
building
was
completed
in
0000
,
and
expanded
to
the
back
two
blocks
of
the
original
downtown
;
all
streets
through
those
blocks
had
been
removed
,
and
the
transformation
of
downtown
to
picturesque
center
was
complete
.

The
Community
House
(
commonly
referred
to
as
"
The
Comm
"
)
sits
at
the
center
of
Waverly
.

The
brick
Dutch
colonial
structure
currently
houses
the
Waverly
Post
Office
,
a
gymnasium
with
basketball
court
,
a
public
playground
,
a
preschool
program
and
numerous
recreational
and
educational
offerings
for
families
with
young
children
.

The
Comm
also
plays
host
to
an
annual
home
and
garden
show
,
antique
fair
,
and
concerts
on
the
lawn
.

Margaretta
E.
Belin
funded
construction
of
The
Comm
as
a
memorial
to
her
husband
,
Henry
Belin
Jr.
,
after
his
death
in
0000
.

On
June
0
,
0000
,
the
building
and
a
portion
of
the
land
were
deeded
to
Abington
Township
for
the
benefit
of
the
township
's
residents
.

Wealthy
summer
visitors
from
Scranton
migrated
to
Waverly
on
a
permanent
basis
,
and
the
town
's
reputation
as
a
white-collar
bedroom
community
was
cemented
.

Education
The

was
started
in
his
log
cabin
in
0000
by
Elder
Miller
,
the
first
settler
in
the
town
.

The
first
dedicated
school
was
built
in
0000
on
the
Philadelphia
and
Great
Bend
Turnpike
.

After

as
a
school
,
it
became
a
private
residence
for
many
years
;
the
Waverly
Historic
Society
is
currently
planning
for
its
renovation
and
use
as
their
headquarters
.

In
0000
,
a
group
of
investors
started
the
Madison
Academy
.

This
was
a
private
school
which
enjoyed
high
regard
and
taught
a
rigorous
curriculum
to
boys
and
girls
.

Students
came
from
all
over
Pennsylvania
to
attend
the
Madison
Academy
;
some

its
graduates
became
judge
s
and
attorneys
.

The
tuition
ranged
from
$
0.00
to
$
00.00
per
quarter
,

to
$
0.00
per
week
.

Following

building
was
used
as
a
public
school
through

.

The
Belin
family
donated
a

the
town
that
originally
served

.

The
site
of
that

Carbondale
is
a
city
in
Lackawanna
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Carbondale
is
located
approximately
00
miles
due
northeast
of
the
city
of
Scranton
in
Northeastern
Pennsylvania
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
land
area
that
became
Carbondale
was
developed
by
William
and
Maurice
Wurts
,
the
founders
of
the
Delaware
and
Hudson
Canal
Company
,
during
the
rise
of
the
anthracite
coal
mining
industry
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Carbondale
was
the
site
of
the
first
deep
vein
anthracite
coal
mine
in
the
United
States
.

It
was
also
a
major
terminal
of
the
Delaware
and
Hudson
Railroad
.

Like
many
other
cities
and
towns
in
the
region
,
Carbondale
has
struggled
with
the
demise
of
the
once-prominent
coal
mining
industry
that
had
once
made
the
region
a
haven
for
immigrants
seeking
work
so
many
decades
ago
.

Immigrants
from
Wales
,
England
,
Scotland
,
Ireland
,
and
from
throughout
continental
Europe
came
to
Carbondale
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
and
early-twentieth
centuries
to
work
in
the
anthracite
and
railroading
industries
,
and
,
most
importantly
,
to
build
new
lives
for
themselves
and
their
families
.

Schools
For
the
0000-0000
school
year
,
there
are
two
schools
located
within

City
of
Carbondale
.

The
demographic
and
economic
decline
beginning
in
the
0000s
with
the
end
of
the
coal
mining
industry
has
left
its
mark
on
education
.

At
one
time
,
the
City
of
Carbondale
had
one
public
high
school
,
ten
public
elementary
schools
,
one
private
Catholic
high
school
,
and
two
private
Catholic
elementary
schools
which
served
a
city
of
just
over
00,000
citizens
.

Over
the
decades
,
changes
to
education
,
the
dramatic
population
decline
down
to
0,000
in
the
0000
Census
,
and
the
disappearance
of
religious
orders
have
reduced
the
number
of
schools
to
the
two
mentioned
above
.

Sacred
Heart

formed
as
a
result
of
the
merger

Clarks
Summit
is
a

History
The

William
Clark
.

Clark
had
fought
in
the
Battle
of
Bunker
Hill
during
the
Revolutionary
War
,
and
as
payment
for
his
military
service
,
he
was
issued
of
Pennsylvania
land
by
Congress
.

Because
of
disputes
between
Pennsylvania
and
Connecticut
over
the
area
of
land
that
is
now
northern
Pennsylvania
,
the
land
deed
issued
to
Clark
was
deemed
invalid
by
the
Luzerne
County
land
grant
office
.

Clark
had
no
choice
but
to
pay
for
the
land
himself
.

In
March
0000
,
Clark
and
his
three
sons
moved
into
a
log
cabin
in
the
Abington
wilderness
,
located
on
what
is
currently
the
Clarks
Green
Cemetery
.

The
first
school
was
built
in
0000
and
was
destroyed
by
fire
two
years
later
.

The
village
of
Clarks

Dickson
City
is
a
borough
in
Lackawanna
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
north
of
Scranton
.

Coal
mining
had
been
an
important
industry
in
the
past
.

Some
of
the
population
totals
follow
:
in
0000
,
0,000

0,000
;
in
0000
,

;
and
in
0000
,
00,000
.

Coal
miners
are
much
scarcer
in
Pennsylvania
today
than
they
had
been
,
so
populations
have
fallen
in
many
places
such
as
Dickson
City
;
The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Dickson
City
was
once
known
as
Priceburg
.

It
was
the
newest
village
in
the
valley
and
one
of
the
most
progressive
.

German
immigrants
then
founded
the
village
of
Priceville
in
0000
,
in
honor
of
Eli
Price
.

This
section
of
the
town
developed
rapidly
after
0000
,
when
John
Jermyn
sank
the
shaft
which
is
now
known
as
the
Johnson
shaft
.

Here
the
population
had
grown
from
000
to
000
.

In
June
0000
,
Dickson
City
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
,
including
at
the
time
all
of
the
present
borough
of
Throop
.

Dickson
City
received
its
name
from
Thomas
Dickson
.

Once
dominated
by
coal
mines
,
this
borough
has
in
recent
times
become
the
center
of
a
thriving
retail
corridor
focused
along
Business
Route
0
and
around
the
Viewmont
Mall
.

Many
of
the
nation
's
big-box
store
s
and
chain
restaurants
are
represented
here
.

Most
of
the
newer
retail
complexes
are
located
along
Viewmont
Drive
and
Commerce
Boulevard
,
both
built
by
developers
to
access
the
borough
's
vast
dormant
coal
lands
.

Some
of
the
centers
that
were
built
in
the
0000s
and
early
0000s
include
Dickson
City
Crossings
,
Dickson
City
Commons
,
Park
Center
and
Commerce
Plaza
.

A
Target
center
,
Adventure
Games
(
the
largest
gaming
shop
in

Pennsylvania
)
,
a
Great

IMAX
Movie

and
stores
such

Dick
's
Sporting
Goods
and
the
only
Books
a
Million
book
store
in
the
area
are
located
at
these
shopping
centers
.

The
borough
also
boasts
northeastern
Pennsylvania
's
first
Starbucks
location
.

Recently
,
the
borough
unexpectedly
entered
the
pop
culture
scene
.

In
a
0000
episode
of
NBC
's
sitcom
,
The
Office
,
entitled
"
Take
Your
Daughter
to
Work
Day
"
,
Michael
(
Steve
Carell

asks
Ryan
(
B.J.
Novak
)
to
get
a
particular
video
from
his
mom
's
house
"
in
Dickson
City
.

The
show
uses
Scranton
as
its
setting
.

After
Route
0
(
also
named
the
Scranton/Carbondale
Highway
)
,
Main
Street
serves
as
the
borough
's
other
major
thoroughfare
.

It
features
a
slightly
older
stock
of
stores
,
bars
,
professional
offices
and
homes
.

One
recent
point
of
major
contention
in
the
borough
has
been
a
swath
of
reclaimed
coal-mining
land
south
of
Commerce
Boulevard
that
was
deeded
to
the
borough
for
public
use
after
the
state
government
cleaned
it
up
.

Plans
to
build
a
bond-financed
municipal
golf
course
on
the
land
launched
during
the
early
0000s
were

contains
several

:
Dunmore
High
School
,
Holy
Cross
High
School
formerly
known
as
Bishop
O'Hara
,
and
Saint
Mary
's
of
Mount
Carmel
Elementary
School
.

History
Dunmore
is
one
of
the
numerous
villages
which
sprang
from
the
original
township
of
Providence
,
Pennsylvania
.

Purchased
from
the
natives
in
0000
,
the
territory
now
embracing
this
village
offered
its
solitude
to
the
pioneers
seeking
a
home
in
the
wilderness
between
the
Delaware
and
the
Susquehanna
rivers
until
the
summer
of
0000
.

At
this
time
,
William
Allsworth
,
a
shoemaker
by
trade
,
who
had
visited
the
Connecticut
land
at
Wyoming
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
a
place
for
his
home
the
year
previous
,
reached
the
point
at
evening
,
where
he
encamped
and
lit
his
fire
in
the
forest
where
Dunmore
was
thus
founded
.

The
need
of
more
places
of
rest
to
cheer
the
emigrants
traveling
with
heavy
burdens
induced
Mr.
Allsworth
to
fix
his
abode
at
this
spot
.

Deer
and
bear
were
so
abundant
for
many
years
within
sight
of
his
clearing
,
that
his
family
never
trusted
to
his
rifle
in
vain
for
a
supply
of
venison
or
the
substantial
haunches
of
the
bear
.

The
house
of
Mr.
Allsworth
,
famed
for
the
constant
readiness
of
the
host
to
smooth
by
his
dry
jokes
and
kind
words
the
ruggedness
of
every
man
’s
daily
road
,
became
a
common
point
of
interest
and
attraction
to
the
emigrant
or
the
wayfarer
.

The
descendants
of
Mr.
Allsworth
have
filled
many
places
of
trust
and
usefulness
in
the
county
,
and
adorned
the
various
walks
of
social
life
.

In
the
summer
of
0000
,
Charles
Dolph
,
John
Carey
,
and
John
West
began
the
labor
of
clearing
and
plowing
lands
in
the
neighborhood
of
Bucktown
or
Corners
,
as
this
place
was
long
called
after
the
first
foot-path
opened
from
Blakeley
to
the
Roaring
Brook
crossed
the
Wyoming
road
at
Allsworth
’s
.

Edward
Lunnon
,
Isaac
Dolph
,
James
Brown
,
Philip
Swartz
and
Levi
De
Puy
,
purchased
land
of
the
State
between
0000
–
0000
and
located
in
this
portion
of
Providence
Township
.

The
old
tavern
,
long
since
vanished
with
its
round
swinging
sign
and
low
bar-room
,
one
corner
of
which
,
fortified
with
long
pine-pickets
,
extended
from
the
bar
to
the
very
ceiling
,
in
times
of
yore
,
was
owned
successively
by
Wm.
Allsworth
,
Philip
Swartz
,
Isaac
Dolph
,
Henry
W.
Drinker
,
and
Samuel
De
Puy
.

The
external
aspect
of
Dunmore
promised
so
much
by
its
agricultural
expectations
in
0000
,
that
Dr.
Orlo
Hamlin
,
with
his
young
wife
,
was
induced
to
settle
a
mile
north
of
Allsworth
.

He
was
the
first
physician
and
surgeon
locating
in
Providence
.

The
population
of
Dunmore
and
Blakeley
,
doubling
in
numbers
and
increasing
in
wealth
,
warranted
Stephen
Tripp
in
erecting
a
saw
and
grist
mill
in
0000
,
on
the
Roaring
Brook
half
a
mile
south
of
the
village
.

A
store
was
opened
at
the
Corners
in
0000
under
the
auspices
of
the
Drinker
Turnpike
;
but
the
village
,
consisting
of
but
four
houses
,
had
but
a
negative
existence
until
the
Pennsylvania
Coal
Company
,
in
0000-0000
,
turned
the
sterile
pasture-fields
around
it
into
a
town
liberal
in
the
extent
of
its
territory
and
diversified
by
every
variety
of
life
.

By
0000
,
the
township
of
Providence
was
dissolved
and
the
land
split
up
into
various
smaller
boroughs
and
towns
with
Dunmore
being
one
of
them
.

class
housing
community
of
Crystal
Lake
,
and
Richmondale
,
which
borders
the
nearby
borough
of
Vandling
to
the
north
.

Richmondale
is
currently
home
to
000
people
.

The
original
house
in
Simpson
was
the
Morss
Mansion
on
Lord
Avenue
,
built
in
0000
.

The
house
inspired
Hank
Williams
'
song
"
Mansion
on
the
Hill
"
.

By
0000
,
the
mansion
was
empty
,
and
title
of
it
and
the
surrounding
property
fell
in
the
hands
of
the
local
volunteer
fire
company
.

Due
to
lack
of
maintenance
,
the
mansion
was
in
disrepair
by
the
0000s
,
and
despite
public
outcry
,
the
mansion
was
tragically
torn
down
in
the
summer
of
0000
.

The
land
is
currently
vacant
except
for
a
small
fire
station
.

Recent
Years
In
recent
years
,
Fell
Township
has
declined
considerably
.

Many
of
the
houses
,
which
in
past
decades
were
single-family
dwellings
,
have
become
vacant
as
the
youth
move
elsewhere
and
the
older
citizens
move
to
assisted
living
situations
or
die
.

These
homes
have
been
either
left
vacant
or
purchased
by
landlords
from
out
of
the
area
and
subdivided
into
apartment
units
,
bringing
in
underemployed
and
disadvantaged
people
from
out
of
the
area
.

There
have
been
considerable
increases
in
petty
crime
.

In
0000
a
wave
of
arson
occurred
in
northern
Lackawanna
County
,
affecting
Fell
Township
and
the
nearby
borough
of
Vandling
the
hardest
.

Many
of
the
other
abandoned
homes
have
been
scoured
clean
,
and
in
0000
there
have
been
multiple
homes
from
which
the
old
copper
piping
and
wiring
have
been
stolen
.

Because
the
township
does
not
have
a
local
police
force
for
"
economic
reasons
,
"
according
to
township
supervisor
Ronald
Cosklo
,
as
must
therefore
solely
rely
on
the
Dunmore
State
Police
force
for
protection
,
Fell
Township
has
in
recent
years
become
a
veritable
hotbed
for
illegal
drugs
which
are
then
sold
to
the
neighboring
City
of
Carbondale
.

Petty
crimes
such
as
larceny
and
traffic
violations
have
become
the
norm
,
with
ATV
street
races
occurring
regularly
in
Simpson
.

In
the
past
decade
there
has
also
been
considerable
consolidation
of
the
area
's
Roman
Catholic
church
parishes
.

In
0000
,
Holy
Trinity
Church
,
originally
designated
as
an
ethnic
Slovakian
parish
,
was
closed
and
consolidated
with
St.
Michael
the
Archangel
Church
(
originally
designated
as
an
ethnic
Polish
parish
)
.

The
decommissioned
Holy
Trinity
building
remained
empty
and
was
the
site
vandalism
and
drug
trade
until
it
was
demolished
in
the
autumn
of
0000
.

In
0000
,
further
restructuring
occurred
,
and
St.
Michael
the
Archangel
Parish
was
consolidated
with
St.
Rose
of
Lima
Parish
in
Carbondale
.

St.
Michael
the
Archangel
Church
only
has
occasional
masses
as
of
0000
,
and
no
longer
has
resident
clergy
.

History
Settled

the
town
of

was
named
after
Judge
William
Jessup
.

It
was
presented
to
the
Luzerne
County
Court
for
incorporation
as
the
Borough
of
Winton
in
December
0000
.

Two
years
later
,
Lackawanna
County
was
incorporated
.

The
early
0000s
were
very
significant
for
the
little
town
,
as
numerous
new
mining
operations
were
opened
.

Shortly
after
these
were
opened
,
immigrants
from
Europe
were
lured
to
the
area
by
the
work
available
in
the
booming
anthracite
coal
fields
.

It
was
mostly
Italian
immigrants
that
came
to
Jessup
in
search
of
jobs
in
the
coal
mines
,
among
others
.

They
arrived
via
Ellis
Island
,
New
York
in
the
late
00th
century
.

The
Italians
who
settled
in
Jessup
,
and
the
immediate
surrounding
communities
,
came
mostly
from
small
towns
in
the
Region
of
Umbria
,
Province
of
Perugia
.

Gubbio
,
Gualdo
Tadino
,
Scheggia
,
and
Sassoferrato
,
for
example
,
sent
many
hard
working
individuals
to
the
Lackawanna
Valley
for
economic
opportunity
.

It
was
from
Gubbio
,
Italy
that
the
immigrants
brought
the
annual
festival
known
as
Saint
Ubaldo
Day
.

This
festival
is
still
held
to
this
day
in
only
Jessup
and
Gubbio
.

Gubbio
,
incidentally
,
is
"
Sister
City
"
to
Jessup
resulting
from
a
process
that
began
in
May
,
0000
and
was
completed
formally
in
May
,
0000
.

As
customary
in
Italy
,
Gubbio
refers
to
Jessup
as
its
"
Citta
Gemellata
"
or
"
Twinned
City
"
.

will
be
celebrated
