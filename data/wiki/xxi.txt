Millersburg
is
a
city
in
Linn
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

Millersburg
originally
was
the
name
of
a
station
on
the
Southern
Pacific
railroad
line
,
which
was
named
for
a
local
farming
family
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Millersburg
came
into
being
in
0000
,
to
prevent
the
city
of
Albany
from
attempting
to
extend
its
city
limits
to
include
where
Wah
Chang
Corporation
operated
a
zirconium
processing
plant
for
the
United
States
Bureau
of
Mines
.

Although
now
owned
by
Teledyne
,
this
processing
plant
is
the
city
's
largest
employer
.

Millersburg
's
infamous
stench
of
past
years
,
often
attributed
to
the
Wah
Chang
facility
,
is
actually
generated
by
the
nearby
Weyerhaeuser
wood
products
processing
mill
.

This
has
lent
support
to
various
attempts
to
close
both
plants
.

In
August
0000
,
Weyerhauser
sold
the
mill
to
International

"

History
Settlers
first
arrived
in
the
Sweet
Home
Valley
in
the
early
0000s
.

A
community
known
as
Buckhead
developed
near
the
mouth
of
Ames
Creek
and
the
South
Santiam
River
.

Buckhead
was
named
after
a
saloon
that
featured
a
set
of
elk
antlers
on
the
gable
end
of
its
building
.

East
of
Buckhead
,
a
community
called
Mossville
developed
with
a
store
and
post
office
.

In
0000
,
the
two
communities
merged
to
become
one
community
called
Sweet
Home
.

In
0000
,
the
city
of
Sweet
Home
was
incorporated
.

The
Santiam
Wagon
Road
,
a
toll
road
connecting
the
Willamette
Valley
with
central
Oregon
,
was
opened
in
0000
.

The
road
extended
from
the
Sweet
Home
Valley
across
the
Santiam
Pass
in
the
Cascades
to
Camp
Polk
near
Sisters
.

The
Santiam
Wagon
Road
was
a
vital
means
of
supplying
livestock
and
goods
from
western
Oregon
to
central
Oregon
and
transporting
wool
from
east
of
the
Cascades
back
to
Willamette
Valley
woolen
mills
.

Competition
with
railroads
that
extended
south
from
the
Columbia
River
into
central
Oregon
and
the
newly
opened
McKenzie
Pass
Highway
made
the
wagon
road
obsolete
by
the
late
0000s
.

U.S.
Route
00
was
constructed
across
much
of
the
same
route
as
the
Santiam
Wagon
Road
.

Sweet
Home
experienced
significant
growth
during
the
0000s
due
to
the
demand
for
timber
from
local
forests
.

Further
growth
occurred
when
construction
began
on
nearby
Green
Peter
Dam
in
0000
and
continued
as
construction
began
on
Foster
Dam
in
0000
.

During
the
0000s
,
Sweet
Home
experienced
a
number
of
sawmill
and
plywood
mill
closures
due
to
logging
restrictions
placed
on
nearby
forests
resulting
from
environmental
concerns
for
endangered
species
.

In
response
,
community
members
sought
out
other
economic
development
opportunities
such
as
the
Oregon
Jamboree
country
music
and
camping
festival
.

History
In
0000
,
Oregon
Short
Line
Railroad
built
a
branch
into
this
part
of
Malheur
County
.

There
was
a
post
office
called
Riverview
on
the
east
side
of
the
Snake
River
and
because
the
railroad
did
not
want
a
station
of
the
same
name
on
the
west
side
,
the
name
Adrian
was
suggested
by
Reuben
McCreary
,
who
platted
the
townsite
.

The
name
was
chosen
to
honor
his
birthplace
,
Adrian
,
Illinois
.

Riverview
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
but
moved
across
the
river
in

the
name
changed
to
Adrian
in
0000
.

named
for
James
Adrian
,
a
sheep
rancher
,

he
did
not
arrive

.

Adrian
is
located
on

R.
H.
Tallman
,
the
Idaho
district
manager
of
the
Amalgamated
Sugar
Company
.

Successful
yields
led
to
the
first
Amalgamated-designed
and
built
factory
,
which
began
operation
on
October
0
,
0000
.

The
factory
was
located
at
,
on
both
the
Union
Pacific
Railroad
lines
and
along
U.S.
Route
00
.

Near
the
end
of
World
War
II
,
a
branch
camp
for
German
and
Italian
prisoners
of
war
from
Camp
Rupert
,
near
Buhl
,
Idaho
,
was
established
.

Those
POWs
helped
with
the
sugar
beet
industry
,
typically
through
thinning
and
harvesting
.

The
reason
for
closure
is
due
to
the
fact
that
Idaho
owners
did
not
like
the
union
and
in
Oregon
they
were
forced
to
join
.

The
Nyssa
plant
just
a
few
year
previously
produced
more
sugar
than
anywhere
for
Amalgamated
Sugar
.

To
date
the
plant
has
been
stripped
of
everything
except
the
brown
sugar
line
.

The
closure
of
this
factory
devastated
Nyssa
and
its
people
.

The
mechanic
shop
is
still
running
.

Beets
are
shipped
to
Nampa
,
Idaho
.

Nyssa
also
had
a
greenhouse
and
testing
facilities
which
were
later
moved
to
Twin
Falls
,
Id
.

the
Ontario
,
OR-ID
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
,
which
includes
Malheur
County
in

County
in

Ontario
is
approximately
halfway
between

Lake
City
.

It
is
the
closest
city
to

.

The
city
's
slogan
is
"
Where
Oregon
Begins
"
.

History
Ontario
was
founded
on
June
00
,
0000
,
by
developers
William
Morfitt
,
Mary
Richardson
,
Daniel
Smith
,
and
James
Virtue
.

In
March
of
0000
,
Richard
Welch
started
a
Post
Office
for
the
quartet
of
Ontario
,
so
named
by
James
Virtue
after
Ontario
,
Canada
.

Two
months
later
Joseph
Morton
applied
for
a
Morton
Post
Office
at
an
island
about
one
mile
south
of
town
,
with
Oscar
Scott
as
Post
Master
.

Unfortunately
for
Morton
and
Scott
,
merchants
Morfitt
and
Richardson
of
Malheur
City
,
gold
miner
Virtue
,
and
lumberman
Smith
of
Baker
acquired
more
land
and
were
better
financed
.

More
importantly
,
Morfitt
had
negotiated
a
train
depot
for
Ontario
.

All
the
settlers
and
speculators
knew
the
railroad
was
coming
and
how
important
that
would
be
to
Ontario
's
future
-
so
Scott
closed
his
Morton
Post
Office
and
built
a
hotel
at
present
day
Ontario
.

By
December
,
Scott
was
Ontario
's
Postmaster
.

The
town
continued
to
gow
with
the
arrival
of
the
Oregon
Short
Line
Railroad
in
later
0000
,
and
freight
and
passenger
service
were
added
to
the
town
's
offerings
.

Soon
after
,
stock
began
arriving
from
Eastern
Oregon
's
cattle
ranches
to
Ontario
's
stockyard
for
transshipment
to
markets
throughout
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

Ontario
became
one
of
the
largest
stockyards
in
the
West
.

In
addition
,
the
construction
of
the
Nevada
Ditch
and
other
canals
aided
the
burgeoning
agricultural
industry
,
adding
those
products
to
Ontario
's
exports
.

Ontario
was
incorporated
by
the
Oregon
Legislative
Assembly
on
February
00
,
0000

Big-box

sector
,
however
,
the
lack
of
a

tax
in

attracts
relocating

from

Ontario

is
challenged
by

While
Oregon
's
lack

an
asset

the

make
it
hard

Detroit
is
a
city
in
Marion
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
was
named
for
Detroit
,
Michigan
in
the
0000s
because
of
the
large
number
of
people
from
Michigan
in
the
community
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Salem
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
The
original
townsite
of
Detroit
was
inundated
in
the
summer
of
0000
when
the
Corps
of
Engineers
finished
Detroit
Dam
on
the
Santiam
River
.

The
community
was
relocated
about
a
half
mile
northwest
of
the
original
site
,
on
State
Highway
00
,
and
was
incorporated
as
a
city
the
same
year
.

Located
near
Detroit
Lake
and
Detroit
Lake
State
Park
,
Detroit
's
economy
is
dependent
on
tourism
.

The
community
suffered
from
a
drought
in
0000
,
when
Detroit
Lake
was
little
more
than
the
Santiam
River
through
the
summer
.

In
0000
,
by
a
vote
of
00-00
citizens
in
Detroit
voted
down
a
ballot
measure
that
would
have
changed
the
city
's
name
to
Detroit
Lake
,
the
name
of
the
neighboring
reservoir
and
one
of
the
most
visited
summer
sites
in
Oregon
.

The
proposal
was
put
forth
by
Doug
DeGeorge
,
a
builder
and
motel
owner
who
resides
in
Arizona
and
wanted
to
disassociate
the
town
from
Detroit
,
Michigan
and
its
close
ties
to
"
crime
,
corruption
,
failing
schools
and
a
shaky
auto
industry
"
.

Doug
DeGeorge
was
not
present
on
the
day
of
the
city
counsel
vote
,
but
repercussions
from
his
comments
had
phone
lines
flooded
with
angry
calls
from
Michigan
residents
.

Voters
chose
to
keep
the
original
name
of
the
city
,
however
,
most
residents
and
tourists
still
call
it
Detroit
Lake
.

Gary
Brown
,
a
city
councilman
in
Detroit
,
Michigan
,
disagreed
with
the
proposal
,
saying
local
residents
would
have
made
a
big
mistake
because
the
Motor
City
will
one
day
return
to
its
previous
glory
.

The
actual
motivation
behind
the
new
name
was
to
promote
tourism
,
much
like
Lake
Shasta
or
Lake
Tahoe
.

Keizer
(
)
is
a
city
in
Marion
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
,
along
the
00th
parallel
.

It
was
named
for
Thomas
Dove
and
John
Brooks
Keizur
,
two
pioneers
who
arrived
in
the
Wagon
Train
of
0000
,
and
later
filed
donation
land
claims
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Salem
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
The
original
settlement
was
at
Keizer
Bottom
,
near
the
banks
of
the
Willamette
River
.

The
community
was
named
after
Thomas
Dove
Keizur
,
one
of
its
first
settlers
.

Somewhere
in
the
translation
of
donation
land
claim
records
,
his
name
was
misspelled
.

The
settlement
suffered
in
the
flood
of
0000
,
and
the
inhabitants
rebuilt
their
homes
on
higher
ground
.

Further
floods
in
0000
,
0000
,
0000
and
0000
hampered
the
growth
of
the
community
,
and
it
was
not
until
dams
were
built
in
the
0000s
to
regulate
the
flow
of
the
Willamette
that
Keizer
began
to
flourish
.

Many
times
the
City
of
Salem
tried
to
annex
the
growing
community
adjacent
to
its
city
limits
.

Beginning
in
0000
,
a
number
of
Keizer
residents
tried
to
convince
the
people
of
Keizer
that
it
would
be
cheaper
and
better
to
form
their
own
city
.

It
was
not
until
November
0
,
0000
,
when
,
with
the
support
of
the
nearby
unincorporated
community
of
Clear
Lake
,
residents
voted
to
make
Keizer
a
city
.

Keizer
Bottom
is
now
the
site
of
Keizer
Rapids
Park
,
a
public
park

attractions
include
a
dog
park

shortly
afterwards
ministered
to
several
local
Roman
Catholic
parishes
,
about
the

Kalapuya
n

the
Archbishop
of

City
,
the
abbey
opened
Mount
Angel
Seminary
in
0000
for
the
training
of
priests
.

The
original
wooden
buildings
at
the
foot
of
the

fire
in

consumed
the
second
monastery
,
an
imposing
five-story
edifice
of

basalt
at
the
top
of
the
butte
.

History
Originally
,
the
area
around
Woodburn
was
inhabited
by
Native
Americans
of
the
Kalapuya
tribes
.

After
the
Provisional
Government
of
Oregon
set-up
land
claims
in
the
Oregon
Country
,
the
United
States
annexed
much
of
the
Pacific
Northwest
and
established
the
Oregon
Territory
in
0000
.

Congress
then
passed
the
Donation
Land
Claim
Act
in
0000
,
and
many
earlier
land
claims
became
donation
land
claims
.

Eli
Cooley
,
Bradford
S.
Bonney
,
George
Leisure
,
and
Jean
B.
Ducharme
all
established
donation
land
claims
on
the
eastern
part
of
the
French
Prairie
where
Woodburn
would
later
be
founded
.

Cooley
immigrated
to
Oregon
in
0000
,
and
Bonney
established
his
land
claim
in
0000
.

Ducharme
's
land
was
sold
off
in
0000
in
a
foreclosure
sale
,
with
Mt.
Angel
farmer
George
Settlemier
purchase
the
on
the
cheap
.

Settlemier
had
traveled
west
over
the
Oregon
Trail
in
0000
and
first
settled
in
California
before
moving
north
to
Oregon
in
0000
.

He
settled
in
the
Mt.
Angel
area
where
he
was
a
successful
nurseryman
.

Settlemier
then
moved
to
his
new
property
in
0000
and
established
the
Woodburn
Nursery
Company
.

Despite
improvements
to
the
land
,
including
construction
of
his
home
,
title
in
the
land
remained
in
doubt
due
to
the
purchase
via
a
foreclosure
sale
.

During
the
litigation
over
title
in
the
land
,
Settlemier
borrowed
money
from
capitalist
William
Reed
with
the
land
as
collateral
.

When
Reed
began
to
build
a
railroad
through
the
area
,
he
decided
to
run
the
line
through
what
became
Woodburn
in
anticipation
of
acquiring
the
land
himself
as
he
expected
Settlemier
to
default
on
the
mortgage
.

However
,
Settlemier
did
not
default
and
eventually
his
case
made
it
to
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
in
Settlemier
v.
Sullivan
,
00
U.S.
000
(
0000
)
,
and
he
retained
the
land
.

Meanwhile
,
transportation
baron
Ben
Holladay
also
ran
his
Oregon
and
California
Railroad
through
what
became
Woodburn
in
0000
,
at
which
time
Settlemier
platted
the
first
four
blocks
of
the
town
.

Originally
,
the
town
and
station
were
called
Halsey
,
but
the
name
was
changed
to
Woodburn
due
to
the
existence
of
Halsey
,
Oregon
,
further
down
the
valley
.

The
name
Woodburn
came
about
after
a
slash
burn
that
got
out
of
control
and
burned
down
a
nearby
woodlot
in
the
0000s
,
after
the
railroad
line
had
been
laid
through
the
area
.

A
railroad
official
witnessed
the
fire
and
renamed
the
community
.

The
city
was
incorporated
by
the
Oregon
Legislative
Assembly
on
February
00
,

property
also
includes
two
Portland

)
gas-fired
power
plants
.

PGE
also

According
to
a
November
0000
article
in
The
Oregonian
,
a
"
huge
data
center
linked
to

is
under
construction
"
at
the
Port

Morrow
along
the
Columbia
River
near

.

The
data
center
will
have
a
dedicated
ten

megawatt
electrical
substation
.

A
website
focused
on
data
centers
suggests
the
Boardman
site
is
in
response
to
the
rapid
growth
in
use
of
Amazon
Web
Services
since
in
October
Amazon
announced
that
Amazon
S0
was
storing

If
Amazon
's
involvement
is
confirmed
,
Boardman
becomes
the
second
Oregon
city
along
the
Columbia
River
to
host
a
power-hungry
data

for

Leadership
has
been
described
as
“
a
process
of
social
influence
in
which
one
person
can
enlist
the
aid
and
support
of
others
in
the
accomplishment
of
a
common
task
"
.

Other
in-depth
definitions
of
leadership
have
also
emerged
.

Leadership
is
"
organizing
a
group
of
people
to
achieve
a
common
goal
"
.

The
leader
may
or
may
not
have
any
formal
authority
.

Studies
of
leadership
have
produced
theories
involving
traits
,
situational
interaction
,
function
,
behavior
,
power
,
vision
and
values
,
charisma
,
and
intelligence
,
among

Somebody

Theories
Early
western
history
The
search
for
the
characteristics
or
traits
of
leaders
has
been
ongoing
for
centuries
.

History
's
greatest
philosophical
writings
from
Plato
's
Republic
to
Plutarch
's
Lives
have
explored
the
question
"
What
qualities
distinguish
an
individual
as
a
leader
?
"

Underlying
this
search
was
the
early
recognition
of
the
importance
of
leadership
and
the
assumption
that
leadership
is
rooted
in
the
characteristics
that
certain
individuals
possess
.

This
idea
that
leadership
is
based
on
individual
attributes
is
known
as
the
"
trait
theory
of
leadership
"
.

The
trait
theory
was
explored
at
length
in
a
number
of
works
in
the
00th
century
.

Most
notable
are
the
writings
of
Thomas
Carlyle
and
Francis
Galton
,
whose
works
have
prompted
decades
of
research
.

In
Heroes
and
Hero
Worship
(
0000
)
,
Carlyle
identified
the
talents
,
skills
,
and
physical
characteristics
of
men
who
rose
to
power
.

In
Galton
's
Hereditary
Genius
(
0000
)
,
he
examined
leadership
qualities
in
the
families
of
powerful
men
.

After
showing
that
the
numbers
of
eminent
relatives
dropped
off
when
moving
from
first
degree
to
second
degree
relatives
,
Galton
concluded
that
leadership
was
inherited
.

In
other
words
,
leaders
were
born
,
not
developed
.

Both
of
these
notable
works
lent
great
initial
support
for
the
notion
that
leadership
is
rooted
in
characteristics
of
the
leader
.

Rise
of
alternative
theories
In
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
,
however
,
a
series
of
qualitative
reviews
of
these
studies
(
e.g.
,
Bird
,
0000
;
Stogdill
,
0000
;
Mann
,
0000
)
prompted
researchers
to
take
a
drastically
different
view
of
the
driving
forces
behind
leadership
.

In
reviewing
the
extant
literature
,
Stogdill
and
Mann
found
that
while
some
traits
were
common
across
a
number
of
studies
,
the
overall
evidence
suggested
that
persons
who
are
leaders
in
one
situation
may
not
necessarily
be
leaders
in
other
situations
.

Subsequently
,
leadership
was
no
longer
characterized
as
an
enduring
individual
trait
,
as
situational
approaches
(
see
alternative
leadership
theories
below
)
posited
that
individuals
can
be
effective
in
certain
situations
,
but
not
others
.

This
approach
dominated
much
of
the
leadership
theory
and
research
for
the
next
few
decades
.

Reemergence
of
trait
theory
New
methods
and
measurements
were
developed
after
these
influential
reviews
that
would
ultimately
reestablish
the
trait
theory
as
a
viable
approach
to
the
study
of
leadership
.

For
example
,
improvements
in
researchers
'
use
of
the
round
robin
research
design
methodology
allowed
researchers
to
see
that
individuals
can
and
do
emerge
as
leaders
across
a
variety
of
situations
and
tasks
.

Additionally
,
during
the
0000s
statistical
advances
allowed
researchers
to
conduct
meta-analyses
,
in
which
they
could
quantitatively
analyze
and
summarize
the
findings
from
a
wide
array
of
studies
.

This
advent
allowed
trait
theorists
to
create
a
comprehensive
picture
of
previous
leadership
research
rather
than
rely
on
the
qualitative
reviews
of
the
past
.

Equipped
with
new
methods
,
leadership
researchers
revealed
the
following
:
While
the
trait
theory
of
leadership
has
certainly
regained
popularity
,
its
reemergence
has
not
been
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
increase
in
sophisticated
conceptual
frameworks
.

Specifically
,
Zaccaro
(
0000
)
noted
that
trait
theories
still
:
Attribute
pattern
approach
Considering
the
criticisms
of
the
trait
theory
outlined
above
,
several
researchers
have
begun
to
adopt
a
different
perspective
of
leader
individual
differences
—
the
leader
attribute
pattern
approach
.

In
contrast
to
the
traditional
approach
,
the
leader
attribute
pattern
approach
is
based
on
theorists
'
arguments
that
the
influence
of
individual
characteristics
on
outcomes
is
best
understood
by
considering
the
person
as
an
integrated
totality
rather
than
a
summation
of
individual
variables
.

In
other
words
,
the
leader
attribute
pattern
approach
argues
that
integrated
constellations
or
combinations
of
individual
differences
may
explain
substantial
variance
in
both
leader
emergence
and
leader
effectiveness
beyond
that
explained
by
single
attributes
,
or
by
additive
combinations
of
multiple
attributes
.

Behavioral
and
style
theories
In
response
to
the
early
criticisms
of
the
trait
approach
,
theorists
began
to
research
leadership
as
a
set
of
behaviors
,
evaluating
the
behavior
of
successful
leaders
,
determining
a
behavior
taxonomy
,
and
identifying
broad
leadership
styles
.

David
McClelland
,
for
example
,
posited
that
leadership
takes
a
strong
personality
with
a
well-developed
positive
ego
.

To
lead
,
self-confidence
and
high
self-esteem
are
useful
,
perhaps
even
essential
.

Kurt
Lewin
,
Ronald
Lipitt
,
and
Ralph
White
developed
in
0000
the
seminal
work
on
the
influence
of
leadership
styles
and
performance
.

The
researchers
evaluated
the
performance
of
groups
of
eleven-year-old
boys
under
different
types
of
work
climate
.

In
each
,
the
leader
exercised
his
influence
regarding
the
type
of
group
decision
making
,
praise
and
criticism
(
feedback
)
,
and
the
management
of
the
group
tasks
(
project
management
)
according
to
three
styles
:
authoritarian
,
democratic
,
and
laissez-faire
.

The
managerial
grid
model
is
also
based
on
a
behavioral
theory
.

The
model
was
developed
by
Robert
Blake
and
Jane
Mouton
in
0000
and
suggests
five
different
leadership
styles
,
based
on
the
leaders
'
concern
for
people
and
their
concern
for
goal
achievement
.

Positive
reinforcement
B.F.
Skinner
is
the
father
of
behavior
modification
and
developed
the
concept
of
positive
reinforcement
.

Positive
reinforcement
occurs
when
a
positive
stimulus
is
presented
in
response
to
a
behavior
,
increasing
the
likelihood
of
that
behavior
in
the
future
.

The
following
is
an
example
of
how
positive
reinforcement
can
be
used
in
a
business
setting
.

Assume
praise
is
a
positive
reinforcer
for
a
particular
employee
.

This
employee
does
not
show
up
to
work
on
time
every
day
.

The
manager
of
this
employee
decides
to
praise
the
employee
for
showing
up
on
time
every
day
the
employee
actually
shows
up
to
work
on
time
.

As
a
result
,
the
employee
comes
to
work
on
time
more
often
because
the
employee
likes
to
be
praised
.

In
this
example
,
praise
(
the
stimulus
)
is
a
positive
reinforcer
for
this
employee
because
the
employee
arrives
at
work
on
time
(
the
behavior
)
more
frequently
after
being
praised
for
showing
up
to
work
on
time
.

The
use
of
positive
reinforcement
is
a
successful
and
growing
technique
used
by
leaders
to
motivate
and
attain
desired
behaviors
from
subordinates
.

Organizations
such
as
Frito-Lay
,
0M
,
Goodrich
,
Michigan
Bell
,
and
Emery
Air
Freight
have
all
used
reinforcement
to
increase
productivity
.

Empirical
research
covering
the
last
00
years
suggests
that
reinforcement
theory
has
a
00
percent
increase
in
performance
.

Additionally
,
many
reinforcement
techniques
such
as
the
use
of
praise
are
inexpensive
,
providing
higher
performance
for
lower
costs
.

Situational
and
contingency
theories
Situational
theory
also
appeared
as
a
reaction
to
the
trait
theory
of
leadership
.

Social
scientists
argued
that
history
was
more
than
the
result
of
intervention
of
great
men
as
Carlyle
suggested
.

Herbert
Spencer
(
0000
)
(
and
Karl
Marx
)
said
that
the
times
produce
the
person
and
not
the
other
way
around
.

This
theory
assumes
that
different
situations
call
for
different
characteristics
;
according
to
this
group
of
theories
,
no
single
optimal
psychographic
profile
of
a
leader
exists
.

According
to
the
theory
,
"
what
an
individual
actually
does
when
acting
as
a
leader
is
in
large
part
dependent
upon
characteristics
of
the
situation
in
which
he
functions
.
"

Some
theorists
started
to
synthesize
the
trait
and
situational
approaches
.

Building
upon
the
research
of
Lewin
et
al.
,
academics
began
to
normalize
the
descriptive
models
of
leadership
climates
,
defining
three
leadership
styles
and
identifying
which
situations
each
style
works
better
in
.

The
authoritarian
leadership
style
,
for
example
,
is
approved
in
periods
of
crisis
but
fails
to
win
the
"
hearts
and
minds
"
of
followers
in
day-to-day
management
;
the
democratic
leadership
style
is
more
adequate
in
situations
that
require
consensus
building
;
finally
,
the
laissez-faire
leadership
style
is
appreciated
for
the
degree
of
freedom
it
provides
,
but
as
the
leaders
do
not
"
take
charge
"
,
they
can
be
perceived
as
a
failure
in
protracted
or
thorny
organizational
problems
.

Thus
,
theorists
defined
the
style
of
leadership
as
contingent
to
the
situation
,
which
is
sometimes
classified
as
contingency
theory
.

Four
contingency
leadership
theories
appear
more
prominently
in
recent
years
:
Fiedler
contingency
model
,
Vroom-Yetton
decision
model
,
the
path-goal
theory
,
and
the
Hersey-Blanchard
situational
theory
.

The
Fiedler
contingency
model
bases
the
leader
's
effectiveness
on
what
Fred
Fiedler
called
situational
contingency
.

This
results
from
the
interaction
of
leadership
style
and
situational
favorability
(
later
called
situational
control
)
.

The
theory
defined
two
types
of
leader
:
those
who
tend
to
accomplish
the
task
by
developing
good
relationships
with
the
group
(
relationship-oriented
)
,
and
those
who
have
as
their
prime
concern
carrying
out
the
task
itself
(
task-oriented
)
.

According
to
Fiedler
,
there
is
no
ideal
leader
.

Both
task-oriented
and
relationship-oriented
leaders
can
be
effective
if
their
leadership
orientation
fits
the
situation
.

When
there
is
a
good
leader-member
relation
,
a
highly
structured
task
,
and
high
leader
position
power
,
the
situation
is
considered
a
"
favorable
situation
"
.

Fiedler
found
that
task-oriented
leaders
are
more
effective
in
extremely
favorable
or
unfavorable
situations
,
whereas
relationship-oriented
leaders
perform
best
in
situations
with
intermediate
favorability
.

Victor
Vroom
,
in
collaboration
with
Phillip
Yetton
(
0000
)
and
later
with
Arthur
Jago
(
0000
)
,
developed
a
taxonomy
for
describing
leadership
situations
,
which
was
used
in
a
normative
decision
model
where
leadership
styles
were
connected
to
situational
variables
,
defining
which
approach
was
more
suitable
to
which
situation
.

This
approach
was
novel
because
it
supported
the
idea
that
the
same
manager
could
rely
on
different
group
decision
making
approaches
depending
on
the
attributes
of
each
situation
.

This
model
was
later
referred
to
as
situational
contingency
theory
.

The
path-goal
theory
of
leadership
was
developed
by
Robert
House
(
0000
)
and
was
based
on
the
expectancy
theory
of
Victor
Vroom
.

According
to
House
,
the
essence
of
the
theory
is
"
the
meta
proposition
that
leaders
,
to
be
effective
,
engage
in
behaviors
that
complement
subordinates
'
environments
and
abilities
in
a
manner
that
compensates
for
deficiencies
and
is
instrumental
to
subordinate
satisfaction
and
individual
and
work
unit
performance
"
.

The
theory
identifies
four
leader
behaviors
,
achievement-oriented
,
directive
,
participative
,
and
supportive
,
that
are
contingent
to
the
environment
factors
and
follower
characteristics
.

In
contrast
to
the
Fiedler
contingency
model
,
the
path-goal
model
states
that
the
four
leadership
behaviors
are
fluid
,
and
that
leaders
can
adopt
any
of
the
four
depending
on
what
the
situation
demands
.

The
path-goal
model
can
be
classified
both
as
a
contingency
theory
,
as
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
,
and
as
a
transactional
leadership
theory
,
as
the
theory
emphasizes
the
reciprocity
behavior
between
the
leader
and
the
followers
.

The
situational
leadership
model
proposed
by
Hersey
and
Blanchard
suggests
four
leadership-styles
and
four
levels
of
follower-development
.

For
effectiveness
,
the
model
posits
that
the
leadership-style
must
match
the
appropriate
level
of
follower-development
.

In
this
model
,
leadership
behavior
becomes
a
function
not
only
of
the
characteristics
of
the
leader
,
but
of
the
characteristics
of
followers
as
well
.

Functional
theory
Functional
leadership
theory
(
Hackman
&
Walton
,
0000
;
McGrath
,
0000
;
Adair
,
0000
;
Kouzes
&
Posner
,
0000
)
is
a
particularly
useful
theory
for
addressing
specific
leader
behaviors
expected
to
contribute
to
organizational
or
unit
effectiveness
.

This
theory
argues
that
the
leader
's
main
job
is
to
see
that
whatever
is
necessary
to
group
needs
is
taken
care
of
;
thus
,
a
leader
can
be
said
to
have
done
their
job
well
when
they
have
contributed
to
group
effectiveness
and
cohesion
(
Fleishman
et
al.
,
0000
;
Hackman
&
Wageman
,
0000
;
Hackman
&
Walton
,
0000
)
.

While
functional
leadership
theory
has
most
often
been
applied
to
team
leadership
(
Zaccaro
,
Rittman
,
&
Marks
,
0000
)
,
it
has
also
been
effectively
applied
to
broader
organizational
leadership
as
well
(
Zaccaro
,
0000
)
.

In
summarizing
literature
on
functional
leadership
(
see
Kozlowski
et
al.
(
0000
)
,
Zaccaro
et
al.
(
0000
)
,
Hackman
and
Walton
(
0000
)
,
Hackman
&
Wageman
(
0000
)
,
Morgeson
(
0000
)
)
,
Klein
,
Zeigert
,
Knight
,
and
Xiao
(
0000
)
observed
five
broad
functions
a
leader
performs
when
promoting
organization
's
effectiveness
.

These
functions
include
environmental
monitoring
,
organizing
subordinate
activities
,
teaching
and
coaching
subordinates
,
motivating
others
,
and
intervening
actively
in
the
group
's
work
.

A
variety
of
leadership
behaviors
are
expected
to
facilitate
these
functions
.

In
initial
work
identifying
leader
behavior
,
Fleishman
(
0000
)
observed
that
subordinates
perceived
their
supervisors
'
behavior
in
terms
of
two
broad
categories
referred
to
as
consideration
and
initiating
structure
.

Consideration
includes
behavior
involved
in
fostering
effective
relationships
.

Examples
of
such
behavior
would
include
showing
concern
for
a
subordinate
or
acting
in
a
supportive
manner
towards
others
.

Initiating
structure
involves
the
actions
of
the
leader
focused
specifically
on
task
accomplishment
.

This
could
include
role
clarification
,
setting
performance
standards
,
and
holding
subordinates
accountable
to
those
standards
.

Integrated
psychological
theory
The
Integrated
Psychological
theory
of
leadership
is
an
attempt
to
integrate
the
strengths
of
the
older
theories
(
i.e.
traits
,
behavioral/styles
,
situational
and
functional
)
while
addressing
their
limitations
,
largely
by
introducing
a
new
element
–
the
need
for
leaders
to
develop
their
leadership
presence
,
attitude
toward
others
and
behavioral
flexibility
by
practicing
psychological
mastery
.

It
also
offers
a
foundation
for
leaders
wanting
to
apply
the
philosophies
of
servant
leadership
and
“
authentic
leadership
”
.

Integrated
Psychological
theory
began
to
attract
attention
after
the
publication
of
James
Scouller
’s
Three
Levels
of
Leadership
model
(
0000
)
.

Scouller
argued
that
the
older
theories
offer
only
limited
assistance
in
developing
a
person
’s
ability
to
lead
effectively
.

He
pointed
out
,
for
example
,
that
:
Scouller
therefore
proposed
the
Three
Levels
of
Leadership
model
,
which
was
later
categorized
as
an
“
Integrated
Psychological
”
theory
on
the
Businessballs
education
website
.

In
essence
,
his
model
summarizes
what
leaders
have
to
do
,
not
only
to
bring
leadership
to
their
group
or
organization
,
but
also
to
develop
themselves
technically
and
psychologically
as
leaders
.

The
three
levels
in
his
model
are
Public
,
Private
and
Personal
leadership
:
Scouller
argued
that
self-mastery
is
the
key
to
growing
one
’s
leadership
presence
,
building
trusting
relationships
with
followers
and
dissolving
one
’s
limiting
beliefs
and
habits
,
thereby
enabling
behavioral
flexibility
as
circumstances
change
,
while
staying
connected
to
one
’s
core
values
(
that
is
,
while
remaining
authentic
)
.

To
support
leaders
’
development
,
he
introduced
a
new
model
of
the
human
psyche
and
outlined
the
principles
and
techniques
of
self-mastery
.

Transactional
and
transformational
theories
Eric
Berne
first
analyzed
the
relations
between
a
group
and
its
leadership
in
terms
of
transactional
analysis
.

The
transactional
leader
(
Burns
,
0000
)
is
given
power
to
perform
certain
tasks
and
reward
or
punish
for
the
team
's
performance
.

It
gives
the
opportunity
to
the
manager
to
lead
the
group
and
the
group
agrees
to
follow
his
lead
to
accomplish
a
predetermined
goal
in
exchange
for
something
else
.

Power
is
given
to
the
leader
to
evaluate
,
correct
,
and
train
subordinates
when
productivity
is
not
up
to
the
desired
level
,
and
reward
effectiveness
when
expected
outcome
is
reached
.

Idiosyncrasy
Credits
,
first
posited
by
Edward
Hollander
(
0000
)
is
one
example
of
a
concept
closely
related
to
transactional
leadership
.

Leader
–
member
exchange
theory
Another
theory
that
addresses
a
specific
aspect
of
the
leadership
process
is
the
leader
–
member
exchange
(
LMX
)
theory
,
which
evolved
from
an
earlier
theory
called
the
vertical
dyad
linkage
(
VDL
)
model
.

Both
of
these
models
focus
on
the
interaction
between
leaders
and
individual
followers
.

Similar
to
the
transactional
approach
,
this
interaction
is
viewed
as
a
fair
exchange
whereby
the
leader
provides
certain
benefits
such
as
task
guidance
,
advice
,
support
,
and/or
significant
rewards
and
the
followers
reciprocate
by
giving
the
leader
respect
,
cooperation
,
commitment
to
the
task
and
good
performance
.

However
,
LMX
recognizes
that
leaders
and
individual
followers
will
vary
in
the
type
of
exchange
that
develops
between
them
.

LMX
theorizes
that
the
type
of
exchanges
between
the
leader
and
specific
followers
can
lead
to
the
creation
of
in-groups
and
out-groups
.

In-group
members
are
said
to
have
high-quality
exchanges
with
the
leader
,
while
out-group
members
have
low-quality
exchanges
with
the
leader
.

In-group
members
In-group
members
are
perceived
by
the
leader
as
being
more
experienced
,
competent
,
and
willing
to
assume
responsibility
than
other
followers
.

The
leader
begins
to
rely
on
these
individuals
to
help
with
especially
challenging
tasks
.

If
the
follower
responds
well
,
the
leader
rewards
him/her
with
extra
coaching
,
favorable
job
assignments
,
and
developmental
experiences
.

If
the
follower
shows
high
commitment
and
effort
followed
by
additional
rewards
,
both
parties
develop
mutual
trust
,
influence
,
and
support
of
one
another
.

Research
shows
the
in-group
members
usually
receive
higher
performance
evaluations
from
the
leader
,
higher
satisfaction
,
and
faster
promotions
than
out-group
members
.

In-group
members
are
also
likely
to
build
stronger
bonds
with
their
leaders
by
sharing
the
same
social
backgrounds
and
interests
.

Out-group
members
Out-group
members
often
receive
less
time
and
more
distant
exchanges
then
their
in-group
counterparts
.

With
out-group
members
,
leaders
expect
no
more
than
adequate
job
performance
,
good
attendance
,
reasonable
respect
,
and
adherence
to
the
job
description
in
exchange
for
a
fair
wage
and
standard
benefits
.

The
leader
spends
less
time
with
out-group
members
,
they
have
fewer
developmental
experiences
,
and
the
leader
tends
to
emphasize
his/her
formal
authority
to
obtain
compliance
to
leader
requests
.

Research
shows
that
out-group
members
are
less
satisfied
with
their
job
and
organization
,
receive
lower
performance
evaluations
from
the
leader
,
see
their
leader
as
less
fair
,
and
are
more
likely
to
file
grievances
or
leave
the
organization
.

Emotions
Leadership
can
be
perceived
as
a
particularly
emotion-laden
process
,
with
emotions
entwined
with
the
social
influence
process
.

In
an
organization
,
the
leader
's
mood
has
some
effects
on
his/her
group
.

These
effects
can
be
described
in
three
levels
:
In
research
about
client
service
,
it
was
found
that
expressions
of
positive
mood
by
the
leader
improve
the
performance
of
the
group
,
although
in
other
sectors
there
were
other
findings
.

Beyond
the
leader
's
mood
,
her/his
behavior
is
a
source
for
employee
positive
and
negative
emotions
at
work
.

The
leader
creates
situations
and
events
that
lead
to
emotional
response
.

Certain
leader
behaviors
displayed
during
interactions
with
their
employees
are
the
sources
of
these
affective
events
.

Leaders
shape
workplace
affective
events
.

Examples
–
feedback
giving
,
allocating
tasks
,
resource
distribution
.

Since
employee
behavior
and
productivity
are
directly
affected
by
their
emotional
states
,
it
is
imperative
to
consider
employee
emotional
responses
to
organizational
leaders
.

Emotional
intelligence
,
the
ability
to
understand
and
manage
moods
and
emotions
in
the
self
and
others
,
contributes
to
effective
leadership
within
organizations
.

Neo-emergent
theory
The
neo-emergent
leadership
theory
(
from
the
Oxford
school
of
leadership
)
espouses
that
leadership
is
created
through
the
emergence
of
information
by
the
leader
or
other
stakeholders
,
not
through
the
true
actions
of
the
leader
himself
.

In
other
words
,
the
reproduction
of
information
or
stories
form
the
basis
of
the
perception
of
leadership
by
the
majority
.

It
is
well
known
that
the
great
naval
hero
Lord
Nelson
often
wrote
his
own
versions
of
battles
he
was
involved
in
,
so
that
when
he
arrived
home
in
England
he
would
receive
a
true
hero
's
welcome
.

In
modern
society
,
the
press
,
blogs
and
other
sources
report
their
own
views
of
a
leader
,
which
may
be
based
on
reality
,
but
may
also
be
based
on
a
political
command
,
a
payment
,
or
an
inherent
interest
of
the
author
,
media
,
or
leader
.

Therefore
,
it
can
be
contended
that
the
perception
of
all
leaders
is
created
and
in
fact
does
not
reflect
their
true
leadership
qualities
at
all
.

Styles
A
leadership
style
is
a
leader
's
style
of
providing
direction
,
implementing
plans
,
and
motivating
people
.

It
is
the
result
of
the
philosophy
,
personality
,
and
experience
of
the
leader
.

Rhetoric
specialists
have
also
developed
models
for
understanding
leadership
(
Robert
Hariman
,
Political
Style
,
Philippe-Joseph
Salazar
,
L'Hyperpolitique
.

De
La
Domination
)
.

Different
situations
call
for
different
leadership
styles
.

In
an
emergency
when
there
is
little
time
to
converge
on
an
agreement
and
where
a
designated
authority
has
significantly
more
experience
or
expertise
than
the
rest
of
the
team
,
an
autocratic
leadership
style
may
be
most
effective
;
however
,
in
a
highly
motivated
and
aligned
team
with
a
homogeneous
level
of
expertise
,
a
more
democratic
or
laissez-faire
style
may
be
more
effective
.

The
style
adopted
should
be
the
one
that
most
effectively
achieves
the
objectives
of
the
group
while
balancing
the
interests
of
its
individual
members
.

Engaging
style
Engaging
as
part
of
leadership
style
has
been
mentioned
in
various
literature
earlier
.

Dr.
Stephen
L.
Cohen
,
the
Senior
Vice
President
for
Right
Management
’s
Leadership
Development
Center
of
Excellence
,
has
in
his
article
Four
Key
Leadership
Practices
for
Leading
in
Tough
Times
has
mentioned
Engagement
as
the
fourth
Key
practice
.

He
writes
,
"
these
initiatives
do
for
the
organization
is
engage
both
leaders
and
employees
in
understanding
the
existing
conditions
and
how
they
can
collectively
assist
in
addressing
them
.

Reaching
out
to
employees
during
difficult
times
to
better
understand
their
concerns
and
interests
by
openly
and
honestly
conveying
the
impact
of
the
downturn
on
them
and
their
organizations
can
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
not
only
engaging
them
but
retaining
them
when
things
do
turn
around
.

Engagement
as
the
key
to
Collaborative
Leadership
is
also
emphasized
in
several
original
research
papers
and
programs
.

Becoming
an
agile
has
long
been
associated
with
Engaging
leaders
-
rather
than
leadership
with
a
hands-off
approach
.

Autocratic
or
authoritarian
style
Under
the
autocratic
leadership
style
,
all
decision-making
powers
are
centralized
in
the
leader
,
as
with
dictator
s.
Leaders
do
not
entertain
any
suggestions
or
initiatives
from
subordinates
.

The
autocratic
management
has
been
successful
as
it
provides
strong
motivation
to
the
manager
.

It
permits
quick
decision-making
,
as
only
one
person
decides
for
the
whole
group
and
keeps
each
decision
to
him/herself
until
he/she
feels
it
needs
to
be
shared
with
the
rest
of
the
group
.

Participative
or
democratic
style
The
democratic
leadership
style
consists
of
the
leader
sharing
the
decision-making
abilities
with
group
members
by
promoting
the
interests
of
the
group
members
and
by
practicing
social
equality
.

This
has
also
been
called
shared
leadership
.

Laissez-faire
or
free-rein
style
A
person
may
be
in
a
leadership
position
without
providing
leadership
,
leaving
the
group
to
fend
for
itself
.

Subordinates
are
given
a
free
hand
in
deciding
their
own
policies
and
methods
.

The
subordinates
are
motivated
to
be
creative
and
innovative
.

Narcissistic
leadership
Narcissistic
leadership
is
a
leadership
style
in
which
the
leader
is
only
interested
in
him/herself
.

Their
priority
is
themselves
-
at
the
expense
of
their
people/group
members
.

This
leader
exhibits
the
characteristics
of
a
narcissist
:
arrogance
,
dominance
and
hostility
.

It
is
a
common
leadership
style
.

The
narcissism
may
range
from
anywhere
between
healthy
and
destructive
.

To
critics
,
"
narcissistic
leadership
(
preferably
destructive
)
is
driven
by
unyielding
arrogance
,
self-absorption
,
and
a
personal
egotistic
need
for
power
and
admiration
.
"

Toxic
leadership
A
toxic
leader
is
someone
who
has
responsibility
over
a
group
of
people
or
an
organization
,
and
who
abuses
the
leader
–
follower
relationship
by
leaving
the
group
or
organization
in
a
worse-off
condition
than
when
he/she
joined
it
.

Task-oriented
and
relationship-oriented
leadership
Task-oriented
leadership
is
a
style
in
which
the
leader
is
focused
on
the
tasks
that
need
to
be
performed
in
order
to
meet
a
certain
production
goal
.

Task-oriented
leaders
are
generally
more
concerned
with
producing
a
step-by-step
solution
for
given
problem
or
goal
,
strictly
making
sure
these
deadlines
are
met
,
results
and
reaching
target
outcomes
.

Relationship-oriented
leadership
is
a
contrasting
style
in
which
the
leader
is
more
focused
on
the
relationships
amongst
the
group
and
is
generally
more
concerned
with
the
overall
well-being
and
satisfaction
of
group
members
.

Relationship-oriented
leaders
emphasize
communication
within
the
group
,
shows
trust
and
confidence
in
group
members
,
and
shows
appreciation
for
work
done
.

Task-oriented
leaders
are
typically
less
concerned
with
the
idea
of
catering
to
group
members
,
and
more
concerned
with
acquiring
a
certain
solution
to
meet
a
production
goal
.

For
this
reason
,
they
typically
are
able
to
make
sure
that
deadlines
are
met
,
yet
their
group
members
'
well-being
may
suffer
.

Relationship-oriented
leaders
are
focused
on
developing
the
team
and
the
relationships
in
it
.

The
positives
to
having
this
kind
of
environment
are
that
team
members
are
more
motivated
and
have
support
,
however
,
the
emphasis
on
relations
as
opposed
to
getting
a
job
done
might
make
productivity
suffer
.

Sex
differences
in
leadership
behavior
Another
factor
that
covaries
with
leadership
style
is
whether
the
person
is
male
or
female
.

When
men
and
women
come
together
in
groups
,
they
tend
to
adopt
different
leadership
styles
.

Men
generally
assume
an
agentic
leadership
style
.

They
are
task-oriented
,
active
,
decision
focused
,
independent
and
goal
oriented
.

Women
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
generally
more
communal
when
they
assume
a
leadership
position
;
they
strive
to
be
helpful
towards
others
,
warm
in
relation
to
others
,
understanding
,
and
mindful
of
others
'
feelings
.

In
general
,
when
women
are
asked
to
describe
themselves
to
others
in
newly
formed
groups
,
they
emphasize
their
open
,
fair
,
responsible
,
and
pleasant
communal
qualities
.

They
give
advice
,
offer
assurances
,
and
manage
conflicts
in
an
attempt
to
maintain
positive
relationships
among
group
members
.

Women
connect
more
positively
to
group
members
by
smiling
,
maintaining
eye
contact
and
respond
tactfully
to
others
’
comments
.

Men
,
conversely
,
describe
themselves
as
influential
,
powerful
and
proficient
at
the
task
that
needs
to
be
done
.

They
tend
to
place
more
focus
on
initiating
structure
within
the
group
,
setting
standards
and
objectives
,
identifying
roles
,
defining
responsibilities
and
standard
operating
procedures
,
proposing
solutions
to
problems
,
monitoring
compliance
with
procedures
,
and
finally
,
emphasizing
the
need
for
productivity
and
efficiency
in
the
work
that
needs
to
be
done
.

As
leaders
,
men
are
primarily
task-oriented
,
but
women
tend
to
be
both
task
-
and
relationship-oriented
.

However
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
these
sex
differences
are
only
tendencies
,
and
do
not
manifest
themselves
within
men
and
women
across
all
groups
and
situations
.

Performance
In
the
past
,
some
researchers
have
argued
that
the
actual
influence
of
leaders
on
organizational
outcomes
is
overrated
and
romanticized
as
a
result
of
biased
attributions
about
leaders
(
Meindl
&
Ehrlich
,
0000
)
.

Despite
these
assertions
,
however
,
it
is
largely
recognized
and
accepted
by
practitioners
and
researchers
that
leadership
is
important
,
and
research
supports
the
notion
that
leaders
do
contribute
to
key
organizational
outcomes
(
Day
&
Lord
,
0000
;
Kaiser
,
Hogan
,
&
Craig
,
0000
)
.

To
facilitate
successful
performance
it
is
important
to
understand
and
accurately
measure
leadership
performance
.

Job
performance
generally
refers
to
behavior
that
is
expected
to
contribute
to
organizational
success
(
Campbell
,
0000
)
.

Campbell
identified
a
number
of
specific
types
of
performance
dimensions
;
leadership
was
one
of
the
dimensions
that
he
identified
.

There
is
no
consistent
,
overall
definition
of
leadership
performance
(
Yukl
,
0000
)
.

Many
distinct
conceptualizations
are
often
lumped
together
under
the
umbrella
of
leadership
performance
,
including
outcomes
such
as
leader
effectiveness
,
leader
advancement
,
and
leader
emergence
(
Kaiser
et
al.
,
0000
)
.

For
instance
,
leadership
performance
may
be
used
to
refer
to
the
career
success
of
the
individual
leader
,
performance
of
the
group
or
organization
,
or
even
leader
emergence
.

Each
of
these
measures
can
be
considered
conceptually
distinct
.

While
these
aspects
may
be
related
,
they
are
different
outcomes
and
their
inclusion
should
depend
on
the
applied
or
research
focus
.

Leadership
traits
Most
theories
in
the
00th
century
argued
that
great
leaders
were
born
,
not
made
.

Current
studies
have
indicated
that
leadership
is
much
more
complex
and
can
not
be
boiled
down
to
a
few
key
traits
of
an
individual
.

Years
of
observation
and
study
have
indicated
that
one
such
trait
or
a
set
of
traits
does
not
make
an
extraordinary
leader
.

What
scholars
have
been
able
to
arrive
at
is
that
leadership
traits
of
an
individual
do
not
change
from
situation
to
situation
;
such
traits
include
intelligence
,
assertiveness
,
or
physical
attractiveness
.

However
,
each
key
trait
may
be
applied
to
situations
differently
,
depending
on
the
circumstances
.

The
following
summarizes
the
main
leadership
traits
found
in
research
by
Jon
P.
Howell
,
business
professor
at
New
Mexico
State
University
and
author
of
the
book
Snapshots
of
Great
Leadership
.

Determination
and
drive
include
traits
such
as
initiative
,
energy
,
assertiveness
,
perseverance
,
masculinity
,
and
sometimes
dominance
.

People
with
these
traits
often
tend
to
wholeheartedly
pursue
their
goals
,
work
long
hours
,
are
ambitious
,
and
often
are
very
competitive
with
others
.

Cognitive
capacity
includes
intelligence
,
analytical
and
verbal
ability
,
behavioral
flexibility
,
and
good
judgment
.

Individuals
with
these
traits
are
able
to
formulate
solutions
to
difficult
problems
,
work
well
under
stress
or
deadlines
,
adapt
to
changing
situations
,
and
create
well-thought-out
plans
for
the
future
.

Howell
provides
examples
of
Steve
Jobs
and
Abraham
Lincoln
as
encompassing
the
traits
of
determination
and
drive
as
well
as
possessing
cognitive
capacity
,
demonstrated
by
their
ability
to
adapt
to
their
continuously
changing
environments
.

Self-confidence
encompasses
the
traits
of
high
self-esteem
,
assertiveness
,
emotional
stability
,
and
self-assurance
.

Individuals
that
are
self-confident
do
not
doubt
themselves
or
their
abilities
and
decisions
;
they
also
have
the
ability
to
project
this
self-confidence
onto
others
,
building
their
trust
and
commitment
.

Integrity
is
demonstrated
in
individuals
who
are
truthful
,
trustworthy
,
principled
,
consistent
,
dependent
,
loyal
,
and
not
deceptive
.

Leaders
with
integrity
often
share
these
values
with
their
followers
,
as
this
trait
is
mainly
an
ethics
issue
.

It
is
often
said
that
these
leaders
keep
their
word
and
are
honest
and
open
with
their
cohorts
.

Sociability
describes
individuals
who
are
friendly
,
extroverted
,
tactful
,
flexible
,
and
interpersonally
competent
.

Such
a
trait
enables
leaders
to
be
accepted
well
by
the
public
,
use
diplomatic
measures
to
solve
issues
,
as
well
as
hold
the
ability
to
adapt
their
social
persona
to
the
situation
at
hand
.

According
to
Howell
,
Mother
Teresa
is
an
exceptional
example
that
embodies
integrity
,
assertiveness
,
and
social
abilities
in
her
diplomatic
dealings
with
the
leaders
of
the
world
.

Few
great
leaders
encompass
all
of
the
traits
listed
above
,
but
many
have
the
ability
to
apply
a
number
of
them
to
succeed
as
front-runners
of
their
organization
or
situation
.

The
ontological
–
phenomenological
model
for
leadership
One
of
the
more
recent
definitions
of
leadership
comes
from
Werner
Erhard
,
Michael
C.
Jensen
,
Steve
Zaffron
,
and
Kari
Granger
who
describe
leadership
as
“
an
exercise
in
language
that
results
in
the
realization
of
a
future
that
was
n’t
going
to
happen
anyway
,
which
future
fulfills
(
or
contributes
to
fulfilling
)
the
concerns
of
the
relevant
parties
…
”
.

This
definition
ensures
that
leadership
is
talking
about
the
future
and
includes
the
fundamental
concerns
of
the
relevant
parties
.

This
differs
from
relating
to
the
relevant
parties
as
“
followers
”
and
calling
up
an
image
of
a
single
leader
with
others
following
.

Rather
,
a
future
that
fulfills
on
the
fundamental
concerns
of
the
relevant
parties
indicates
the
future
that
was
n’t
going
to
happen
is
not
the
“
idea
of
the
leader
”
,
but
rather
is
what
emerges
from
digging
deep
to
find
the
underlying
concerns
of
those
who
are
impacted
by
the
leadership
.

Contexts
Organizations
An
organization
that
is
established
as
an
instrument
or
means
for
achieving
defined
objectives
has
been
referred
to
as
a
formal
organization
.

Its
design
specifies
how
goals
are
subdivided
and
reflected
in
subdivisions
of
the
organization
.

Divisions
,
departments
,
sections
,
positions
,
jobs
,
and
tasks
make
up
this
work
structure
.

Thus
,
the
formal
organization
is
expected
to
behave
impersonally
in
regard
to
relationships
with
clients
or
with
its
members
.

According
to
Weber
's
definition
,
entry
and
subsequent
advancement
is
by
merit
or
seniority
.

Employees
receive
a
salary
and
enjoy
a
degree
of
tenure
that
safeguards
them
from
the
arbitrary
influence
of
superiors
or
of
powerful
clients
.

The
higher
one
's
position
in
the
hierarchy
,
the
greater
one
's
presumed
expertise
in
adjudicating
problems
that
may
arise
in
the
course
of
the
work
carried
out
at
lower
levels
of
the
organization
.

It
is
this
bureaucratic
structure
that
forms
the
basis
for
the
appointment
of
heads
or
chiefs
of
administrative
subdivisions
in
the
organization
and
endows
them
with
the
authority
attached
to
their
position
.

In
contrast
to
the
appointed
head
or
chief
of
an
administrative
unit
,
a
leader
emerges
within
the
context
of
the
informal
organization
that
underlies
the
formal
structure
.

The
informal
organization
expresses
the
personal
objectives
and
goal
s
of
the
individual
.

Their
objectives
and
goals
may
or
may
not
coincide
with
those
of
the
formal
organization
.

The
informal
organization
represents
an
extension
of
the
social
structures
that
generally
characterize
human
life
—
the
spontaneous
emergence
of
groups
and
organizations
as
ends
in
themselves
.

In
prehistoric
times
,
humanity
was
preoccupied
with
personal
security
,
maintenance
,
protection
,
and
survival
.

Now
humanity
spends
a
major
portion
of
waking
hours
working
for
organizations
.

The
need
to
identify
with
a
community
that
provides
security
,
protection
,
maintenance
,
and
a
feeling
of
belonging
has
continued
unchanged
from
prehistoric
times
.

This
need
is
met
by
the
informal
organization
and
its
emergent
,
or
unofficial
,
leaders
.

Leaders
emerge
from
within
the
structure
of
the
informal
organization
.

Their
personal
qualities
,
the
demands
of
the
situation
,
or
a
combination
of
these
and
other
factors
attract
followers
who
accept
their
leadership
within
one
or
several
overlay
structures
.

Instead
of
the
authority
of
position
held
by
an
appointed
head
or
chief
,
the
emergent
leader
wields
influence
or
power
.

Influence
is
the
ability
of
a
person
to
gain
co-operation
from
others
by
means
of
persuasion
or
control
over
rewards
.

Power
is
a
stronger
form
of
influence
because
it
reflects
a
person
's
ability
to
enforce
action
through
the
control
of
a
means
of
punishment
.

A
leader
is
a
person
who
influences
a
group
of
people
towards
a
specific
result
.

It
is
not
dependent
on
title
or
formal
authority
.

(
Elevos

paraphrased
from
Leaders
,
Bennis
,
and
Leadership
Presence
,
Halpern
&
Lubar
.
)

Ogbonnia
(
0000
)
defines
an
effective
leader
"
as
an
individual
with
the
capacity
to
consistently
succeed
in
a
given
condition
and
be
viewed
as
meeting
the
expectations
of
an
organization
or
society
.
"

Leaders
are
recognized
by
their
capacity
for
caring
for
others
,
clear
communication
,
and
a
commitment
to
persist
.

An
individual
who
is
appointed
to
a
managerial
position
has
the
right
to
command
and
enforce
obedience
by
virtue
of
the
authority
of
their
position
.

However
,
she
or
he
must
possess
adequate
personal
attributes
to
match
this
authority
,
because
authority
is
only
potentially
available
to
him/her
.

In
the
absence
of
sufficient
personal
competence
,
a
manager
may
be
confronted
by
an
emergent
leader
who
can
challenge
her/his
role
in
the
organization
and
reduce
it
to
that
of
a
figurehead
.

However
,
only
authority
of
position
has
the
backing
of
formal
sanctions
.

It
follows
that
whoever
wields
personal
influence
and
power
can
legitimize
this
only
by
gaining
a
formal
position
in
the
hierarchy
,
with
commensurate
authority
.

Leadership
can
be
defined
as
one
's
ability
to
get
others
to
willingly
follow
.

Every
organization
needs
leaders
at
every
level
.

Management
Over
the
years
the
philosophical
terminology
of
"
management
"
and
"
leadership
"
have
,
in
the
organizational
context
,
been
used
both
as
synonyms
and
with
clearly
differentiated
meanings
.

Debate
is
fairly
common
about
whether
the
use
of
these
terms
should
be
restricted
,
and
generally
reflects
an
awareness
of
the
distinction
made
by
Burns
(
0000
)
between
"
transactional
"
leadership
(
characterized
by
e.g.
emphasis
on
procedures
,
contingent
reward
,
management
by
exception
)
and
"
transformational
"
leadership
(
characterized
by
e.g.
charisma
,
personal
relationships
,
creativity
)
.

Group
leadership
In
contrast
to
individual
leadership
,
some
organizations
have
adopted
group
leadership
.

In
this
situation
,
more
than
one
person
provides
direction
to
the
group
as
a
whole
.

Some
organizations
have
taken
this
approach
in
hopes
of
increasing
creativity
,
reducing
costs
,
or
downsizing
.

Others
may
see
the
traditional
leadership
of
a
as
costing
too
much
in
team
performance
.

In
some
situations
,
the
team
members
best
able
to
handle
any
given
phase
of
the
project
become
the
temporary
leaders
.

Additionally
,
as
each
team
member
has
the
opportunity
to
experience
the
elevated
level
of
empowerment
,
it
energizes
staff
and
feeds
the
cycle
of
success
.

Leaders
who
demonstrate
persistence
,
tenacity
,
determination
,
and
synergistic
communication
skills
will
bring
out
the
same
qualities
in
their
groups
.

Good
leaders
use
their
own
inner
mentors
to
energize
their
team
and
organizations
and
lead
a
team
to
achieve
success
.

According
to
the
National
School
Boards
Association
(
USA
)
:
These
Group
Leaderships
or
Leadership
Teams
have
specific
characteristics
:
Characteristics
of
a
Team
Ten
characteristics
of
well-functioning
teams
:
Self-leadership
Self-leadership
is
a
process
that
occurs
within
an
individual
,
rather
than
an
external
act
.

It
is
an
expression
of
who
we
are
as
people
.

Primates
Mark
van
Vugt
and
Anjana
Ahuja
in
Naturally
Selected
:
The
Evolutionary
Science
of
Leadership
present
evidence
of
leadership
in
nonhuman
animals
,
from
ants
and
bees
to
baboons
and
chimpanzees
.

They
suggest
that
leadership
has
a
long
evolutionary
history
and
that
the
same
mechanisms
underpinning
leadership
in
humans
can
be
found
in
other
social
species
,
too
.

Richard
Wrangham
and
Dale
Peterson
,
in
Demonic
Males
:
Apes
and
the
Origins
of
Human
Violence
,
present
evidence
that
only
humans
and
chimpanzee
s
,
among
all
the
animal
s
living
on
Earth
,
share
a
similar
tendency
for
a
cluster
of
behaviors
:
violence
,
territoriality
,
and
competition
for
uniting
behind
the
one
chief
male
of
the
land
.

This
position
is
contentious
.

Many
animals
beyond
apes
are
territorial
,
compete
,
exhibit
violence
,
and
have
a
social
structure
controlled
by
a
dominant
male
(
lions
,
wolves
,
etc.
)
,
suggesting
Wrangham
and
Peterson
's
evidence
is
not
empirical
.

However
,
we
must
examine
other
species
as
well
,
including
elephants
(
which
are
matriarchal
and
follow
an
alpha
female
)
,
meerkats
(
who
are
likewise
matriarchal
)
,
and
many
others
.

By
comparison
,
bonobo
s
,
the
second-closest
species-relatives
of
humans
,
do
not
unite
behind
the
chief
male
of
the
land
.

The
bonobos
show
deference
to
an
alpha
or
top-ranking
female
that
,
with
the
support
of
her
coalition
of
other
females
,
can
prove
as
strong
as
the
strongest
male
.

Thus
,
if
leadership
amounts
to
getting
the
greatest
number
of
followers
,
then
among
the
bonobos
,
a
female
almost
always
exerts
the
strongest
and
most
effective
leadership
.

However
,
not
all
scientists
agree
on
the
allegedly
peaceful
nature
of
the
bonobo
or
its
reputation
as
a
"
hippie
chimp
"
.

Historical
views
Sanskrit
literature
identifies
ten
types
of
leaders
.

Defining
characteristics
of
the
ten
types
of
leaders
are
explained
with
examples
from
history
and
mythology
.

Aristocratic
thinkers
have
postulated
that
leadership
depends
on
one
's
"
blue
blood
"
or
gene
s.
Monarchy
takes
an
extreme
view
of
the
same
idea
,
and
may
prop
up
its
assertions
against
the
claims
of
mere
aristocrats
by
invoking
divine
sanction
(
see
the
divine
right
of
kings
)
.

Contrariwise
,
more
democratically-inclined
theorists
have
pointed
to
examples
of
meritocratic
leaders
,
such
as
the
Napoleonic
marshals
profiting
from
career
s
open
to
talent
.

In
the
autocratic
/
paternalistic
strain
of
thought
,
traditionalists
recall
the
role
of
leadership
of
the
Roman
pater
familias
.

Feminist
thinking
,
on
the
other
hand
,
may
object
to
such
models
as
patriarchal
and
posit
against
them
emotionally-attuned
,
responsive
,
and
consensual
empathetic
guidance
,
which
is
sometimes
associated
with
matriarchies
.

Comparable
to
the
Roman
tradition
,
the
views
of
Confucianism
on
"
right
living
"
relate
very
much
to
the
ideal
of
the
(
male
)
scholar-leader
and
his
benevolent
rule
,
buttressed
by
a
tradition
of
filial
piety
.

Leadership
is
a
matter
of
intelligence
,
trustworthiness
,
humaneness
,
courage
,
and
discipline
.
.
.
Reliance
on
intelligence
alone
results
in
rebelliousness
.

Exercise
of
humaneness
alone
results
in
weakness
.

Fixation
on
trust
results
in
folly
.

Dependence
on
the
strength
of
courage
results
in
violence
.

Excessive
discipline
and
sternness
in
command
result
in
cruelty
.

When
one
has
all
five
virtues
together
,
each
appropriate
to
its
function
,
then
one
can
be
a
leader
.

—
Sun
Tzu
In
the
00th
century
,
the
elaboration
of
anarchist
thought
called
the
whole
concept
of
leadership
into
question
.

(
Note
that
the
Oxford
English
Dictionary
traces
the
word
"
leadership
"
in
English
only
as
far
back
as
the
00th
century
.
)

One
response
to
this
denial
of
élitism
came
with
Leninism
,
which
demanded
an
élite
group
of
disciplined
cadres
to
act
as
the
vanguard
of
a
socialist
revolution
,
bringing
into
existence
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
.

Other
historical
views
of
leadership
have
addressed
the
seeming
contrasts
between
secular
and
religious
leadership
.

The
doctrines
of
Caesaro-papism
have
recurred
and
had
their
detractors
over
several
centuries
.

Christian
thinking
on
leadership
has
often
emphasized
stewardship
of
divinely-provided
resources
—
human
and
material
—
and
their
deployment
in
accordance
with
a
Divine
plan
.

For
a
more
general
take
on
leadership
in
politics
,
compare
the
concept
of
the
statesperson
.

Leadership
myths
Leadership
,
although
largely
talked
about
,
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
least
understood
concepts
across
all
cultures
and
civilizations
.

Over
the
years
,
many
researchers
have
stressed
the
prevalence
of
this
misunderstanding
,
stating
that
the
existence
of
several
flawed
assumptions
,
or
myths
,
concerning
leadership
often
interferes
with
individuals
’
conception
of
what
leadership
is
all
about
(
Gardner
,
0000
;
Bennis
,
0000
)
.

Leadership
is
innate
According
to
some
,
leadership
is
determined
by
distinctive
dispositional
characteristics
present
at
birth
(
e.g.
,
extraversion
;
intelligence
;
ingenuity
)
.

However
,
according
to
Forsyth
(
0000
)
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
leadership
also
develops
through
hard
work
and
careful
observation
.

Thus
,
effective
leadership
can
result
from
nature
(
i.e.
,
innate
talents
)
as
well
as
nurture
(
i.e.
,
acquired
skills
)
.

Leadership
is
possessing
power
over
others
Although
leadership
is
certainly
a
form
of
power
,
it
is
not
demarcated
by
power
over
people
–
rather
,
it
is
a
power
with
people
that
exists
as
a
reciprocal
relationship
between
a
leader
and
his/her
followers
(
Forsyth
,
0000
)
.

Despite
popular
belief
,
the
use
of
manipulation
,
coercion
,
and
domination
to
influence
others
is
not
a
requirement
for
leadership
.

In
actuality
,
individuals
who
seek
group
consent
and
strive
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
others
can
also
become
effective
leaders
(
e.g.
,
class
president
;
court
judge
)
.

Leaders
are
positively
influential
The
validity
of
the
assertion
that
groups
flourish
when
guided
by
effective
leaders
can
be
illustrated
using
several
examples
.

For
instance
,
according
to
Baumeister
et
al.
(
0000
)
,
the
bystander
effect
(
failure
to
respond
or
offer
assistance
)
that
tends
to
develop
within
groups
faced
with
an
emergency
is
significantly
reduced
in
groups
guided
by
a
leader
.

Moreover
,
it
has
been
documented
that
group
performance
,
creativity
,
and
efficiency
all
tend
to
climb
in
businesses
with
designated
managers
or
CEOs
.

However
,
the
difference
leaders
make
is
not
always
positive
in
nature
.

Leaders
sometimes
focus
on
fulfilling
their
own
agendas
at
the
expense
of
others
,
including
his/her
own
followers
(
e.g.
,
Pol
Pot
;
Josef
Stalin
)
.

Leaders
who
focus
on
personal
gain
by
employing
stringent
and
manipulative
leadership
styles
often
make
a
difference
,
but
usually
do
so
through
negative
means
.

Leaders
entirely
control
group
outcomes
In
Western
culture
s
it
is
generally
assumed
that
group
leaders
make
all
the
difference
when
it
comes
to
group
influence
and
overall
goal-attainment
.

Although
common
,
this
romanticized
view
of
leadership
(
i.e.
,
the
tendency
to
overestimate
the
degree
of
control
leaders
have
over
their
groups
and
their
groups
’
outcomes
)
ignores
the
existence
of
many
other
factors
that
influence
group
dynamics
.

For
example
,
group
cohesion
,
communication
patterns
among
members
,
individual
personality
traits
,
group
context
,
the
nature
or
orientation
of
the
work
,
as
well
as
behavioral
norms
and
established
standards
influence
group
functionality
in
varying
capacities
.

For
this
reason
,
it
is
unwarranted
to
assume
that
all
leaders
are
in
complete
control
of
their
groups
'
achievements
.

All
groups
have
a
designated
leader
Despite
preconceived
notions
,
not
all
groups
need
have
a
designated
leader
.

Groups
that
are
primarily
composed
of
women
,
are
limited
in
size
,
are
free
from
stressful
decision-making
,
or
only
exist
for
a
short
period
of
time
(
e.g.
,
student
work
groups
;
pub
quiz/trivia
teams
)
often
undergo
a
diffusion
of
responsibility
,
where
leadership
tasks
and
roles
are
shared
amongst
members
(
Schmid
Mast
,
0000
;
Berdahl
&
Anderson
,
0000
;
Guastello
,
0000
)
.

Group
members
resist
leaders
Although
research
has
indicated
that
group
members
’
dependence
on
group
leaders
can
lead
to
reduced
self-reliance
and
overall
group
strength
,
most
people
actually
prefer
to
be
led
than
to
be
without
a
leader
(
Berkowitz
,
0000
)
.

This
"
need
for
a
leader
"
becomes
especially
strong
in
troubled
groups
that
are
experiencing
some
sort
of
conflict
.

Group
members
tend
to
be
more
contented
and
productive
when
they
have
a
leader
to
guide
them
.

Although
individuals
filling
leadership
roles
can
be
a
direct
source
of
resentment
for
followers
,
most
people
appreciate
the
contributions
that
leaders
make
to
their
groups
and
consequently
welcome
the
guidance
of
a
leader
(
Stewart
&
Manz
,
0000
)
.

Action-oriented
environments
One
approach
to
team
leadership
examines
action-oriented
environments
,
where
effective
functional
leadership
is
required
to
achieve
critical
or
reactive
tasks
by
small
teams
deployed
into
the
field
.

In
other
words
,
there
is
leadership
of
small
groups
often
created
to
respond
to
a
situation
or
critical
incident
.

In
most
cases
these
teams
are
tasked
to
operate
in
remote
and
changeable
environments
with
limited
support
or
backup
(
action
environments
)
.

Leadership
of
people
in
these
environments
requires
a
different
set
of
skills
to
that
of
front
line
management
.

These
leaders
must
effectively
operate
remotely
and
negotiate
the
needs
of
the
individual
,
team
,
and
task
within
a
changeable
environment
.

This
has
been
termed
action
oriented
leadership
.

Some
examples
of
demonstrations
of
action
oriented
leadership
include
extinguishing
a
rural
fire
,
locating
a
missing
person
,
leading
a
team
on
an
outdoor
expedition
,
or
rescuing
a
person
from
a
potentially
hazardous
environment
.

Titles
emphasizing
authority
At
certain
stages
in
their
development
,
the
hierarchies
of
social
ranks
implied
different
degrees
or
ranks
of
leadership
in
society
.

Thus
a
knight
led
fewer
men
in
general
than
did
a
duke
;
a
baronet
might
in
theory
control
less
land
than
an
earl
.

See
peerage
for
a
systematization
of
this
hierarchy
,
and
order
of
precedence
for
links
to
various
systems
.

In
the
course
of
the
00th
to
00th
centuries
,
several
political
operators
took
non-traditional
paths
to
become
dominant
in
their
societies
.

They
or
their
systems
often
expressed
a
belief
in
strong
individual
leadership
,
but
existing
titles
and
labels
(
"
King
"
,
"
Emperor
"
,
"
President
"
,
and
so
on
)
often
seemed
inappropriate
,
insufficient
,
or
downright
inaccurate
in
some
circumstances
.

The
formal
or
informal
titles
or
descriptions
they
or
their
subordinates
employ
express
and
foster
a
general
veneration
for
leadership
of
the
inspired
and
autocratic
variety
.

The
definite
article
when
used
as
part
of
the
title
(
in
languages
that
use
definite
articles
)
emphasizes
the
existence
of
a
sole
"
true
"
leader
.

Critical
thought
Noam
Chomsky
and
others
have
brought
critical
thinking
to
the
very
concept
of
leadership
and
have
provided
an
analysis
that
asserts
that
people
abrogate
their
responsibility
to
think
and
will
actions
for
themselves
.

While
the
conventional
view
of
leadership
is
rather
satisfying
to
people
who
"
want
to
be
told
what
to
do
"
,
these
critics
say
that
one
should
question
why
they
are
being
subjected
to
a
will
or
intellect
other
than
their
own
if
the
leader
is
not
a
Subject
Matter
Expert
(
SME
)
.

The
fundamentally
anti-democratic
nature
of
the
leadership
principle
is
challenged
by
the
introduction
of
concepts
such
as
autogestion
,
employeeship
,
common
civic
virtue
,
etc.
,
which
stress
individual
responsibility
and/or
group
authority
in
the
work
place
and
elsewhere
by
focusing
on
the
skills
and
attitudes
that
a
person
needs
in
general
rather
than
separating
out
leadership
as
the
basis
of
a
special
class
of
individuals
.

Similarly
,
various
historical
calamities
are
attributed
to
a
misplaced
reliance
on
the
principle
of
leadership
.

Varieties
of
individual
power
According
to
Patrick
J.
Montana
and
Bruce
H.
Charnov
,
the
ability
to
attain
these
unique
powers
is
what
enables
leadership
to
influence
subordinates
and
peers
by
controlling
organizational
resources
.

The
successful
leader
effectively
uses
these
powers
to
influence
employees
,
and
it
is
important
for
leaders
to
understand
the
uses
of
power
to
strengthen
their
leadership
.

The
authors
distinguish

of
organizational
power

Kramnik
won
games

and
0
by

"
anti-computer
tactics
—
play

advantage
the

tree
search
.

After
a
draw
in
game
0
,
Kramnik
lost
game
0
due
to
a
blunder
.

Game
0
was
described
by
commentators
as
"
spectacular
"
.

Kramnik
,
in
a
better
position
in
the
early
middlegame
,
sacrificed
a
piece
to
launch
an
attack
—
a
strategy
known
to
be
highly
risky
against
computers
,
which
are
at
their
strongest
when
defending
such
attacks
.

True
to
form
,
Fritz
found
a
watertight
defense
and
Kramnik
was
left
in
a
bad
position
.

Kramnik
resigned
the
game
,
believing
his
position
to
be
lost
.

However
,
post-game
analysis
has
shown
that
Fritz
was
unlikely
to
have
been
able
to
force
a
win
—
Kramnik
gave
up
a
drawn
position
.

The
final
two
games
were
draws
.

Given
the
circumstances
,
most
commentators
rate
Kramnik
the
stronger
player
in
the
match
.

Selection
of
Fritz
and
creation
of
Deep
Fritz
Fritz
had
been
chosen
to
play
Kramnik
by
winning
a
qualifying
event
in
Cadaques
,
Spain
in
0000
.

The
other
competing
program
was
Junior
;
the
reigning
world
computer
chess
champion
Shredder
declined
an
invitation
to
compete
.

The
00-game
match
started
very
poorly
for
Fritz
,
which
lost
five
games
in
a
row
before
coming
back
strongly
in
the
last
ten
games
to
tie
the
series
and
finally
win
the
play-off
.

Fritz
became
Deep
Fritz
when
its
hardware
was
extended
to
an
eight-processor
machine
for
the
competition
.

Advantages
Kramnik
was
given
several
advantages
in
his
match
against
Fritz
when
compared
to
most
other
Man
vs.
Machine
matches
,
such
as
the
one
Garry
Kasparov
lost
against
Deep
Blue
in
0000
.

The
code
of
Fritz
was
frozen
some
time
before
the
first
match
and
Kramnik
was
given
a
copy
of
Fritz
to
practice
with
for
several
months
.

Another
difference
was
that
in
games
lasting
more
than
00
moves
,
Kramnik
was
allowed
to
adjourn
until
the
following
day
,
during
which
time
he
could
use
his
copy
of
Fritz
to
aid
him
in
his
overnight
analysis
of
the
position
.

Fairview
is
a
city
in
Multnomah
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
population
was
0,000
.

Fairview
is
served
By
two
Trimet
Bus
Lines
00-Sandy
Blvd/000th
And

.

History
Members
of
the
Multnomah
tribe
of
Chinookan
Indians
lived
in
a
village
near
the
Columbia
River
and
the
future
site
of
Fairview
when
the
Lewis
and
Clark
Expedition
visited
the
area
in
0000
.

By
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
white
settlers
began
hay
,
grain
,
and
livestock
operations
in
what
became
eastern
Multnomah
County
.

Railroad
tracks
extended
to
the
area
by
the
0000s
,
and
,
as
the
population
grew
,
residents
began
referring
to
the
locale
as
Fairview
because
of
the
pleasing
views
of
the
nearby
river
,
the
Columbia
River
Gorge
,
and
Mount
Hood
.

Since
another
community
named
Fairview
already
existed
on
the
Oregon
Coast
,
the
community
's
first
post
office
was
named
Cleone
until
the
coastal
post
office
closed
and
the
name
was
transferred
to
Fairview
.

In
the
mid-0000s
the
city
attempted
to
merge-in
a
large
section
of
unincorporated
territory
in
eastern
Multnomah
County
.

The
plan
would
have
created
a
city
of
about
000,000
residents
,
which
at
the
time
would
have
ranked
as
the
second
most
populous
city
in
Oregon
,
behind
only
Portland
.

In
September
0000
,
the
Oregon
Supreme
Court
ruled
the
attempt
was
invalid
as
state
law
required
two
cities
to
start
any
attempt
at
consolidation
,
and
only
Fairview
had
initiated
this
attempt
.

General
,
Walter
Quinton
Gresham

code

offered
to
name

after
Postmaster
General
Walter
Q.
Gresham
if
a
post
office
was
granted
.

Until
that
time
,
the

had
simply
been

compose
themselves
before
moving

Portland
and
the
Willamette
Valley

office
was
established
in
May

,
Gresham
was
not
incorporated

Maywood
Park
is
a
city
in
Multnomah
County
,
Oregon
.

The
name
came
from
a
comment
made
by
the
wife
of
the
man
who
developed
the
original
subdivision
,
E.F.
Taylor
,
who
remarked
one
winter
night
how
attractive
the
woods
were
in
May
.

An
enclave
within
the
city
of
Portland
,
the
residents
of
the
city
voted
to
incorporate
in
0000
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
stop
the
construction
of
Interstate
000
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
In
0000
,
the
city
of
Portland
expanded
Sandy
Blvd
through
NE
Portland
to
become
a
four
lane
highway
,
linking
Portland
with
all
points
east
.

This
expansion
allowed
much
more
development
to
take
place
in
the
Parkrose
district
,
which
at
the
time
was
primarily
farmland
.

Beneath
the
eastern
shadow
of
Rocky
Butte
,
there
existed
a
relatively
untouched
section
of
land
that
was
a
thick
semi-old
growth
conifer
forest
.

A
triangular
plot
was
purchased
soon
after
by
the
Columbia
Realty
Company
.

Soon
thereafter
,
the
Maywood
Park
subdivision
was
plotted
.

In
0000
,
Columbia
Realty
was
bought
out
by
Commonwealth
,
Inc.
Under
the
direction
of
Robert
H.
Strong
,
Commonwealth
took
control
of
Maywood
Park
.

The
intention
of
the
new
developer
was
to
build
a
neighborhood
that
would
be
of
the
same
class
as
the
Laurelhurst
and
Eastmoreland
neighborhoods
in
southeast
Portland
.

During
the
Great
Depression
,
Maywood
Park
grew
slowly
throughout
the
0000s
.

By
the
end
of
the
decade
though
,
home
sales
began
to
take
off
and
in
March
0000
there
were
00
new
homes
under
construction
totaling
a
value
of
about
$
000,000
,
quite
a
large
sum
at
the
time
.

People
were
drawn
to
the
neighborhood
because
it
was
far
from
the
city
center
,
but
was
easily
accessible
by
automobile
using
Sandy
Blvd.
.

Another
large
draw
was
that
,
unlike
the
immediate
surrounding
area
,
Maywood
Park
was
completely
shrouded
by
huge
conifer
trees
.

During
World
War
II
,
the
Federal
Government
constructed
war
worker
housing
in
the
surrounding
area
,
known
as
Parkrose
.

This
development
was
far
different
from
the
homes
in
Maywood
Park
with
their
mixed
and
sometimes
eclectic
styles
of
architecture
,
beautiful
landscapes
and
tree
shaded
surroundings
.

Highway
development
After
the
passing
of
the
Federal
Aid
Highway
Act
of
0000
and
the
subsequent
construction
of
Interstate
0
through
central
Portland
,
it
became
apparent
that
the
I-0
bypass
of
I-000
was
to
be
routed
through
Maywood
Park
.

Buoyed
by
a
highway
commission
statement
which
stated
that
no
highway
should
be
pushed
through
an
incorporated
city
without
the
city
’s
approval
,
the
citizens
voted
to
incorporate
in
0000
.

The
new
city
,
now
armed
with
more
rights
than
would
be
afforded
to
a
neighborhood
,
set
out
to
dismantle
the
growing
effort
of
the
Oregon
State
Highway
Commission
to
route
I-000
through
the
city
.

In
0000
,
the
city
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
highway
commission
seeking
a
halt
to
the
continued
design
and
engineering
of
I-000
within
the
incorporated
area
.

The
lawsuit
also
stated
that
the
cost
of
constructing
I-000
through
Maywood
Park
was
wasteful
and
not
in
the
public
interest
.

In
addition
,
the
city
claimed
that
the
buying
of
rights-of-way
,
road
closures
and
changing
of
road
grades
without
consent
of
the
city
were
against
Oregon
law
.

The
city
lost
this
case
and
the
highway
commissions
plans
continued
.

In
0000
,
Maywood
Park
again
attempted
to
halt
the
freeway
construction
.

This
time
,
a
suit
was
filed
in
Federal
Court
.

The
suit
charged
that
the
highway
commission
had
refused
to
hold
any
public
hearings
and
that
construction
of
the
freeway
on
the
proposed
route
would
require
cutting
many
trees
and
stripping
the
land
,
which
would
cause
a
great
interference
with
the
wildlife
of
the
area
,
and
,
in
addition
would
created
excessive
noise
and
air
pollution
which
would
not
be
necessary
if
the
freeway
took
another
route
.

Once
again
,
Maywood
Park
lost
the
suit
.

Now
,
beaten
,
the
citizens
of
Maywood
Park
could
do
nothing
as
freeway
construction
began
to
tear
apart
their
neighborhood
.

However
a
few
concessions
were
made
as
a
result
of
public
hearings
.

Maywood
Park
insisted
that
the
freeway
and
access
roads
be
sunken
below
grade
to
lessen
the
impact
of
vehicle
sound
.

The
freeway
was
sunk
a
great
deal
from
its
original
planned
grade
.

The
city
also
demanded
a
large
wall
called
a
sound
berm
to
be
installed
on
the
border
of
the
freeway
,
which
the
state
agreed
to
.

And
finally
,
the
residents
pleaded
that
“
Every
tree
that
can
possibly
be
saved
must
be
saved
.

”
And
so
,
in
came
the
construction
crews
.

The
lower
grade
of
the
freeway
has
been
the
most
successful
sound
limiting
factor
.

The
city
battled
the
Oregon
Highway
Department
again
in
0000
when
a
lawsuit
was
filed
claiming
that
freeway
construction
had
damaged
properties
along
the
western
street
of
Maywood
Place
.

Another
concern
addressed
was
the
change
in
plans
for
the
freeway
from
0
lanes
to
00
which
was
thought
to
be
a
greater
impact
on
the
city
.

Once
again
,
the
city
lost
the
lawsuit
and
failed
to
bar
construction
.

Today
,
Maywood
Park
maintains
a
distinctive
feel
relative
to
the
surrounding
Parkrose
district
,
in
part
because
there
are
twice
as
many
East-West
streets
as
the
rest
of
the
Parkrose
area
.

Troutdale
is
a
city
in
Multnomah
County
,
Oregon
,
north
of
Gresham
and
east
of
Wood
Village
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
population
was
00,000
.

Troutdale
was
incorporated
on
October
0
,
0000
.

It
was
named
after
the
country
home
of
Captain
John
Harlow
,
a
former
sea
captain
from
Maine
,
and
a
successful
Portland
businessman
.

According
to
an
article
in
the
Oregonian
in
0000
,
he
named
his
home
Troutdale
because
it
had
a
"
small
dale
near
his
house
where
it
had
a
fish
pond
which
he
stocked
with
trout
.

The
city
serves
as
the
western
gateway
to
the
Historic
Columbia
River
Highway
,
the
Mount
Hood
Scenic
Byway
,
and
the
Columbia
River
Gorge
.

History
The
area
was
first
discovered
by
Lt.
Broughton
under
the
command
of
Captain
George
Vancouver
in
0000
.

They
had
named
Broughton
's
Bluff
which
is
an
outcropping
directly
across
the
Sandy
River
from
what
is
now
downtown
Troutdale
.

The
earliest
settlers
came
to
Troutdale
in
0000
.

David
F.
Buxton
is
considered
to
be
Troutdale
's
true
founder
.

He
had
made
land
claims
and
donated
his
land
in
0000
in
what
is
now
the
center
of
Troutdale
.

Captain
John
Harlow
purchased
part
of
Buxton
's
land
in
0000
and
built
a
home
and
some
trout
farms
,
he
named
this
farm
"
Troutdale
"
.

By
0000
a
rail
line
had
been
built
through
the
town
.

After
Harlow
's
death
in
0000
,
his
widow
Celestia
began
platting
a
town
with
blocks
and
streets
.

Transportation
TriMet
route
[

runs
through

with
several
stops
on

Due
to
the
steep
cliff
of
the

Gorge
on
NE
000th
,
connection
to
the

,
all

Because
the

The
city
of
Dallas
is
the
county
seat
of
Polk
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
population
was

at
the

Dallas
is
located
on
Rickreall
Creek
,
approximately
00
miles
west
of
Salem
,
at
an
altitude
of
000
feet
above
sea
level
.

It
is
part
of
the
Salem
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Dallas
was
settled
in
the
0000s
on
the
north
side
of
Rickreall
Creek
and
was
originally
named
"
Cynthian
"
or
"
Cynthiana
"
.

A
0000
Itemizer-Observer
article
(
quoted
in
000
Years
in
Polk
County
:
A
Centennial
Background
)
states
:
"
[
T
]
he
town
was
called
Cynthiana
after
Cynthiana
,
Ky.
,
so
named
by
Mrs.
Thos
.

The
History
of
Polk
County
Oregon
,
0000
,
Page

,
states
:
"
To
Mrs.
Thomas
J.
Lovelady
was
given
the
honor
of
naming
the
new
settlement
and
she
selected
the
name
after
her
home
town
of
Cynthiana
,
Kentucky
.
"

Another
source
claims
that
the
origin
of
the
name
may
come
from
the
name
of
Jesse
Applegate
's
wife
,
Cynthia
Ann
.

However
,
she
lived
in
the
Salt
Creek
area
of
northern
Polk
County
and
,
according
to
the
0000
Federal
Census
,
had
already
left
Polk
County
by
0000
.

Dallas
post
office
was
established
in
0000
.

In
0000
the
town
was
moved
more
than
a
mile
south
because
of
an
inadequate
supply
of
water
.

Dallas
was
in
competition
with
Independence
to
be
the
county
seat
and
the
citizens
of
Dallas
raised
$
00,000
in
order
to
have
a
branch
of
the
narrow
gauge
railroad
come
to
their
town
,
thus
securing
the
honor
.

The
line
was
built
from
0000
–
00
.

A
more
suitable
name
for
a
county
seat
was
needed
,
and
since
George
Mifflin
Dallas
was
vice-president
under
James
K.
Polk
,
for
whom
the
county
was
named
,
"
Dallas
"
was
a
natural
choice
.

Dallas
was
incorporated
as
a
town
in
0000
,
and
as
a
city
in
0000
.

Gerlinger

,
Sr.
,
incorporated
the
Salem

Company
late
in
October

and
announced
plans
to
build
a
railroad
from

at
Salem
to
the
mouth
of
the
Siletz
River
on
the
Oregon
Coast
,
a

,
Louis
's
son
George
T.
Gerlinger
organized
a

to
build
railroad
lines
in
the
area
.

On

,
0000
,
the

Willamette
Industries
was
founded
in

At
that

Monmouth
(
is
a
city
in
Polk
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
was
named
for
Monmouth
,
Illinois
,
the
origin
of
its
earliest
settlers
.

The
population
has
reached
0,000
as
of
the
0000
census
,
It
is
part
of
the
Salem
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Monmouth
was
settled
in
0000
by
a
group
of
pioneers
who
made
a
point
of
allocating
to
build
both
a
city
and
a
"
college
under
the
auspices
of
the
Christian
Church
"
and
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
these
lands
were
used
to
found
Monmouth
University
.

By
the
early
0000s
the
college
fell
on
hard
times
.

In
0000
,
ownership
was
transferred
to
the
State
of
Oregon
and
it
was
renamed
Oregon
State
Normal
School
at
Monmouth
,
and
later
the
Oregon
College
of
Education
.

It
is
now
known
as
Western
Oregon
University
.

For
decades
,
Monmouth
was
a
dry
town
that
banned
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
supermarkets
,
restaurants
and
bars
.

Monmouth
's
status
as
the
last
dry
town
in
Oregon
was
ended
by
a
popular
vote
in
the
November
0000
election
.

Spurred
on
by
the
closure
of
Monmouth
's
last
grocery
store
,
and
a
general
decline
of
its
retail
sector
,
three
local
men
(
John
Oberst
,
Paul
Sieber
,
and
Chuck
Sheffield
)
led
a
referendum
campaign
to
allow
the
sale
of
beer
and
wine
.

The
measure
passed
00-00
%
.

In
the
May
election
of
0000
,
resident
Cecelia
Koontz
placed
a
second
referendum
on
the
ballot
calling
for
the
repeal
of
the
last
vestiges
of
prohibition
.

That
measure
passed
by
a
nearly
identical
margin
,
and
Monmouth
now
allows
the
sale
of
hard
liquor
in
addition
to
beer
and
wine
.

Subsequently
,
John
Oberst
was
elected
Mayor
in
0000
,
and
Cecelia
Koontz
became
a
City
Councilor
in
0000
.

History
of
prohibition
in
Monmouth
Monmouth
,
Oregon
was
settled
by
Elijah
Davidson
and
his
Family
.

Originally
a
member
of
the
Christian
Church
of
Cameron
(
Monmouth
,
Illinois
)
,
Davidson
was
a
devout
advocate
of
prohibition
.

In
0000
,
sixty-three-year-old
Elijah
Davidson
and
his
family
set
out
for
Oregon
Territory
By
0000
,
more
than
a
dozen
Disciples
families
from
Monmouth
,
many
of
them
related
to
each
other
or
to
Davidson
,
had
joined
him
.

In
February
0000
,
Davidson
and
other
trustees
efforts
to
prohibit
the
importation
,
exportation
,
sale
,
and
consumption
of
alcohol
in
Monmouth
became
a
reality
.

One
of
the
main
arguments
Davidson
and
his
fellow
religious
supporters
used
to
push
prohibition
legislation
was
,
"
to
enable
them
to
suppress
and
prevent
nuisances
,
to
render
the
possession
of
life
and
property
more
secure
,
[
and
]
to
enable
them
to
improve
and
embellish
the
streets
of
the
town
.
"

Despite
the
efforts
of
certain
merchants
to
repeal
prohibition
in
Monmouth
throughout
its
history
,
their
efforts
proved
useless
.

What
was
most
important
to
the
local
religious
community
was
to
keep
prohibition
for
the
betterment
of
the
social
order
of
Monmouth
.

Although
opponents
raised
religious
,
moral
,
economic
,
and
quality-of-life
arguments
similar
to
those
preached
during
the
nineteenth
century
,
they
also
brought
two
new
arguments
to
center
stage
:
the
historic
nature
of
Monmouth
's
prohibition
and
the
uniqueness
that
local
prohibition
brought
to
the
town
.

Opponents
of
prohibition
pointed
out
that
while
it
was
historic
,
it
was
also
detrimental
to
the
normal
development
of
the
city
,
and
that
no
visitor
ever
came
to
town
to
look
at
the
dry
law
.

Eventually
support
for
the
prohibition
ordinance
started
to
wear
thin
throughout
the
community
of
Monmouth
.

Although
die-hard
supporters
of
prohibition
continued
to
fight
the
inevitable
,
there
were
signs
that
it
was
starting
to
become
more
and
more
detrimental
to
the
social
and
economic
aspects
of
the
community
.

Some
claim
that
prohibition
had
reduced
property
values
,
others
that
it
restricted
development
of
the
business
sector
in
town
.

Opponents
of
repeal
brought
forth
many
arguments
for
staying
dry
,
including
initiating
one
rumor
that
the
land
donated
so
long
ago
for
the
site
of
the
University
would
revert
to
the
heirs
of
the
donors
if
the
ordinance
was
repealed
,
resulting
in
a
huge
cost
to
the
state
to
repurchase
it
.

The
loss
of
the
last
grocery
store
in
Monmouth
in
0000
was
the
event
that
tipped
the
argument
once
and
for
all
.

Beer
and
wine
sales
began
in
January
0000
.

In
the
subsequent
decade
,
at
least
0
new
alcohol
serving
restaurants
,
a
wine
bar
and
0
convenience
stores
opened
in
the
city
,
suggesting
that
the
proponents
of
repeal
were
correct
in
identifying
prohibition
as
a
drag
on
the
local
economy
.

Despite
the
fears
raised
by
proponents
of
prohibition
,
the
alcohol-related
crime
rate
,
and
crime
rate
in
general
have
remained
flat
since
repeal
.

After
failing
by
a
nearly
0
to
0
margin
in
the
early
0000s
,
repeal
was
passed
by
the
voters
in
November
0000
,
and
Monmouth
ended
its
long
tenure
as
the
last
dry
town
on
the
west
coast
.

History
In
0000
,
Mr.
Johnson
,
a
cook
on
an
English
ship
sailing
along
the
Columbia
River
,
deserted
and
traveled
down
the
Willamette
Valley
.

Establishing
a
land
claim
in
Champoeg
,
he
began
removing
brush
and
that
summer
set
off
a
burn
to
clear
debris
.

The
Champoeg
Fire
got
out
of
control
and
spread
eastward
.

Unfortunately
,
the
wind
then
reversed
direction
and
strengthened
,
blowing
the
blaze
around
the
previous
burn
and
fanning
it
into
the
dry
Coast
Range
,
where
it
burned
in
the
Yamhill
basin
for
weeks
,
consuming
of
old
growth
forest
-
the
largest
such
area
destroyed
in
a
single
forest
fire
in
the
United
States
.

Settlers
did
not
live
west
of
the
Coast
Range
,
but
the
small
tribes
of
Native
Americans
in
the
area
,
already
depleted
by
00
%
due
to
malaria
and
other
epidemics
from
0000
–
0000
,
were
driven
from
their
lands
.

The
Nestuggas
were
one
such
tribe
,
that
had
previously
been
encamped
just
north
of
Pacific
City
near
the
town
of
Woods
.

They
had
noticed
the
smoke
for
several
weeks
,
but
were
surprised
one
morning
as
the
bright
flames
flickered
atop
the
crests
of
the
surrounding
hills
and
rushed
down
on
them
.

The
Nestuggas
fled
by
canoe
down
the
Big
Nestucca
River
to
the
ocean
,
and
took
refuge
on
the
half-mile
wide
bare
sandspit
between
Nestucca
Bay
and
the
ocean
.

After
several
weeks
the
fires
were
ended
by
a
heavy
rain
,
but
the
devastation
had
been
complete
:
The
forests
were
gone
,
and
the
game
found
to
be
charred
crisp
or
cooked
in
the
water
they
had
sought
refuge
in
.

Nestucca
Bay
was
a
rich
fishing
area
,
allowing
the
Nestuggas
to
survive
despite
the
destruction
of
game
.

However
,
beginning
in
0000
settlers
began
arriving
in
the
Tillamook
Valley
,
and
by
0000
Chief
Nestugga
Bill
and
the
000
remaining
people
of
the
small
tribe
were
relocated
to
a
reservation
on
the
Salmon
and
Siletz
River
.

Many
early
pioneers
arrived
via
seagoing
steamers
,
others
arrived
from
across
the
mountains
.

The
town
of
Woods
established
itself
as
a
depot
for
the
new
arrivals
and
a
source
of
supplies
and
trade
for
the
settlers
.

In
0000
the
Linewebber
and
Brown
cannery
was
started
to
take
advantage
of
the
plentiful
fish
in
Nestucca
Bay
,
shipping
00,000
cans
of
salmon
a
year
and
providing
an
economic
basis
until
0000
for
the
region
,
along
with
logging
and
dairy
farming
.

The
area
also
became
a
"
vacation
"
destination
for
Oregon
Trail
pioneers
from
the
midwest
,
who
had
never
seen
the
ocean
.

In
0000
,
Thomas
Malaney
platted
the
town
of
Ocean
Park
(
now
Pacific
City
)
directly
across
the
river
from
Woods
.

When
a
flood
in
0000
wiped
out
the
first
lots
,
Malaney
moved
the
town
south
to
higher
ground
.

The
Sea
View
hotel
(
later
renamed
Edmundes
Hotel
)
was
built
around
0000
to
serve
vacationers
from
the
Willamette
Valley
.

Other
buildings
and
campgrounds
were
established
for
visitors
,
and
Ferry
Street
was
"
paved
"
with
wooden
planks
for
automobiles
.

The
town
gained
its
modern
name
of
Pacific
City
in
0000
to
avoid
confusion
with
the
Washington
town
of
Ocean
Park
.

By
0000
,
overfishing
from
gillnetting
had
left
the
bay
depleted
of
salmon
,
so
commercial
harvesting
was
stopped
and
fishermen
switched
to
surf-launched
dories
;
over
time
due
to
commercial
fishing
vessels
,
the
Dory
Fleet
dwindled
and
today
only
a
few
recreational
fishermen
keep
the
tradition
alive
.

Tourism
in
the
0000s
became
the
mainstay
of
the
economy
,
lasting
until
the
depression
of
the
0000s
.

An
airport
was
built
to
attract
barnstormers
and
aviators
,
and
other
roads
and
bridges
were
opened
.

,
and
the
Oregon
Railroad
and
Navigation
Company
built
a
railroad
through
the
Echo
by
0000
,
which
made
the
town
a
shipping
point
for
wool
,
cattle
and
sheep
during
the
early
0000s
.

Echo
was
incorporated
in

Milton-Freewater
is
a
city
in
Umatilla
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
city
received
its
current
name
in
0000
when
the
neighboring
rival
cities
of
Milton
and
Freewater
voted
to
merge
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Pendleton
–
Hermiston
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Originally
called
Freeport
,
when
the
construction
of
a
mill
was
proposed
about
0000
,
the
community
changed
its
name
to
Milltown
,
which
became
Milton
by
0000
.

Freewater
,
although
named
New
Walla
Walla
on
its
original
plat
filed
in
0000
,
received
its
name
from
the
offer
of
free
water
extended
to
new
settlers
.

This
town
was
located
to
the
north
of
Milton
.

In
the
0000s
,
Milton-Freewater
billed
itself
as
the
pea
capital
of
the
world
.

They
had
a
yearly
festival
and
parade
known
as
the
"
Pea
Festival
"
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
agriculture
practices
and
crop
prices
changed
the
dynamics
of
the
local
economy
and
peas
were
no
longer
grown
as
abundantly
as
they
once
were
.

The
town
dropped
the
title
and
the
celebration
.

At
the
time
,
Milton-Freewater
had
a
popular
festival
called
the
"
Corn
Roast
"
(
started
by
local
resident
Thomas
Dodd
when
he
was
Chamber
President
in
the
early
0000s
)
that
took
place
in
August
,
and
the
decision
was
made
to
increase
the
festival
to
a
weekend
long
celebration
which
eventually
became
known
as
"
Muddy
Frogwater
Days
"
.

The
city
had
long
been
referred
to
as
"
Muddy-Frogwater
"
by
the
locals
,
so
some
enterprising
individuals
decided
to
capitalize
on
that
theme
and
hence
Muddy
Frogwater
Days
were
born
.

Muddy
Frogwater
is
now
an
annual
festival
that
runs
in
August
.

The
festival
brings
in
all
visitors
from
even
Walla
Walla
,
Weston
,
Athena
and
even
Pendleton
.

The
festival
is
a
good
way
for
business
promotion
as
many
booths
and
vendors
are
local
companies
in
the
area
.

Some
activities
in
the
past
have
included
concerts
,
karaoke
,
a
train
ride
for
small
children
,
roasted
corn
feed
,
and
a
dance
in
the
evening
.

On
the
Sunday
morning
of
the
festival
there
is
a
church
service
.

Since
then
the
town
has
been
firmly
committed
to
marketing
itself
to
business
and
tourism
as
a
"
fun
town
"
able
to
laugh
at
itself
and
the
quirky
nickname
.

Unfortunately
,
since
it
is
indeed
a
small
town
with
limited
infrastructure
,
the
city
has
lost
most
of
its
business
to
Walla
Walla
,
Washington
just
to
the
north
.

Originally
named
Foster
,
Stanfield
is
named
after
Sen.
Robert
N.
Stanfield
who
purchased
the
area
in
0000
from
C.B.
Wade
of
Pendleton
for
use
as
the
headquarters
of
his
extensive
sheep
and
wool
enterprises
.

Because
of
its
proximity
to
the
railroad
,
the
site
was
used
for
shearing
wool
,
holding
sheep
for
shipping
,
and
storing
supplies
for
the
operations
in
warehouses
.

(
At
one
time
,
Sen.
Stanfield
and
his
brothers
operated
the
largest
sheep
ranching
operations
in
North
America
.
)

,
With
the
development
of
the
Furnish
Ditch
irrigation
system
serving
the
lands
around
Stanfield
,
Sen.
Stanfield
joined
with
Dr.
Henry
Waldo
Coe
of
Portland
in
0000
to
subdivide
the
area
and
create
the
town
of
Stanfield
.

Sen.
Stanfield
got
half
of
the
lots
created
by
the
subdivision
and
Dr.
Coe
's
development
company
got
the
other
half.
,
Dr.
Coe
began
operating
excursion
trains
to
bring
interested
buyers
to
Stanfield
to
see
the
lots
that
were
being
offered
for
sale
.

The
two
story
Stanfield
ranch
house
was
turned
into
a
hotel
to
house
the
visitors
.

A
bank
building
was
built
with
an
office
in
the
back
for
Sen.
Stanfield
.

A
door
allowed
the
Senator
to
come
and
go
without
going

lobby
.

The
old
bank
building
is
now
the

Weston
is
a
city
in
Umatilla
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
was
originally
a
post
office
called
Mitchell
's
Station
,
established
in
February
0000
.

In
September
0000
,
T.T.
Lieuallen
renamed
the
post
office
after
his
hometown
,
Weston
,
Missouri
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Pendleton
–
Hermiston
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Weston
was
incorporated
by
the
Oregon
Legislative
Assembly
on
October
00
,
0000
.

Weston
is
best
known
for
its
connection
with
novelist
Nard
Jones
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
who
lived
in
the
city
with
his
parents
between
0000
and
0000
,
and
whose
first
novel
Oregon
Detour
was
set
in
an
Oregon
town
of
000
inhabitants
called
"
Creston
"
.

When
his
novel
,
written
according
to
the
tenets
of
the
New
Realism
literary
movement
(
established
years
before
by
Sherwood
Anderson
,
Sinclair
Lewis
and
others
)
was
published
in
0000
,
many
of
the
residents
were
convinced
that
his
characters
were
based
on
local
inhabitants
,
and
considered
the
work
a
slander
against
the
town
.

While
the
legend
that
Jones
was
sued
and
ran
out
of
town
for
his
book
is
not
true
,
members
of
the
town
made
an
effort
to
locally
suppress
access
to
the
book
:
copies
of
the
novel
were
stolen
from
the
local
library
;
after
the
novel
became
the
subject
for
a
high
school
student
's
book
report
,
his
English
teacher
removed
the
book
from
both
the
reading
list
and
the
high
school
library
.

According
to
George
Venn
,
local
literary
historian
,
even
in
the
0000s
,
"
trying
to
figure
out
or
trying
to
remember
who
the
'
real
people
'
in
the
novel
is
still
a
local
pastime
.

La
Grande
(
)
is
a
city
in
Union
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

Originally
named
"
Brownsville
,
"
it
was
forced
to
change
its
name
due
to
that
name
already
being
used
for
a
city
in
Linn
County
.

Its
current
name
comes
from
an
early
French
settler
,
Charles
Dause
,
who
often
used
the
phrase
"
La
Grande
"
to
describe
the
area
's
beauty
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Union
County
.

La
Grande
lies
east
of
the
Blue
Mountains
and
southeast
of
Pendleton
.

History
Early
settlement
The
Grande
Ronde
Valley
had
long
been
a
waypoint
along
the
Oregon
Trail
.

The
first
permanent
settler
in
the
La
Grande
area
was
Benjamin
Brown
in
0000
.

Not
long
after
,
the
Leasey
family
and
about
twenty
others
settled
there
.

The
settlement
was
originally
named
after
Ben
Brown
as
Brown
's
Fort
,
Brown
's
Town
,
or
Brownsville
.

There
was
already
a
Brownsville
in
Linn
County
,
so
when
the
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
a
more
distinctive
name
was
needed
.

It
was
decided
to
use
"
La
Grande
"
,
a
phrase
used
by
a
Frenchman
,
Charles
Dause
,
to
describe
the
area
's
scenic
splendor
.

Before
the
post
office
was
established
,
William
Carter
charged
00
cents
a
letter
to
carry
the
mail
on
horseback
from
the
nearest
post
office
,
in
Walla
Walla
,
Washington
.

La
Grande
was
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
,
and
plat
ted
in
0000
.

Growth
La
Grande
grew
rapidly
during
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
,
partially
because
of
the
many
gold
mines
in
the
region
and
the
valley
's
agricultural
capabilities
.

The
early
business
establishments
centered
on
C
Avenue
between
present
day
Fourth
Street
and
the
hillside
on
the
west
end
.

In
0000
,
the
railroad
came
to
the
flat
slightly
east
of
"
Old
Town
"
.

This
helped
the
town
to
grow
,
and
also
gave
rise
to
"
New
Town
"
,
centered
on
Adams
Avenue
and
built
parallel
to
the
railroad
tracks
.

By
0000
,
La
Grande
's
population
was
0000
,
representing
half
of
the
population
of
Baker
City
.

La
Grande
's
Eastern
Oregon
University
,
formerly
known
as
Eastern
Oregon
State
College
,
began
in
0000
as
Eastern
Oregon
Normal
School
,
a
teachers
college
.

Sugar
factory
La
Grande
had
a
factory
for
processing
sugar
beet
s
into
raw
sugar
.

The
sugar
beets
came
from
the
nearby
Mormon
town
of
Nibley
,
Oregon
,
and
both
were
owned
by
the
Oregon
Sugar
Company
.

R.
Doerstling
,
the
superintendent
of
the
factory
in
0000
,
reported
seeing
a
Native
American
teepee
built
out
of
used
cloth
filters
from
the
factory
.

the
Union
states
,

,
of

American
Civil
War
.

La
Grande
was
named
the
county
seat
when
Union
County
was
created
in
0000
.

Due
to
the
Thomas
and
Ruckle
Road
going
through

,
it
elected

seat
in
0000
,
but
when

put
through
La
Grande
instead

.

La
Grande
became
the

town
within
the
county
and
regained
the
county
seat
in
0000
.

J.
W.
Shelton
,
a
local
attorney
,
chartered
the
Union
Electric
Power
and
Light
Company
in
March
0000
to
bring
the
railroad
from
Union
Junction
(
0.0

itself
.

The
company
was
renamed
the
Union
Railway
Company
in
July
0000
,
and
the
rail
spur
was
built
into
Union
by
August
0000
.

Shelton
planned
to
build
more
lines
,
had
a
fight
with
his
company
partners
(
the
Hutchinsons
)
,
then
two
competing
firms
were
formed
:
Shelton
's
The
Union
Railway
in
January
0000
,
and
Hutchinsons
'
Union
Street
Railway
and
Suburban
Railway
.

Both
companies
competed
to
buy
the
Union
Railway
Company
.

Shelton
maintained
control
until
August
0000
,
when
The
Union
Railway
was
renamed
to
the
Union
,
Cove
and
Valley
Railway
.

This
company
was
bought
the
following
year
by
a
timber
company
from
the
East
Coast
.

During
the
0000
November
elections
,
Kyle
Corbin
,
an
00-year-old
college
student
,
was
elected
mayor
after
a
successful
write-in
campaign
.

He
had
promised
to
bring
an
end
to
the
political
chaos
that
had
plagued
the
town
for
the
last
two
years
,
which
included
three
councilmen
and
mayor
Deborah
Clark
being
removed
in
recall
election
s.
"
I
know
the
procedures
and
rules
,
"
he
told
an
Oregonian
reporter
.
"

I
've
run
a
meeting
with
a
bunch
of
high
school
kids
.
"

Since
then
,
one
newspaper
reports
that
"
talk
around
town
about
whether
the
young
mayor
will
succeed
ranges
from
skepticism
to
sunny
optimism
.

Antelope
is
a
city
in
Wasco
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
Census
,
the
population
was
00
.

History
The
Antelope
Valley
was
probably
named
by
members
of
Joseph
Sherar
's
party
who
were
packing
supplies
to
mines
in
the
John
Day
area
.

Sherar
became
known
as
the
operator
of
a
toll
bridge
across
the
Deschutes
River
,
on
a
cut-off
of
the
Barlow
Road
.

There
were
many
pronghorn
s
(
often
called
pronghorn
antelope
)
in
the
area
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Antelope
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
with
Howard
Maupin
,
founder
of
Maupin
,
Oregon
,
as
the
first
postmaster
.

The
town
flourished
briefly
,
but
when
Shaniko
,
a
few
miles
north
,
became
the
terminus
of
the
railroad
,
Antelope
began
to
fade
.

The
community
was
incorporated
by
the
Oregon
Legislative
Assembly
on
January
00
,
0000
.

In
the
0000s
the
town
grew
again
when
followers
of
Bhagwan
Shree
Rajneesh
,
who
had
started
the
city
of
Rajneeshpuram
on
the
nearby
"
Big
Muddy
Ranch
"
,
began
to
move
in
.

Rajneeshpuram
was
an
intentional
community
(
or
commune
)
of
Rajneeshee
s.
On
September
00
,
0000
,
Antelope
's
charter
was
amended
by
a
vote
of
00
to
00
to
change
the
name
of
the
city
to
Rajneesh
.

A
short
time
later
Rajneesh
was
indicted
on
federal
immigration
charges
,
attempted
to
leave
the
country
,
and
pleaded
no
contest
to
two
of
the
00
charges
and
returned
to
India
.

On
November
0
,
0000
,
the
remaining
residents
,
both
original
and
Rajneeshee
,
voted
00
to
0
to
restore
the
original
name
,
which
was
never
changed
by
the
Postal
Service
.

The
ranch
is
now
owned
by
Young
Life
and
has
been
converted
into
a
camp
known
as
"
Washington
Family
Ranch

The
Dalles
(
)
is
the
largest
city
and
county
seat
of
Wasco
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
name
of
the
city
comes
from
the
French
word
dalle
(
meaning
either
"
sluice
"
or
"
flagstone
"
and
referring
to
the
columnar
basalt
rocks
carved
by
the
river
,
in
voyageur
French
used
to
refer
to
rapids
)
,
which
was
used
by
the
French-Canadian
employees
of
the
North
West
Company
to
refer
to
the
rapids
of
the
Columbia
River
between
the
present-day
city
and
Celilo
Falls
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Also
in
the
same
area
was
the
Petite
Dalles
or
Little
Dalles
,
or
Short
Narrows
.

History
The
site
of
what
is
now
the
city
of
The
Dalles
was
a
major
Native
American
trading
center
for
at
least
00,000
years
.

The
general
area
is
one
of
the
continent
's
most
significant
archaeological
regions
.

Lewis
and
Clark
camped
near
Mill
Creek
on
October
00
–
00
,
0000
,
and
recorded
the
Native
American
name
for
the
creek
as
Quenett
.

The
first
use
of
the
name
Dalles
,
according
to
Oregon
Geographic
Names
,
appears
in
fur
trader
Gabriel
Franchère
's
Narrative
,
on
April
00
,
0000
,
referring
to
the
long
series
of
major
rapids
in
the
river
.

By
0000
several
overland
groups
of
the
land
components
of
the
Astor
Expedition
of
0000
–
0000
would
have
passed
by
and
explored
the
vicinity
of
the
rapids
.

In
0000
British
fur
trade
r
of
the
Montreal-based
North
West
Company
(
NWC
)
began
traveling
through
The
Dalles
area
.

In
July
0000
David
Thompson
of
the
NWC
voyaged
down
the
Columbia
River
,
reaching
the
partially
constructed
Fort
Astoria
of
the
American
rival
Pacific
Fur
Company
.

When
Thompson
's
party
returned
upriver
a
small
Astorian
party
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
rapids
at
The
Dalles
.

The
Astorian
party
went
on
to
found
Fort
Okanogan
.

The
War
of
0000
led
to
the
0000
sale
of
Fort
Astoria
and
the
entire
Pacific
Fur
Company
to
the
North
West
Company
.

In
0000
the
North
West
Company
was
absorbed
by
the
giant
London-based
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
(
HBC
)
.

Fort
Vancouver
,
built
in
0000
,
replaced
Fort
Astoria
as
the
regional
fur
trade
headquarters
.

The
HBC
's
trading
network
made
extensive
use
of
the
Columbia
River
.

The
rapids
of
the
Columbia
River
at
The
Dalles
was
the
largest
and
longest
of
the
four
"
great
portages
"
,
where
fur
trading
boats
had
to
unload
and
transship
their
cargoes
.

Sometimes
,
during
high
water
,
boats
traveling
downriver
would
"
shoot
the
rapids
"
instead
of
portaging
,
although
the
practice
was
dangerous
and
many
people
died
as
a
result
over
the
years
.

In
0000
a
branch
of
Jason
Lee
's
Methodist
mission
was
established
at
The
Dalles
.

It
was
called
"
Wascopam
"
,
after
the
native
Wasco
people
.

In
the
early
0000s
American
settlers
began
to
arrive
in
significant
numbers
,
traveling
overland
via
the
Oregon
Trail
.

The
trail
ended
at
The
Dalles
.

It
was
not
possible
to
take
wagons
farther
west
due
to
steep
cliffs
that
fell
straight
into
the
Columbia
River
.

Until
the
construction
of
the
Barlow
Road
in
0000
,
the
only
way
to
reach
Fort
Vancouver
and
the
Willamette
Valley
was
by
rafting
down
the
river
from
The
Dalles
.

In
0000
,
at
the
start
of
the
Cayuse
War
,
the
mission
buildings
at
The
Dalles
were
occupied
by
volunteer
militia
.

In
0000
the
U.S.
Army
founded
a
small
post
at
the
site
of
the
old
mission
.

In
0000
it
was
named
Fort
Drum
and
shortly
after
,
Fort
Dalles
.

The
post
became
the
nucleus
of
the
town
of
The
Dalles
,
which
began
to
develop
along
the
waterfront
.

In
0000
,
at
the
end
of
the
Cayuse
War
,
the
Native
Americans
living
near
The
Dalles
were
forceably
relocated
by
the
U.S.
Army
to
the
Warm
Springs
Indian
Reservation
.

A
post
office
was
established
within
the
boundaries
of
the
current
city
in
0000
,
and
The
Dalles
was
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
.

It
has
been
the
major
commercial
center
between
Portland
and
Pendleton
since
.

The
city
was
originally
named
just
"
Dalles
"
.

In
0000
it
was
changed
to
"
Wascopum
,
"
then
,
in
0000
,
to
"
The
Dalles
"
.

In
0000
,
the
U.S.
Congress
appropriated
money
to
build
a
U.S.
mint
in
The
Dalles
that
was
to
use
gold
from
Canyon
City
for
coinage
.

The
supply
of
gold
from
Canyon
City
began
to
dwindle
,
however
,
and
other
problems
,
such
as
cost
over-runs
,
workers
leaving
to
work
the
gold
fields
,
and
flooding
from
the
Columbia
River
,
also
contributed
to
the
project
running
two
years
behind
schedule
and
led
eventually

In
0000
,
the
State
of
Oregon
received
the
property
from
the
U.S.
Government
and
the

was
put
to

is
now
home

In
0000
,
Bobbie
the
Wonder
Dog
stopped
briefly
in
The
Dalles
while
on
his
0,000
mile
journey
home
by
foot
from
Indiana
to
Silverton
,
Oregon
.

Emaciated
and
tired
,
he
was
aided
by
members
of
the
community
before
moving
westward
through
the
Columbia
Gorge
.

Construction
of
The
Dalles
Dam
in

and
Celilo
Falls
.

In
0000
,
Ken
Kesey
's
novel
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoo
's
Nest
was
published
featuring
the
narrator
,
Chief
,
who
is
from
The
Dalles
.

In
0000
,
the
Bonneville
Power
Administration
opened
the
Celilo
Converter
Station
near
the
northern
terminus
of
the
Pacific
DC
Intertie
which
sends
0,000
megawatts
of
electricity
to
Los
Angeles
.

In
0000
a
curly-coated
kitten
was
born
on
a
farm
in
The
Dalles
owned
by
Linda
and
Dick
Koehl
.

The
Koehls
used
this
kitten
and
her
offspring
to
develop
a
new
breed
of
cat
called
the
LaPerm
,
which
went
on
to
become
a
popular
,
established
,
championship
pedigree
cat
breed
around
the
world
.

In
0000
,
Penalty
Phase
,
a
film
starring
Peter
Strauss
and
Melissa
Gilbert
,
was
filmed
in
and
around
The
Dalles
.

In
0000
,
the
Internet
company
Google
began
building
a
major
data
center
,
known
locally
as
Project
00
,
along
the
Columbia
River
in
The
Dalles
,
using
the
area
's
reliable
hydroelectric
power
and
the
underutilized
fiber
optic
capacity
of
the
area
.

The
new
complex
includes
two
buildings
,
each
approximately
the
size
of
a
football
field
,
and
two
cooling
plants
,
each
four
stories
high
.

The
project
has
created
hundreds
of
jobs
in
the
area
,
mainly
in
construction
,
with
an
additional
000
permanent
positions
expected
later
in
0000
.

Terrorism
In
0000
,
The
Dalles
was
the
scene
of
a
bioterrorist
incident
launched
by
members
of
the
Rajneesh
Movement
in
an
attempt
to
gain
control
of
the
local
government
of
Wasco
County
.

Salmonella
placed
in
ten
restaurants
resulted
in
000
cases
of
Salmonellosis
.

It
was
the
first
known
bioterrorism
attack
of
the
00th
century
in
the
United
States
.

The
circumstances
of
the
attack
are
documented
in

Geography
Highways
I-00
,
U.S.
00
,
and
U.S.
000
meet
in
the
city
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
,
is
land
and
is
water
.

Climate
The
Dalles
is
usually
classified
as
a
cool
semiarid
(
Koppen
BSk
)
climate
region
.

However
it
has
some
characteristics
of
the
midlatitude
oceanic
climate
that
dominates
west
of
the
Cascade
Mountains
,
combined
with
seasonal
precipitation
patterns
very
similar
to
those
found
in
Mediterranean
climates
.

The
city
's
location
in
the
eastern
Columbia
Gorge
results
in
there
being
numerous
microclimates
within
a
few
miles
of
town
.

The
summer
season
runs
from
mid-June
through
early
September
and
is
quite
warm
by
Pacific
Northwest
standards
;
however
,
summer
weather
often
oscillates
between
intense
heat
waves
and
much
cooler
and
windier
periods
.

Except
for
the
occasional
sporadic
thunderstorm
,
there
is
almost
no
summer
rainfall
.

From
late
September
through
early
November
,
the
area
experiences
an
abrupt
autumn
during
which
normal
temperatures
drop
very
rapidly
and
cloudy
,
wet
weather
quickly
picks
up
.

Prior
to
the
sudden
onset
of
the
rainy
season
in
mid
-
to
late
fall
,
there
are
often
days
with
a
very
wide
disparity
between
daytime
and
nighttime
temperatures
,
sometimes
exceeding
00
C
/
00
F.
There
is
far
less
wind
in
the
fall
than
in
spring
and
early
summer
,
though
passing
frontal
systems
can
still
bring
quick
bouts
of
strong
wind
.

Winter
is
the
rainy
season
in
The
Dalles
.

Despite
the
rain
shadow
effect
created
by
the
Cascades
,
there
is
still
enough
precipitation
most
years
to
support
relatively
high
soil
moisture
levels
for
most
of
the
winter
.

This
is
a
very
similar
pattern
to
what
happens
in
classic
Mediterranean
climates
-
except
that
the
temperatures
are
significantly
colder
.

The
area
receives
measured
snowfall
virtually
every
year
,
but
the
snow
totals
fluctuate
dramatically
from
one
year
to
the
next
;
some
seasons
see
only
one
or
two
brief
light
snow
events
while
others
get
major
snowstorms
and
cumulative
totals
of
00cm
(
00
in
.
)

Average
winter
temperatures
are
only
about
0
–
0
C
(
0
–
0
F
)
degrees
colder
than
in
cities
such
as
Portland
and
Seattle
,
and
temperatures
below
−
00
C
(
−
0
F
)
are
very
rare
,
but
not
unheard
of
.

As
in
the
summer
,
winter
temperatures
can
vary
tremendously
from
one
day
to
the
next
:
during
arctic
air
events
the
daytime
high
temperatures
will
generally
be
well
below
0C
/
00F
,
while
a
strong
subtropical
push
can
raise
temperatures
into
the
00s
and
low
00s
F
,
even
in
January
.

It
is
quite
common
for
relatively
cold
air
to
become
trapped
at
low
elevations
due
to
an
inversion
above
;
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
surface
airmass
,
depth
of
the
inversion
layer
,
and
temperatures
above
the
inversion
layer
,
this
can
result
in
snow
,
sleet
,
freezing
rain
or
a
very
cold
liquid
rain
.

Springtime
conditions
generally
run
from
late
February
through
early
June
,
during
which
time
the
overall
trend
gradually
becomes
warmer
and
drier
.

This
is
the
windiest
season
of
all
,
with
a
powerful
west
wind
on
most
afternoons
.

During
stormy
periods
in
spring
it
is
usually
cloudy
and
cool
while
most
sunny
and
calm
days
become
intensely
warm
,
especially
from
April
onward
.

Spring
temperatures
often
vary
more
from
one
week
to
the
next
than
they
do
from
one
month
to
the
next
.

The
growing
season
is
roughly
000
days
in
a
typical
year
,
generally
running
from
early
April
through
most
of
October
.

However
spring
frost
dates
can
range
from
mid-March
to
early
May
,
and
fall
frost
dates
from
late
September
to
mid-November
.

For

According
to
Oregon
Geographic
Names
,
the
exact
origin
of
the
name
"
Rowena
"
is
disputed
.

Two
sources
say
Rowena
was
named
for
H.S.
Rowe
,
a
railroad
company
official
,
in
the
early
0000s
.

Another
source
says
it
was
named
for
a
girl
,
Rowena
,
who
had
been
living
in
the
area
at
the
time
the
community
was
founded
.

It
is
also
possible
that
the
name
comes
indirectly
from
Rowena
,
Ivanhoe
s
lady
,
in
the
novel
by
Sir
Walter
Scott
.

There
was

Shaniko
is
a
city
located
in
Wasco
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
,
on
U.S.
Route
00
and
about
eight
miles
(
00
km
)
north
of
Antelope
.

The
population
was
00
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
first
European
American
s
came
to
the
Shaniko
area
after
the
discovery
of
gold
in
Canyon
City
,
Oregon
,
in
0000
.

The
route
to
Canyon
City
started
at
the
early
settlement
of
The
Dalles
,
away
.

Camps
were
made
wherever
water
could
be
found
.

One
camp
,
which
became
the
farming
community
of
Bakeoven
,
was
closely
associated
with
the
future
town
of
Shaniko
,
while
another
camp
,
Cross
Hollow
,
was
located
in
the
present
Shaniko
city
limits
.

In
0000
,
following
complaints
of
hostile
Indians
and
fear
of
robbery
of
those
transporting
gold
,
the
State
of
Oregon
received
a
grant
from
the
United
States
government
to
build
a
military
wagon
road
from
The
Dalles
to
Fort
Boise
,
Idaho
.

Following
this
road
,
homesteaders
began
claiming
land
in
Central
Oregon
that
was
previously
fairly
inaccessible
.

One
of
these
settlers
was
August
Scherneckau
,
who
came
to
the
area
after
the
Civil
War
,
in
0000
.

The
spelling
of
the
town
's
name
reflects
local
pronunciation
of
Scherneckau
's
name
.

The
town
was
originally
called
Cross
Hollows
,
and
a
post
office
by
that
name
was
established
in
May
0000
with
Scherneckau
as
postmaster
.

Cross
Hollows
post
office
closed
in
0000
,
and
Shaniko
post
office
opened
in
0000
.

The
town
's
heyday
was
the
first
decade
of
the
00th
century
,
when
Shaniko
served
as
a
transportation
hub
spurred
by
the
presence
of
the
Columbia
Southern
Railway
,
a
subsidiary
of
Union
Pacific
Railroad
,
which
built
a
branch
from
Biggs
Junction
to
a
terminus
in
Shaniko
.

That
branch
was
completed
in
May
0000
.

At
the
time
,
the
city
was
known
as
the
"
Wool
Capital
of
the
World
"
,
and
it
was
the
center
of
of
wool
,
wheat
,
cattle
and
sheep
production
,
with
no
other
such
center
east
of
the
Cascade
Range
in
Oregon
.

The
region
served
by
the
city
even
stretched
into
Idaho
,
south
to
Klamath
Falls
,
Oregon
and
beyond
,
because
of
rail
connections
to
the
main
line
.

The
residents
of
Shaniko
voted
to
incorporate
Shaniko
and
elected
a
mayor
,
F.
T.
Hurlbert
,
and
other
city
officials
on
January
0
,
0000
.

It
was
Wasco
County
's
fifth
largest
city
,
boasting
the
largest
wool
warehouse
in
the
state
,
from
which
two
tons
were
marketed
in
0000
.

It
was
surrounded
by
cattle
ranches
,
which
produced
livestock
for
shipment
that
filled
000
railroad
cars
that
year
.

By
0000
,
another
line
diverted
traffic
once
served
by
the
Columbia
Southern
and
the
town
begin
to
decline
.

A
mid-0000s
flood
in
Hay
Canyon
near
Grass
Valley
destroyed
part
of
the
Columbia
Southern
line
and
led
to
its
abandonment
.

Aloha
(
,
not
)
is
a
census-designated
place
and
an
unincorporated
community
in
Washington
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

By
road
it
is
west
of
downtown
Portland
.

As
of
the
0000
Census
,
the
population
was
00,000
.

History
On
January
0
,
0000
,
the
community
received
its
name
with
the
opening
of
a
post
office
named
Aloha
;
the
area
had
previously
been
known
as
Wheeler
Crossing
.

According
to
Oregon
Geographic
Names
,
the
origin
of
the
name
Aloha
is
disputed
.

Some
sources
say
it
was
named
by
Robert
Caples
,
a
railroad
worker
,
but
it
is
unknown
why
the
name
was
chosen
.

In
0000
Joseph
H.
Buck
claimed
that
his
uncle
,
the
first
postmaster
,
Julius
Buck
,
named
the
office
"
Aloah
"
after
a
small
resort
on
Lake
Winnebago
in
Wisconsin
.

Supposedly
the
last
two
letters
were
transposed
by
the
Post
Office
during
the
application
process
.

The
local
pronunciation
,
however
,
has
remained
Ah-low-wa
rather
than
Ah-lo-ha
.

The
community
attempted
to
incorporate
in
0000
,
but
the
regional
boundary
commission
halted
the
effort
after
determining
the
community
could
not
provide
the
needed
municipal
services
of
a
city
.

In
0000
,
a
public
library
was
opened
in
space
within

strip
mall
shopping

on

Road
at

Community
Library

History
In
0000
,
Benjamin
Cornelius
emigrated
to
Oregon
with
his
family
,
travelling
with
Joseph
Meek
.

The
Cornelius
family
settled
on
the
Tualatin
Plains
,
near
what
is
now
North
Plains
.

The
same
year
,
Benjamin
Q.
Tucker
and
Solomon
Emerick
staked
land
claims
and
established
farms
on
the
land
that
would
eventually
become
Cornelius
.

At
that
time
,
the
area
was
called
Free
Orchards
;
there
was
no
actual
community
,
but
the
name
referred
to
the
orchards
on
the
of
land
.

In
0000
,
Benjamin
Cornelius
's
son
Colonel
Thomas
R.
Cornelius
learned
that
Ben
Holladay
planned
to
extend
the
Oregon
and
California
Railroad
right
through
Free
Orchards
.

Holladay
had
been
told
by
Forest
Grove
and
Hillsboro
that
they
would
not
allow
the
railroad
free
right-of-way
,
so
Holladay
planned
to
bypass
them
,
and
build
Free
Orchards
into
a
new
city
that
would
become
the
new
county
seat
of
Washington
County
.

The
new
railroad
was
approaching
Free
Orchards
in
0000
,
and
Cornelius
saw
an
opportunity
to
benefit
from
the
new
railroad
.

He
left
his
farm
and
built
a
new
house
,
a
warehouse
,
and
a
store
in
Free
Orchards
.

The
warehouse
and
store
were
located
right
next
to
the
railroad
,
and
so
became
natural
places
for
local
farmers
to
trade
and
store
their
goods
.

Cornelius
also
built
a
creamery
to
process
milk
,
and
two
sawmills
to
supply
lumber
for
the
growing
community
.

In
addition
,
he
helped
to
build
the
first
frame
schoolhouse
and
the
Methodist
Church
.

In
0000
,
Free
Orchards
was
incorporated
and
renamed
"
Cornelius
"
,
to
honor
the
man
who
spent
many
years
helping
build
the
community
.

Though
Holladay
's
plan
to
make
Free
Orchards
into
the
county
seat
never
materialized
,
Cornelius
survives
today
as
an
agricultural
town
and
,
increasingly
,
as
a
suburb
of
Portland
.

Education
In
0000
,
the
Cornelius
Elementary
School
District
0
was
founded
.

The
Cornelius
district
was
dissolved
in
0000
,
with
the
western
parts
of
the
enrollment
area
going
to
the
Forest
Grove
district
and
the
eastern
part
going
to
the
Hillsboro
districts
.

Transportation
Cornelius
is
within
the
TriMet
district
,
and
public
transit
service
is
provided
by
TriMet
's
bus
line
00-TV
Highway
,
which
operates
seven
days
a
week
.

to
the

locals
as

History
Prior
to
the
0000s
when
Euro-Americans
settled
the
area
,
the
Atfalati
band
of
the
Kalapuya
Native
American
tribe
lived
on
the
Tualatin
Plains
in
what
is
now
Forest
Grove
.

In
0000
,
Alvin
T.
and
Abigail
Smith
were
among
the
earliest
to
use
the
Oregon
Trail
and
settled
on
what
was
first
known
as
West
Tualatin
Plain
.

They
overwintered
with
Henry
Harmon
Spalding
,
arriving
in
what
is
now
Forest
Grove
in
the
fall
.

Intending
to
be
missionaries
,
they
found
little
potential
as
most
of
the
natives
had
succumbed
to
European
diseases
.

Smith
served
as
the
community
's
first
postmaster
beginning
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
his
log
cabin
served
as
the
post
office
.

According
to
Oregon
Geographic
Names
,
the
name
Forest
Grove
was
selected
on
January
00
,
0000
,
at
a
meeting
of
the
trustees
of
Tualatin
Academy
(
later
known
as
Pacific
University
)
.

Resident
and
school
trustee
J.
Quinn
Thornton
suggested
the
name
,
which
he
also
had
used
for
the
name
of
his
homestead
.

The
name
referred
to
a
grove
of
oak
trees
that
still
stand
on
what
is
now
the
campus
of
the
university
.

,
competitor

Pacific
(

)
followed
suit
,
opening
its
own

,
separate

's
.

Both
railroads
provided
freight
and
passenger
service
,
SP
's
passenger
service
being
known
as
the
Red
Electric
.

A
company
called
the
Forest
Grove
Transportation
Company
operated
local
streetcar
service
,
but
this
lasted
only
from
0000
–

The
Red
Electric
passenger
service
to

History
Early
history
Prior
to
the
arrival
of
European
immigrants
in
the
0000s
,
little
is
known
about
Native
American
settlements
in
the
Gaston
area
.

What
is
known
indicates
that
Native
Americans
in
the
area
lived
similarly
to
other
Pacific
Northwest
tribes
.

In
nearby
Cherry
Grove
there
are
a
few
petroglyph
s
usually
credited
to
the
Atfalati
tribe
,
which
is
a
division
of
Kalapuya
.

Like
many
other
indigenous
peoples
in
North
America
,
it
is
thought
as
many
as
00
%
of
the
local
population
were
killed
by
smallpox
,
malaria
,
influenza
or
other
European
diseases
even
before
the
area
began
to
feel
the
presence
of
significant
European
settlement
.

Schools
In
the
0000s
,
the
census
recorded
only
about
00
people
in
the
Gaston
area
.

Nonetheless
,
in
0000
,
the
first
Gaston
School
was
founded
.

In
0000
,
a
new
school
was
built
near
the
connecting
road
between
Old
Highway
00
and
the
new
Highway
00
.

Initially
students
only
attended
school
for
0
–
0
months
per
year
,
later
expanded
to
0
months
.

In
0000
,
as
a
stage
coach
line
brought
more
settlers
,
and
in
anticipation
of
a
new
rail
line
,
railroad
developer
and
town
namesake
Joseph
Gaston
set
aside
of
land
on
what
was
then
the
edge
of
town
for
a
school
.

Rail
services
In
the
early
0000s
,
stagecoach
and
rail
service
was
expanding
rapidly
in
Washington
County
.

By
0000
,
a
stop
on
the
Portland-St
.

Joseph
line
in
Patton
Valley
was
officially
named
Gaston
.

With
a
train
stop
,
more
people
came
and
by
0000
a
post
office
opened
in
the
new
town
.

The
same
year
,
the
first
church
,
Gaston
Congregational
Church
,
was
also
built
.

In
the
0000s
,
Joseph
Gaston
was
responsible
for
draining
Wapato
Lake
,
which
lay
in
the
valley
around
the
rail
stop
,
creating
the
farmland
that
exists
today
.
"

Wapato
"
is
a
word
from
the
local
Indians
that
refers
to
a
water-based
starchy
root
vegetable
related
to
arrowroot
sometimes
called
a
"
water
potato
"
in
local
English
.

Rail
service
ended
in
0000
with
the
removal
of
rails
back
to
the
junction
to
the
Seghers
spur
.

0000
to
present
The
addition
of
a
spur
line
to
the
nearby
Cherry
Grove
area
for
the
construction
of
a
lumber
mill
in
0000
added
significant
activity
to
the
local
economy
,
although
it
had
to
be
shut
down
in
0000
during
a
lumber
market
crash
.

The
crash
of
0000
notwithstanding
,
by
0000
Gaston
had
added
a
bank
,
J.H.
Wescott
and
Sons
General
Merchandise
,
Bell
&
Owens
General
Mercantile
Company
,
and
other
businesses
.

In
early
May
0000
workers
at
the
Stimson
Mill
went
on
strike
.

On
May
00
,
"
twenty-five
cars
loaded
with
pickets
left
the
Labor
Temple
in
Portland
"
to
support
the
strikers
.

The
next
morning
Governor
Charles
Martin
ordered
the
state
police
and
National
Guard
to
protect
the
strikebreakers
.

Armed
with
gas
grenades
and
machine
guns
,
the
military
and
police
forces
demanded
the
strikers
leave
or
be
shot
.

The
strikers
chose
to
disperse
,
averting
a
potential
bloodbath
.

New
high
school
In
0000
a
new
high
school
was
built
on
the
land
Joseph
Gaston
had
previously
set
aside
for
a
school
.

That
high
school
was
in
use
through
the
0000-0000
school
year
,
when
it
was
condemned
.

The
condemning
of
the
building
became
a
crucial
local
issue
for
the
town
,
with
residents
split
between
merging
with
a
nearby
district
(
both
Forest
Grove
or
Yamhill
were
considered
)
,
and
building
a
new
high
school
.

In
the
end
,
a
new
high
school
was
built
and
Gaston
retained
its
independent
school
system
and
with
it
a
degree
of
local
pride
.

Currently
the
Gaston
School
District
is
a
full
K-00
district
,
with
000
students
total
in
0000
,
and
a
single
high
school
.

Modern
expansion
The
growing
popularity
of
Portland
and
the
Pacific
Northwest
in
general
has
led
to
population
growth
throughout
the
region
.

Though
too
far
from
Portland
to
benefit
much
at
first
,
recently
Gaston
has
started
to
see
new
housing
and
an
uptick
in
school
registrations
.

The
late
0000s
brought
a
new
fire
station
and
the
0000s
baseball/softball-oriented
park
.

Just
after
0000
,
a
new
post
office
was
built
on
the
edge
of
town
.

Thus
far
,
the
town
has
not
been
able
to
effectively
capitalize
on
the
local
wine
industry
's
growing
national
and
international
recognition
.

In
0000
,
the
mayoral
candidate
advocated
obtaining
state
or
federal
funding
to
revitalize
the
commercial
strip
on
Main
Street
which
,
in
theory
,
could
help
the
city
capture
some
of
the
wine
tourism
dollars
.

Hillsboro
is
the
fifth-largest
city

,
such
as

,
that
compose
what
has
become
known
as
the
Silicon
Forest
.

At
the
0000
Census
,
the
city
's
population
was
00,000
.

For
thousands
of
years
before
the
arrival
of
European-American
settlers
,
the
Atfalati
tribe
of
the
Kalapuya
lived
in
the
Tualatin
Valley
near
the
later
site
of
Hillsboro
.

The
climate
,
moderated
by
marine
influence
from

,
helped
make
the
region
suitable
for
fishing

Settlers
founded
a

later
named
after
David
Hill
,
an
Oregon
politician

Transportation
by
riverboat
on
the
Tualatin

A
railroad
reached
the
area
in

and
an
interurban
electric
railway
about
four
decades
later
.

These
railways
,
as
well
as

History
The
first
people
of
the
Tualatin
Valley
were
the
Atfalati
or
Tualaty
tribe
of
the
Kalapuya
,
who
inhabited
the
region
for
up
to
00,000
years
before
white
settlers
arrived
.

The
valley
consisted
of
open
grassland
maintained
by
annual
burning
by
the
Atfalati
,
with
scattered
groves
of
trees
along
the
streams
.

The
Kalapuya
moved
from
place
to
place
in
good
weather
to
fish
and
hunt
and
to
gather
nuts
,
seeds
,
roots
,
and
berries
.

Important
foods
included
camas
and
wapato
,
and
the
Atfalati
traded
for
salmon
from
Chinookan
tribes
near
Willamette
Falls
on
the
Willamette
River
.

During
the
winter
,
they
lived
in
longhouses
in
settled
villages
,
some
near
what
became
Hillsboro
and
Beaverton
.

Their
population
was
greatly
reduced
after
contact
in
the
late
00th
century
with
Europeans
,
who
carried
smallpox
,
syphilis
,
and
malaria
.

Of
the
original
population
of
0,000
to
0,000
Atfalati
reported
in

Tualatin
Valley
in
0000
,
followed

more
pioneers
in
0000
.

The
locality
went
by
two
other
names
—
East
Tualatin
Plains

was
named
"

Hill
was
to
be
paid
$

sold
for
the
town
site
,
but
he
died
before

,
the
Oregon
and
California
Railroad
line
was
extended
to
the
area
,
but
it
ran
just
south
of
town
because
the
city
did
not
want
to
give
the
railroad
land
in
exchange
for
the
rail
connection
.

Hillsboro
was
incorporated
as
the
Town

Hillsboro
on
October

Geography
Hillsboro
is
located
at

The
United
States
Census
Bureau
reports
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of

equivalent
to

The
city
is
located
in
the
Tualatin
Valley
,
and
the
Tualatin
River
forms
part
of
the
southern
city
limits
.

The
city
's
terrain
is
fairly
level
,
consistent
with
an
agricultural
past
and
the
farms
still
in
operation
.

Hillsboro
is
about
west
of
Portland
,
and
immediately
west
of
Beaverton
,
at
an

Hillsboro
's
street
system
differs
from
many
others
in
the
county
.

Most
cities
in
Washington
County
use
a
numbering
system
and
cardinal
direction
orientation
based
on
a
grid
that
begins
at
the
Willamette
River
in
downtown
Portland
,
which
was
originally
part
of
Washington
County
.

For
example
,
the
street
names
in
Beaverton
generally
include
Southwest
(
SW
)
prefixes
because
Beaverton
lies
in
the
southwest
quadrant
of
the
Portland
grid
.

In
Hillsboro
,
some
county
road
names
and
addresses
conform
to
the
Portland
grid
instead
of
Hillsboro
's
internal
cardinal
direction
grid
,
and
the
city
has
been
working
to
make
addresses
and
streets
within
Hillsboro
conform
to
the
internal
grid
.

The
internal
grid
in
Hillsboro
centers
on
the
downtown
intersection
of
Main
Street
,
which
runs
east
–
west
,
and
First
Avenue
,
which
runs
north
–
south
.

Most
addresses
within
the
city
include
a
quadrant
prefix
:
NW
,
NE
,
SW
,
or
SE
.

Main
Street
is
simply
designated
as
East
Main
or
West
Main
,
and
First
Avenue
is
only
North
First
or
South
First
.

Addresses
on
the
streets
'
south
side
and
the
avenues
'
east
side
have
even
numbers
,
while
odd
numbers
are
on
the
opposite
side
.

Hillsboro

street
system
contains
00

Moonshine
,
white
lightning
,
mountain
dew
,
hooch
,
or
Tennessee
white
whiskey
is
a
high-proof
distilled
spirit
,
generally
produced
illicitly
.

The
word
is
believed
to
derive
from
the
term
"
moonrakers
"
used
for
early
English
smugglers
and
the
clandestine
(
i.e.
,
by
the
light
of
the
moon
)
nature
of
the
operations
of
illegal
Appalachia
n
distillers
who
produced
and
distributed
whiskey
.

Prevalence
Varieties
of
moonshine
are
produced
throughout
the
world
.

Safety
Poorly
produced
moonshine
can
be
contaminated
,
mainly
from
materials
used
in
construction
of
the
still
.

Stills
employing
used
automotive
radiators
as
condensers
are
particularly
dangerous
;
in
some
cases
,
glycol
,
products
from
antifreeze
,
can
appear
as
well
.

Radiators
used
as
condensers
also
may
contain
lead
at
the
connections
to
the
plumbing
.

Both
glycol
and
lead
are
poisonous
and
potentially
deadly
.

Although
methanol
is
not
produced
in
toxic
amounts
by
fermentation
of
sugars
from
grain
starches
,
contamination
is
still
possible
by
unscrupulous
distillers
using
cheap
methanol
to
increase
the
apparent
strength
of
the
product
.

Moonshine
can
be
made
both
more
palatable
and
less
damaging
by
discarding
the
"
foreshot
"
—
the
first
few
ounces
of
alcohol
that
drip
from
the
condenser
.

The
foreshot
contains
most
of
the
methanol
,
if
any
,
from
the
mash
because
methanol
vaporizes
at
a
lower
temperature
than
ethanol
.

The
foreshot
also
typically
contains
small
amounts
of
other
undesirable
compounds
such
as
acetone
and
various
aldehydes
.

Alcohol
concentrations
above
about
00
%
alcohol
by
volume
(
000
proof
)
are
flammable
and
therefore
dangerous
to
handle
.

This
is
especially
true
during
the
distilling
process
when
vaporized
alcohol
may
accumulate
in
the
air
to
dangerous
concentrations
if
adequate
ventilation
has
not
been
provided
.

Tests
A
quick
estimate
of
the
alcoholic
strength
,
or
proof
,
of
the
distillate
(
the
ratio
of
alcohol
to
water
)
is
often
achieved
by
shaking
a
clear
container
of
the
distillate
.

Large
bubbles
with
a
short
duration
indicate
a
higher
alcohol
content
,
while
smaller
bubbles
that
disappear
more
slowly
indicate
the
increasing
presence
of
water
.

A
common
folk
test
for
the
quality
of
moonshine
was
to
pour
a
small
quantity
of
it
into
a
spoon
and
set
it
on
fire
.

The
theory
was
that
a
safe
distillate
burns
with
a
blue
flame
,
but
a
tainted
distillate
burns
with
a
yellow
flame
.

Practitioners
of
this
simple
test
also
held
that
if
a
radiator
coil
had
been
used
as
a
condenser
,
then
there
would
be
lead
in
the
distillate
,
which
would
give
a
reddish
flame
.

This
led
to
the
mnemonic
,
"
Lead
burns
red
and
makes
you
dead
.
"

Although
the
flame
test
will
show
the
presence
of
lead
and
fusel
oils
,
it
will
not
reveal
the
presence
of
methanol
(
also
poisonous
)
,
which
burns
with
an
invisible
flame
.

The
traditional
test
used
by
British
sailors
involved
gunpowder
to
"
prove
"
that
their
rum
was
not
watered
down
(
contained
at
least
00
%
ABV
.

Sherwood
is
a
city
in
Washington
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

Located
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
county
,
it
is
a
residential
community
in
the
Tualatin
Valley
southwest
of
Portland
.

The

census
.

According
to
the
0000
census
,
the
population

residents
.

Indirectly
named
for
the
Sherwood
Forest
in
England
,
it
was
first
incorporated
in
0000
as
a
town
.

History
What
is
now
the
Sherwood
area
was
originally
inhabited
by
the
Atfalati
band
of
the
Kalapuya
nation
.

The
first
significant
wave
of
United
States
emigrants
arrived
in
0000
.

Native
Americans
were
relocated
to
reservations
after
the
Donation
Land
Claim
Act
of
0000-0
gave
American
citizens
exclusive
ownership
of
these
lands
.

Sherwood
is
known
the
be
the
home
of
MLB
player
Don
Wilson
.

The
relocation
process
took
place
under
the
guidance
of
a
series
of
federal
employees
,
most
notably
Superintendent
of
Indian
Affairs
Joel
Palmer
,
who
was
severely
criticized
for
his
humane
treatment
of
the
tribes
.

The
California
Gold
Rush
of
0000
caused
a
dramatic
shift
in
the
area
's
economy
.

Oregon
City
,
Oregon
is
located
on
a
stretch
of
the
Willamette
River
that
had
always
been
attractive
to
trade
since
prehistoric
times
,
when
trading
activity
was
dominated
by
the
Chinookan
tribe
.

When
settlers
of
European
extraction
began
arriving
in
large
numbers
,
Oregon
City
became
(
arguably
)
the
"
End
of
the
Oregon
Trail
"
.

After
the
Gold
Rush
,
however
,
Portland
,
Oregon
replaced
Oregon
City
as
the
area
's
most
important
center
of
trade
and
commerce
.

Sherwood
is
located
within
twenty
miles
(
00
km
)
of
both
cities
.

The
name
"
Sherwood
"
arose
from
a
declination
of
naming
the
town
"
Smock
Ville
"
after
its
co-founders
James
Christopher
and
Mary
Ellen
Smock
.

In
0000
,
the
Smocks
gave
a
right-of-way
on
their
property
to
the
Portland
and
Willamette
Valley
Railway
.

The
Smocks
platted
the
town
in
0000
,
the
same
year
rail
service
began
.

Tradition
has
it
that
no
one
,
not
even
the
town
's
founders
,
liked
the
name
"
Smock
Ville
,
"
and
so
a
public
meeting
was
held
to
rename
the
town
.

A
prominent
businessman
,
Robert
Alexander
,
suggested
the
name
"
Sherwood
.
"

According
to
post
office
records
,
Alexander
was
from
Sherwood
,
Michigan
,
and
this
was
the
town
that
was
named
after
Sherwood
Forest
England
.

Department

Smock
was
the
first
postmaster
.

Town
of
Sherwood
was
incorporated
under
Oregon
Senate
Bill

in

The
main
industry
in
the

was
a
pressed
brick
yard
which
closed
in
0000
,
a
victim
of
the
deep
recession
of
0000
.

The
Klondike
Gold
Rush
of
0000
revived
Sherwood
's
economy
.

In
0000
,
Money
placed
Sherwood
among
the
twenty
most
livable
towns
in
America
.

In

at

History
The
origin
of
Carlton
's
name
is
disputed
.

An
ex-county
commissioner
claims
that
the
name
was
derived
from
Wilson
Carl
,
whereas
A.
E.
Bones
,
postmaster
at
Carlton
,
stated
in
a
0000
letter
that
it
was
named
for
John
Carl
,
Sr.
,
at
the
request
of
R.
R.
Thompson
.

These
men
may
have
been
part
of
the
same
family
.

Carlton
post
office
was
established
in

,
with

postmaster

Actual
history
of
Carlton
,
Oregon
:
Prior
to
the
post
office
inside
the
city
of
Carlton
,
Wilson
Carl
,
owned
the
original
Post
Office
,
Stagecoach
stop
,
and
Blacksmith
shop
,
for
the
area
,
about
0
miles
West
of
Carlton
,
and
his
home
was
known
as
Mountain
House
.

Wilson
Carl
was
the
original
postmaster
.

Wilson
Carl
traveled
with
Dr.
Joel
Knight
,
on
the
Oregon
Trail
,
to
the
area
,
as
witnessed
in
the
diary
of
Amelia
Stewart
Knight
.

Wilson
Carl
negotiated
with
the
railroad
in
Portland
,
Oregon
,
to
build
closer
to
his
property
.

Since
the
original
plot
was
over
the
mountain
West
of
Carlton
,
it
was
a
matter
of
convenience
for
the
railroad
to
build
where
it
presently
is
,
because
negotiating
the
mountain
was
not
feasible
.

The
population
of
Carlton
expanded
to
become
the
city
of
Carlton
,
around
the
railroad
.

The
city
is
named
after
Wilson
Carl
,
and
,
was
originally
called
Carl
's
town
,
and
,
a
few
other
variations
of
his
name
were
used
before
the
name
became
Carlton
.

Wilson
Carl
began
as
a
pioneer
carpenter/builder
and
shoemaker
who
became
a
wealthy
land
owner
,
who
built
a
portion
of
what
is
now
Linfield
College
,
in
McMinnville
,
and
was
founder
of
the
Republican
Party
in
McMinnville
,
County
Commissioner
,
and
,
at
one
time
owned
the
property
that
the
Yamhill
County
Courthouse
presently
sits
on
.

The
original
post
office
still
exists
on
his
original
homestead
and
plot
of
land
,
though
it
has
since
been
used
as
a
residence
for
his
heirs
and
is
currently
unoccupied
.

McMinnville
UFO
photographs
McMinnville
is
known
among
UFO
researchers
for
now-famous
photographs
published
on
the
front
page
of
the
June
0
,
0000
edition
of
the
city
's
newspaper
,
the
News-Register
(
then
known
as
the
Telephone-Register
)
,
reportedly
of
an
unidentified
flying
object
seen
almost
a
month
earlier
,
May
00
.

The
Oregonian
published
the
photographs
the
next
day
,
and
within
a
month
they
were
published
in
LIFE
magazine
.

The
photographs
were
taken
on
a
farm
near
McMinnville
by
a
farming
couple
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Paul
Trent
.

Mrs.
Trent
was
the
first
to
see
the
object
—
it
resembled
a
classic
"
flying
saucer
"
—
and
she
pointed
it
out
to
her
husband
,
who
obtained
a
camera
from
their
farmhouse
and
took
two
photos
before
the
"
saucer
"
flew
away
.

A
debate
has
raged
for
decades
between
UFO
researchers
,
who
claim
that
the
photos
are
genuine
and
are
among
the
best
ever
taken
of
a
UFO
,
and
UFO
skeptics/debunkers
,
who
claim
that
the
photos
are
a
hoax
.

Both
sides
in
the
debate
have
hired
photographic
experts
numerous
times
to
do
a
professional
analysis
of
the
photos
,
but
so
far
neither
side
has
offered
convincing
evidence
to
prove
their
case
.

The
Trents
'
background
was
also
thoroughly
checked
,
and
to
date
no
evidence
has
surfaced
implicating
them
in
a
hoax
.

The
whole
sequence
of
events
has
led
to
a
"
UFO
Festival
"
being
held
in
McMinnville
each
year
,
which
is
the
biggest
such
gathering
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
,
and
second
in
the
country

to
Roswell
,
New
Mexico
's

Turkey
Rama
is
a
three-day
festival
held
in
downtown
McMinnville
celebrating
the

,
when

booming
turkey-farming
industry
.

Now
,
commercial
exhibitions
have
replaced
the

exhibitions
"

and
so
the
turkey-judging
competitions
and

races
have
been
eliminated
in
favor
of
more
"

"
rides
,
booths
,

had
settled
in
the
area
in
0000
.

The
Sheridan
post
office
was
established
on
April
0
,
0000
,
with
Absolem
's
brother
Thomas
serving
as
postmaster
.

By
0000
the
town
had
grown
to
include
two
blacksmith
shops
,
one
church
,
one
school
,
one
hotel
,
one
wagon
shop
,
and
two

In
October
0000
,
the
Dayton
,
Sheridan
and
Grande
Ronde
Railroad
,
a
narrow
gauge
railway
,
reached
the
community
.

The
city
,
a
timber
and
farming
community
southwest
of
Portland
and
northwest
of
Salem
,
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

Sheridan
was
named
for
General
Philip
Sheridan
,
who
was
posted
to
Yamhill
County
and
Fort
Yamhill
in
the
latter
half
of
the
0000s
to
monitor
the
Native
Americans
at
what
is
now
the
Grand
Ronde
Reservation
west
of
the
city
.

By
0000
,
the
city
had
grown
to
000
residents
,
one
bank
,
two
hotels
,
three
churches
,
and
a
flouring
mill
.

At
that
time
there
was
a
daily
train
to
the
city
as
well
as
daily
stage
coach
service
from
McMinnville
,
and
a
single
wooden
bridge
over
the
river
.

Agriculture
was
the
main
industry
in
the
city
's
early
years
.

Around
0000
,
the
main
crops
included
hops
,
clover-seed
,
hay
,
potatoes
,
onions
,
and
a
variety
of
fruits
including
apples
,
prunes
,
and
pears
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
a
fire
that
destroyed
most
of
the
commercial
district
caused
$
000,000
in
damage
.

Most
of
the
buildings
were
rebuilt
with
brick
within
six
months
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
the
Jesuits
purchased
an
farm
on
a
hill
overlooking
the
city
.

There
they
started
St.
Francis
Xavier
's
Novitiate
,
a
school
for
training
priests
for
the
order
.

Opening
in
a
new
building
and
several
existing
farm
buildings
in
0000
,
St.
Francis
Xavier
's
added
more
buildings
over
the
next
several
decades
.

In
0000
,
the
state
built
a
highway
through
Sheridan
from
McMinnville
to
the
Oregon
Coast
,
which
became
Oregon
Route
00
or
the
Salmon
River
Highway
.

With
funds
received
through
the
Works
Progress
Administration
,
the
current
steel
bridge
across
the
South
Yamhill
River
was
built
and
opened
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
agriculture
was
still
a
major
industry
,
and
the
timber
industry
was
growing
in
importance
to
the
local
economy
.

At
that
time
the
city
had
grown
to
a
population
of
0,000
people
.

The
state
built
a
bypass
around
Sheridan
and
Willamina
that
opened
in
0000
to
carry
Oregon
Route
00
on
the
south
end
of
the
city
.

The
old
alignment
through
the
center
of
town
became
Oregon
Route
00
Business
.

Sheridan
had
its
largest
flooding
in
history
on
December
00
,
0000
.

The
South
Yamhill
overflowed
its
banks
and
isolated
the
town
for
two
days
.

The
Jesuits
sold
their
training
school
in
0000
to
the
Delphian
Foundation
,
who
then
opened
The
Delphian
School
at
the
site
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
a
federal
minimum
and
medium
security
prison
,
Federal
Correctional
Institution
-
Sheridan
,
opened
on
the
south
side
of
the
city
.

At
that
time
,
Sheridan
had
a
population
of
around
0,000
people
.

Sheridan
moved
its
city
hall
into
the
old
railroad
station
in
January
0000
,
and
expanded
the
renovated
building
in
0000
.

The
U.S.
Census
Bureau
erroneously
listed
the
city
's
population
as
0,000
in
the
0000
Census
after
mis-listing
the
prison
's
population
in
the
wrong
census
tract
.

This
error
of
about
0000
people
was
enough
to
throw
off
the
state
legislative
districts
beyond
their
margin
of
acceptance
and
the
Oregon
Supreme
Court
ruled
the
Secretary
of
State
must
re-draw
the
boundary
lines
to
match
the
correct
data
.

The
city
also
counts
the
prison
population
as
part
of
the
city
’s
official
population
.

In
December
0000
,
a
two-alarm
fire
gutted
the
0000
United
Methodist
Church
in
the
city
.
