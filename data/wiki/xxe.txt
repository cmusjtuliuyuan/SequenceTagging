Battle
of
Middle
Boggy
Depot
A
small
Civil
War
confrontation
occurred
on
February
00
,
0000
north
of
Atoka
.

Early
in
0000
,
Colonel
William
A.
Philips
set
out
with
some
0000
Union
troops
from
Fort
Gibson
,
Oklahoma
,
to
cut
a
swath
through
Confederate
Indian
Territory
(
Oklahoma
)
.

Their
purpose
was
to
break
Confederate
control
over
Indian
Territory
and
gain
the
support
and
possibly
recruits
from
the
Native
Americans
.
"

I
take
you
with
me
to
clean
out
the
Indian
Nation
south
of
the
river
and
drive
away
and
destroy
rebels
.

Let
me
say
a
few
words
to
you
that
you
are
not
to
forget
....
Those
who
are
still
in
arms
are
rebels
,
who
ought
to
die
.

Do
not
kill
a
prisoner
after
he
has
surrendered
.

But
I
do
not
ask
you
to
take
prisoners
.

I
ask
you
to
make
your
footsteps
severe
and
terrible
.

(
Creeks
)
the
time
has
now
come
when
you
are
to
remember
the
authors
of
all
your
sufferings
;
those
who
started
a
needless
and
wicked
war
....
Stand
by
me
faithfully
and
we
will
soon
have
peace
....
"
--
Colonel
William
A.
Philips
,
to
his
men
before
beginning
the
campaign
Along
the
way
,
Colonel
Phillips
sent
out
an
advance
of
about
000
men
toward
Boggy
Depot
,
a
large
Confederate
supply
base
located
on
the
Texas
Road
with
the
intention
of
capturing
the
outpost
.

While
en
route
,
his
command
encountered
a
small
Confederate
camp
on
the
banks
of
the
Middle
Boggy
River
,
made
up
of
around
00
Confederate
soldiers
.

In
the
ensuing
skirmish
00
Confederate
soldiers
were
killed
.

Among
the
dead
were
those
wounded
who
had
been
left
behind
when
their
comrades
retreated
.

They
were
found
on
the
battlefield
with
their
throats
slashed
.

There
were
no
Union
deaths
as
a
result
of
the
battle
.

Founding
Though
the
Choctaw
Indians
had
inhabited
the
area
since
the
0000s
with
a
small
town
located
near
the
city
today
,
the
city
was
officially
founded
by
a
Baptist
Missionary
named
J.S.
Murrow
in
0000
and
quickly
supplanted
the
dying
town
of
Boggy
Depot
as
the
chief
city
in
Atoka
County
.

A
main
contributing
factor
in
the
early
growth
of
Atoka
was
the
MKT
Railroad
,
which
came
through
the
area
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
railroad
provided
the
economic
lifeblood
to
Atoka
that
any
isolated
rural
town
needs
to
survive
and
flourish
.

Also
during
this
time
about
0000
,
the
third
Governor
of
Oklahoma
and
first
Chief
Justice
of
the
Oklahoma
Supreme
Court
,
Robert
L.
Williams
,
moved
to
Atoka
(
then
a
part
of
the
old
Indian
Territory
)
from
Troy
,
Alabama
.

Recent
developments
Despite
being
strategically
located
at
the
intersection
of
two
major
highways
(
especially
U.S.
00
,
a
major
transportation
artery
in
the
region
)
,
Atoka
is
struggling
to
create
a
town
attractive
to
both
new
business
and
new
residents
.

Even
though
the
town
has
experienced
an
economic
upturn
in
the
past
few
years
,
it
still
lacks
the
main
thing
that
ensures
economic
prosperity
and
attracts
new
residents
:
well-paying
jobs
.

However
,
there
is
a
beacon
of
hope
for
Atoka
in
the
future
.

For
the
past
several
years
,
economic
growth
has
been
steadily
moving
northward
along
U.S.
00
from
Dallas
,
Texas
.

Two
towns
located
to
the
south
of
Atoka
,
Durant
,
Oklahoma
;
and
Sherman
,
Texas
,
are
experiencing
tremendous
economic
and
population
growth
.

As
this
wave
of
development
gradually
moves
north
,
the
next
town
in
line
is
the
city
of
Atoka
.

If
the
growth
continues
,
it
is
possible
that
Atoka
could
begin
to
see
the
type
of
expansion
currently
underway
across
the
Red
River
to
the
south
.

Economy
Atoka
is
traditionally
a
ranching
and
farming
community
with
its
economic
base
firmly
planted
in
agriculturally
related
venues
.

However
,
in
recent
years
,
efforts
have
been
made
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
the
City
Council
,
and
various
other
local
leaders
to
create
new
industrial
jobs
in
Atoka
and
Atoka
County
.

Currently
,
an
industrial
park
is
open
for
development
north
of
the
city
on
U.S.
Highway
00
,
as
well
as
a
smaller
park
on
U.S.
Highway
00
west
of
town
.

In
August
0000
,
the
city
's
largest
employer
,
Ethan
Allen
Furniture
,
announced
that
it
would
be
closing
its
Atoka
plant
in
favor
of
"
selected
off-shore
vendors
"
,
as
reported
in
the
The
Oklahoman
following
the
announcement
of
the
plant
's
closing
.

With
the
closure
of
the
Ethan
Allen
plant
,
located
north
of
the
city
proper
,
more
than
two
hundred
people
lost
their
jobs
(
many
of
whom
had
held
them
since
the
plant
opened
)
.

As
of
May
,
0000
,
Ethan
Allen
has
resumed
operations
at
the
Atoka
plant
,
converting
the
former
manufacturing
facility
to

distribution
center

Texas
to
Minnesota
)
,
State
Highway
0
,
State
Highway
0
,

History
Originally
named
Springtown
,
for
the
natural
springs
that
flow
out
of
the
hills
the
town
is
built
upon
,
the
current
name
is
believed
to
be
a
corruption
.

Once
home
to
a
bank
,
theater
and
pub
,
the
town
has
declined
over
the
years
,
both
economically
and
in
population
.

In
the
past
five
years
,
small
population
growth
and
the
addition
of
a
new
cafe
have
brought
new
life
to
the
town
.

Annually
in
September
,
the
Good
Ole
Days
Festival
celebrates
the
town
's
past
with
parade
,
cookout
,
and
concert
.

On
August
0
,
0000
,
while
Bonnie
Parker
was
visiting
her
mother
,
Clyde
Barrow
and
two
associates
were
drinking
alcohol
at
a
dance
in
Stringtown
(
illegal
under
Prohibition
)
.

When
they
were
approached
by
sheriff
C.
G.
Maxwell
and
his
deputy
,
Clyde
opened
fire
,
killing
deputy
Eugene
C.
Moore
.

That
was
the
first
killing
of
a
lawman
by
what
was
later
known
as
the
Barrow
Gang
,
a
total
which
would
eventually
amount
to
nine
slain
officers
.

In

late
0000s
,
a
tornado
touched
down
in
the
town
directly
on
top
of
the
(
then
)
recently
built
Community
Center
,
now
the
Senior
Citizen
's
Center
.

The
tornado
was
only
on
the
ground
for
a
few
seconds
,
but
during
that
time
the
building
was
almost
completely
destroyed
.

It
was
an
unusual
occurrence
for
a
tornado
to
touch
down
in
the
town
itself
,
given
its
being
situated
between
two
chains

and
Historic
U.S.
Route

in
Western
Oklahoma
,
approximately
west
of
Oklahoma
City
and
east

.

History
European
Exploration
In
0000
,
Francisco
Vázquez
de
Coronado
became
the
first
known
Europe
an
to
pass
through
the
area
.

The
Spanish
conquistador
was
traveling
northeast
across
the
prairie
in
search
of
a
place
called
Quivira
,
a
city
said
to
be
fabulously
wealthy
with
gold
.

Because
Coronado
's
route
across
the
plains
is
speculative
,
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
expedition
passed
through
present-day
Elk
City
or
the
nearby
area
.

Founding
to
statehood
Elk
City
's
history
dates
back
to
the
days
immediately
following
the
opening
of
the
Cheyenne-Arapaho
reservation
in
western
Oklahoma
Territory
on
April
00
,
0000
,
when
the
first
white
settlers
made
their
appearance
.

Prior
to
this
time
,
many
early
ranchers
had
driven
cattle
over
the
Great
Western
Cattle
Trail
from
Texas
to
Dodge
City
,
Kansas
,
the
present
townsite
of
Elk
City
being
in
the
direct
path
of
that
famous
trail
.

The
creation
of
Elk
City
was
an
idea
conceived
by
land
promoters
from
Weatherford
,
Oklahoma
when
they
learned
that
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
(
CO
&
G
)
was
coming
to
the
area
(
in
0000
,
the
CO
&
G
Railroad
completed
its
western
route
to
Weatherford
;
beginning
in
0000
,
it
continued
building
west
)
.

They
formed
the
Choctaw
Townsite
and
Development
Company
.

These
men
with
great
foresight
determined
that
the
area
at
the
source
of
Elk
Creek
would
be
an
ideal
location
for
a
town
,
so
they
came
to
the
area
to
purchase
lands
from
the
homesteaders
who
had
claims
along
the
railroad
.

Probably
the
most
important
day
in
Elk
City
's
history
is
March
00
,
0000
,
the
date
the
first
lots
were
sold
by
the
Choctaw
Townsite
and
Development
Company
.

By
this
time
,
hundreds
of
prospective
purchasers
had
built
a
tent
city
.

On
that
day
,
the
townsite
company
sold
$
00,000
worth
of
property
(
about
$
000,000
in
0000
dollars
)
,
and
continued
doing
a
good
business
for
some
time
thereafter
.

There
is
some
confusion
about
how
Elk
City
got
its
name
.

Elk
City
was
so
named
because
it
is
located
at
the
head
of
Elk
Creek
,
which
in
turn
was
named
by
U.S.
Army
Captain
Randolph
B.
Marcy
who
was
leading
an
expedition
to
explore
the
Red
River
in
0000
.

Marcy
and
his
troops
had
left
the
Wichita
Mountains
and
the
waterway
which
he
named
Otter
Creek
during
his
exploration
,
and
they
were
traveling
northwest
along
the
North
Fork
of
the
Red
River
.

On
May
00
,
in
the
official
journal
of
the
expedition
,
Marcy
wrote
about
the
productive
soil
,
the
dense
grass
,
and
the
vertical
red
clay
banks
of
a
"
bold
running
stream
of
good
water
.
"

Continuing
,
he
wrote
,
"
From
the
circumstance
of
having
seen
elk
tracks
upon
the
stream
we
passed
in
our
march
today
,
I
have
called
it
'
Elk
Creek
'
.

I
am
informed
by
our
guide
that
five
years
since
,
elk
were
frequently
seen
in
the
Wichita
Mountains
;
but
now
they
are
seldom
met
with
in
this
part
of
the
country
.
"

Confusion
also
stems
from
the
early
post
offices
that
served
the
residents
of
the
town
.

Even
though
the
town
of
Elk
City
has
had
only
one
name
,
its
early
settlers
were
served
by
a
post
office
named
Crowe
,
and
later
,
one
named
Busch
.

Consequently
,
on
many
early
maps
of
Oklahoma
Territory
the
names
of
"
Crowe
"
or
"
Busch
"
are
seen
instead
of
"
Elk
City
"
.

Finally
,
on
July
00
,
0000
,
shortly
before
statehood
,
the
Busch
Post
Office
had
its
name
officially
changed
to
Elk
City
Post
Office
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
(
purchased
in
0000
by
the
Chicago
,
Rock
Island
and
Pacific
Railroad
in
0000
)
laid
its
last
rail
on
the
so-called
"
Choctaw
Route
"
,
bringing
rail
access
to
Elk
City
.

The
first
regular
train
service
commenced
seven
days
later
on
August
00
,
and
city
folk
rejoiced
,
predicting
that
the
dugouts
,
claim
shacks
,
and
prairie
stables
would
soon
disappear
and
be
replaced
by
handsome
residences
,
commodious
barns
,
and
granaries
.

Later
,
in
0000
,
the
Wichita
Falls
and
Northwestern
Railway
,
one
of
the
Frank
Kell
and
Joseph
A.
Kemp
properties
,
reached
from
Wichita
Falls
,
Texas
,
into
the
wheat-growing
area
of
Western
Oklahoma
.

By
0000
,
the
northern
terminus
was
in
Forgan
in
Beaver
County
in
the
Oklahoma
Panhandle
.

The
route
through
Elk
City
was
abandoned
in
0000
,
as
Altus
became
the
new
northern
terminus
of
the
railroad
,
which
was
absorbed
in
0000
by
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
.

The
remaining
00-mile
link
between
Wichita
Falls
and
Altus
was
absorbed
in
0000
by
the
Wichita
,
Tillman
and
Jackson
Railway
.

By

History
Erick
was
established
in

as
an
agricultural
community
on
what
would
become
the
edge
of
the
Dust
Bowl
during
the
Great
Depression
of
the
0000s
.

was
located
on
the
National
Old
Trails
Road
,
one
of
the
predecessors
to
the
0000
numbered
US
Highway
system
.

Large
segments
of
that
road
became
part
of
U.S.
Route
00
.

The
city
prospered
briefly
in
the
pre-war
era
when
natural
gas
deposits
were
found
in
the
area
.

can
remember
plainly
when

came
out
my
parents
and
other

who
stayed

just
real

After

Congress
wanted
to
stimulate
the
economy
and
aid
the
growth
of
the
nation
.

The
biggest
way
that
they
achieved
this
was
to
promote
the
building
of
the
western
railroads
.

Upon
completion
of
the
Union
Pacific
-
Central
Pacific
joining
together
in

with
the
Golden
Spike
,
other
railroads
trying
to
capitalize
on
commerce
and
trade
also
began
crossing
the
western

.

This
included
the
Great
Northern
and
Burlington
in
the
far
north
,
the
Southern
Pacific
on

this
would
lead
to

around
the
turn
of
the
century
from
the
0000s
to
the
0000s
.

A
new
rail
line
was
extended
from
Weatherford
,
Oklahoma
,
to
Texola
,
Oklahoma
,
by
McCabe
&
Steen
Contractors
,
in
July
0000
.

Entrepreneurs
would
buy
land
near
where
the
new
tracks
were
being
laid
,
and
also
near
a
source
of
water
.

The
Choctaw
Town
site
and
Improvement
Company
did
this
,
and
when
the
railroad
crossed
the
North
Fork
of
the
Red
River
in
Western
Indian
Territory
an
instant
town
sprang
up
,
on
00
September
0000
.

The
Choctaw
Townsite
&
Improvement
Company
began
selling
lots
to
new
“
Sooners
”
arriving
to
start
a
new
life
.

The
seeds
of
new
town
were
on
,
businessmen
came
to
sell
their
wares
to
the
new
town
folk
,
and
within
one
year
the
town
’s
population
was
up
to
around
0,000
.

The
chief
engineer
,
and
a
stockholder
,
for
the
railroad
gave
his
name
to
the
newly
formed
town
,
Robert
Heysham
Sayre
,
of
Pennsylvania
.

The
Chicago
,
Rock
Island
and
Pacific
Railway
Company
(
called
CRI&P
)
,
later
just
the
“
Rock
Island
”
or
Rock
Island
Line
,
leased
the
new
line
.

The
Rock
Island
would
complete
their
march
to
the
Pacific
by
filling
in
the
line
to
Tucumcari
,
New
Mexico
.

In
the
0000s
U.S.
Route
00
,
a
dream
forwarded
by
fellow
Oklahoman
Cyrus
Avery
,
would
come
to
Sayre
,
cementing
the
town
’s
fate
to
fuel
the
cars
and
feed
the
people
exploring
the
country
.

In
0000
film
director
John
Ford
would
use
Sayre
’s
Beckham
County
Courthouse
in
the
film
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
,
based
on
the
famous
book
by
writer
John
Steinbeck
.

During
the
0000s
Sayre
and
the
surrounding
area
would
benefit
from
the
natural
gas
and
oil
development
in
the
Panhandle-Hugoton
field
,
the
largest-volume
gas
field
in
the
United
States
,
and
the
world
’s
largest
known
source
of
helium
.

Between
0000
and
0000
the
field
produced
over
0-trillion
cubic
feet
(
000,000,000
m
³
)
of
gas
.

One
famous
son
of
Sayre
is
balloonist
Maxie
Anderson
.

Born
in
Sayre
,
during
the
height
of
the
Great
Depression
,
00
September
0000
,
Anderson
along
with
Ben
Abruzzo
and
Larry
Newman
were
the
first
people
to
cross
the
Atlantic
Ocean
in
a
balloon
,
the
Double
Eagle
II
,
in
0000
.

Texola
is
a
town
in
Beckham
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00
at
the
0000
census
.

)
,
elevation
0,000
feet
(

.

According
to
the
United

Census
Bureau
,
the
town
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

Texola
is
not
directly
served
by
the
Oklahoma
state
highway
system
.

However
,
the
town
can
be
accessed
from
I-00
Exit
0
.

U.S.
Route
00
passed
through
the
town
,
bringing
scores
of
travelers
,
for
decades
until
I-00
was
completed
to
the
north
in
0000
.

History
The
History
of
Texola
dates
back
to
the
early
0000s
.

Before
being
named
Texola
,
the
town
site
had
been
called
Texokla
and
Texoma
.

Because
of
its
location
near
the
000th
Meridian
,
the
town
was
surveyed
eight
different
times
,
which
meant
that
some
early
residents
lived
in
both
Texas
and
Oklahoma
without
ever
moving
.

Texola
was
originally
part
of
northern
Greer
County
until
Beckham
County
was
formed
after
Oklahoma
gained
statehood
in
0000
.

A
post
office
was
established
in
the
community
on
December
00
,
0000
with
Reuben
H.
Grimes
serving
as
the
first
postmaster
.

In
0000
,
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
(
later
owned
by
the
Chicago
,
Rock
Island
and
Pacific
Railway
)
was
built
through
the
town
.

A
weekly
newspaper
,
the
Texola
Herald
,
began
publishing
in
0000
and
continued
to
operate
into
the
early
0000s
.

By
0000
,
Texola
had
two
cotton
gins
as
well
as
a
corn
and
grist
mill
.

The
local
economy
was
agriculturally-based
and
several
businesses
opened
in
the
community
.

The
0000
census
recorded
000
people
living
in
Texola
.

That
same
year
,
a
small
Territorial
Jail
was
built
.

After
a
slight
decline
in
population
during
the
0000s
,
Texola
grew
rapidly
in
the
0000s
.

The
population
peaked
at
000
in
the
0000
census
.

The
arrival
of
Route
00
(
also
known
as
0th
Street
)
had
a
positive
impact
on
the
local
economy
.

Cotton
production
increased
during
the
decade
,
necessitating
the
need
for
two
additional
gins
.

As
the
town
prospered
,
amenities
such
as
a
ten-acre
park
and
an
auditorium
capable
of
seating
000
people
were
found
in
the
community
.

The
population
began
to
decline
in
the
0000s
and
continued
to
do
so
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
twentieth
century
.

By
0000
,
Texola
was
a
town
of
000
residents
.

When
the
next
census
was
conducted
in
0000
,
Texola
had
lost
nearly
00
percent
of
its
population
,
leaving
just
00
people
in
the
town
.

That
figure
rose
by
two
,
to
00
,
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
the
population
had
decreased
to
0
,
making
Texola
a
ghost
town
.

"

According
to
Encyclopedia
of

History
and
Culture
,
the
town
was
named
for
the
nearby
Caddo
Hills
.

History
The
early
inhabitants
were
Caddos
and
Choctaws
.

After
a
patent
for
the
land
,
located
on
a
buffalo
trail
,
was
obtained
in
0000
,
the
first
settlers
lived
in
tents
.

In
0000
,
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
(
Katy
)
built
a
line
through
the
Choctaw
Nation
and
established
a
station
at
Caddo
.

A
post
office
was
opened
December
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
town
population
was
about
four

people
.

Caddo
quickly
became
a
shipping
and
trade
center
for
the
surrounding
area
.

By

,
Caddo
had
five
cotton
gins
and
a

Caddo
incorporated

Railway
(
Frisco
)
planned
to
build
an

,
land
prices
jumped
up
.

Frisco
officials
decided
to
build
their
line
through
Durant
instead
of
Caddo
.

Durant
then
became
the
fastest-growing
town
,
and
became
the
county
seat
when

County
was
formed
at
statehood
.

By

History
Early
History
Anadarko
got
its
name
when

post
office
was
established
in
0000
.

The
designation
came
from
the
Nadarko
Indians
,
a
branch
of
the
Caddo
,
and
the
"
A
"
was
added
by
clerical
error
.

In
0000
,
the
Wichita
Agency
was
reestablished
on
the
north
bank
of
the
Washita
River

-
Comanche
Agency

History
and
Culture
Carnegie
was
named
after
the
famous
Scottish
American
philanthropist
,
Andrew
Carnegie
.

The
original
name
of
the
town
,
however
was
Lathram
.

The
town
was
originally
platted
as
North
and
South
Lathram
.

North
Lathram
lay
north
of
the
Washita
.

South
Lathram
lay
to
the
South
of
the
Washita
.

North
Lathram
was
really
intended
to
be
the
commercial
hub
.

The
Rock
Island
Railroad
was
supposed
to
go
along
the
north
side
of
the
river
.

The
railroad
was
relocated
along
the
south
bank
of
the
Washita
.

So
South
Lathram
became
the
commercial
hub
.

North
Lathram
withered
and/or
was
never
developed
.

It
was
standard
procedure
to
locate
a
railroad
where
the
land
owner
paid
the
largest
bribe
to
the
owner
of
the
railroad
.

We
have
lost
enough
history
to
be
unable
to
determine
if
this
were
the
case
.

It
was
not
illegal
.

Leaders
of
the
town
decided
shortly
after
incorporation
in
0000
to
rename
the
town
Carnegie
in
the
hopes
he
would
build
a
library
there
.

Although
the
town
has
a
library
,
Andrew
Carnegie
never
built
one
there
.

Of
note
,
there
is
unofficially
a
"
Carnegie
Hall
"
,
known
more
properly
as
the
Carnegie
Memorial
Auditorium
,
where
community
events
are
held

History
On
August
00
,
0000
,
Louise
(
probably
called
Cyril
)
Lookingglass
,
the
infant
daughter
of
Bayard
(
Monapahrah
)
and
Laura
(
Tit-tah-ter-way
)
Lookingglass
was
allotted
of
land
that
would
become
the
Cyril
townsite
.

Louise
Lookingglass
died
in
0000
.

Bayard
Lookingglass
sold
one-half
of
the
allotment
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pierson
on
July
00
,
0000
.

The
Piersons
sold
the
land
to
the
Cyril
Townsite
and
Development
Company
on
September
00
,
0000
.

Although
there
is
some
dispute
,
the
Cyril
Station
appears
to
have
been
named
circa
0000
after
Bayard
and
Laura
Lookingglasses
'
daughter
when
they
granted
the
railroad
permission
to
build
a
section
house
next
to
the
railroad
stop
.

Some
believed
that
the
town
of
Cyril
was
named
after
the
Cyril
Station
of
the
St.
Louis-San
Francisco
Railroad
.

However
a
diligent
search
of
all
sources
including
Frisco
Railroad
,
found
no
supporting
evidence
.

The
townsite
was
surveyed
,
plotted
out
and
dedicated
in
September
0000
.

Construction
began
in

0000
in
Pickens
County
,
Chickasaw
Nation
.

It
owes
much
of
its
existence
to
the
construction
of
the
Santa
Fe
Railroad
through
the
area
during
that
time
.

It
grew
,
as
most
frontier
towns
grew
,
over
the
years
into
a
trading
outpost
for
the
region
.

A
large
fire
in
0000
destroyed
much
of
the
fledgling
town
,
which
forced
residents
to
rebuild
nearly
the
entire
town
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
Ardmore
became
well
known
for
its
abundance
of
cotton-growing
fields
and
eventually
became
known
as
the
world
's
largest
inland
cotton
port
.

After
the
fields
were
stripped
of
their
fertility
,
however
,
the
city
found
itself
positioned
next
to
one
of
the
largest
oil
fields
ever
produced
in
Oklahoma
,
the
Healdton
Oil
Field
.

After
its
discovery
in
0000
,
entrepreneurs
and
wildcatters
flooded
the
area
,
and
Carter
County
quickly
became
the
largest
oil-producing
county
in
Oklahoma
,
and
has
remained
so
ever
since
.

Ardmore
has
remained
an
energy
center
for
the
region
ever
since
,
with
the
region
's
natural
wealth
giving
birth
to
such
energy
giants
as
Halliburton
and
the
Noble
Energy
companies
,
among
others
.

Ardmore
also
learned
the
perils
of
being
energy-rich
with
yet
another
disaster
in
0000
,
when
a
railroad
car
containing
casing
gas
exploded
,
killing
00
people
and
destroying
much
of
downtown
,
including
areas
rebuilt
after
the
0000
fire
.

The
disaster
,
which
made
national
news
at
the
time
,
gave
residents
the
resolve
to
establish
the
city
's
first
fire
department
to
ensure
that
such
events
would
not
recur
in
the
future
.

The
city
has
not
experienced
any
major
setbacks
since
the
0000
fire
,
save
a
0000
tornado
that
nearly
destroyed
the
Uniroyal
Goodrich
(
now
Michelin
)
Tire
Plant
in
west
Ardmore
.

Despite
a
shift
at
the
plant
working
at
the
time
,
miraculously
no
one
was
killed
as
the
tornado
ripped
through
the
area
,
due
to
the
public
being
alerted
by
area
news
and
tornado
sirens
.

On
April
00
,
0000
just
outside
of
Ardmore
was
the
site
of
the
worst
plane
crash
in
Oklahoma
history
,
when
an
aircraft
of
the
American
Flyers
Airline
crashed
and
killed
00
people
.

There
is
a
memorial
to
the
crash
just
outside
of
town
.

Ardmore
became
nationally
famous
in
0000
when
00
Democratic
members
of
the
Texas
House
of
Representatives
,
known
as
the
Killer
Ds
,
left
Texas
for
Ardmore
to
deny
the
Republican-controlled
House
a
quorum
when
Republicans
attempted
to
pass
a
redistricting
plan
for
U.S.
Congressional
Districts
.

Redistricting
of
Congressional
seats
is
traditionally
done
following
the
decennial
U.S.
Census
;
the
0000
plan
,
which
had
been
engineered
by
U.S.
Representative
Tom
DeLay
(
R-Texas
)
,
would
have
been
an
unprecedented
second
redistricting
in
the
same
decade
,
and
was
promoted
as
a
way
to
increase
Republican
electoral
success
.

By
leaving
the
state
to
stay
in
an
Oklahoma
hotel
,
Democrats
temporarily
delayed
passage
of
the
redistricting
plan
the
Republican-controlled
House
.

Republicans
eventually
succeeded
at
the
re-redistricting
,
although
in
0000
,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
ruled
that
new
borders
of
the
00th
Congressional
District
,
a
long
thin
chain
of
counties
from
Austin
,
Texas
to
Mexico
,
dubbed
the
'
Fajita
Strip
'
,
was
in
violation
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
of
0000
,
since
it
divided
up
predominantly
Hispanic
areas
into
multiple
districts
,
and
a
U.S.
District
Judge
ordered
new
boundaries
favorable
to
incumbent
Democrats
Ciro
Rodriguez
and
Lloyd
Doggett
to
be
drawn
.

Tahlequah
(
;
Cherokee

)
is
a
city
in
Cherokee
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
located
at
the
foothills
of
the
Ozark
Mountains
.

It
was
founded
as
a
capital
of
the
original
Cherokee
Nation
in
0000
to
welcome
those
Cherokee
forced
west
on
the
Trail
of
Tears
.

The
city
's
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
,
an
increase
of
0.00
percent
from
00,000
at
the

.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Cherokee
County
.

The
main
campus
of
Northeastern
State
University
is
located
in
the
city
.

Tahlequah
is
the
capital
of
the
two
federally
recognized
Cherokee
tribes
in
Oklahoma
,
the
United
Keetoowah
Band
of
Cherokee
Indians
and
the
modern
Cherokee
Nation
.

Origin
of
the
name
Many
linguists
believe
the
word
'
Tahlequah
'
(
Tah-le-quah
)
and
the
word
'
Teh-li-co
'
are
the
same
as
'
di
li
gwa
,
'
the
Cherokee
word
for
grain
or
rice
.

(
See
Cherokee
Nation
Lexicon
(
dikaneisdi
)
at
cherokee.org
under
culture/language
.

Scholars
report
the
Cherokee
word
'
di
li
gwa
'
describes
a
type
of
native
grain
with
a
red
hue
that
grew
in
the
flat
open
areas
of
east
Tennessee
.

One
particular
area
,
Great
Tellico
(
Tellico
Plains
,
Tennessee
)
,
was
named
for
the
grass
with
the
red
seed
tops
.

Others
interpret
a
word
'
tel-i-quah
'
as
'
plains
;
'
however
,
there
is
no
word
for
'
plains
'
in
the
Cherokee
lexicon
,
and
the
word
'
tel-i-quah
'
is
not
found
in
the
lexicon
.

The
idea
that
'
tahlequah
'
means
'
plains
'
lends
weight
to
the
belief
that
the
name
refers
to
the
wide
open
grassy
areas
of
Great
Tellico
.

When
the
Cherokee
first
arrived
in
the
Tahlequah
,
Oklahoma
area
,
they
saw
the
native
grasses
that
grew
in
the
open
areas
around
the
foothills
of
the
Ozarks
.

It
reminded
them
of
the
grassy
open
‘
Overhill
’
areas
of
Tellico
,
so
they
called
their
new
home
'
di
li
gwa
'
(
tah-le-quah
or
teh-li-co
)
,
the
open
place
where
the
grass
grows
.

Local
legend
states
the
name
is
derived
from
Cherokee
words
meaning
'
just
two
'
or
'
two
is
enough
.
'

Supposedly
three
tribal
elders
had
planned
to
meet
to
determine
the
location
of
the
Cherokee
Nation
's
permanent
capital
.

Two
elders
arrived
and
waited
for
the
third
.

As
dusk
approached
,
they
decided
that
'
two
is
enough
.
'

According
to
tribal
elders
and
Cherokee
County
elders
,
this
legend
first
began
to
circulate
in
the
0000s
.

Tahlequah
was
a
settlement
as
early
as
0000
and
the
Eastern
and
Western
Cherokees
joined
their
governments
at
Tahlequah
in
0000
.

Tahlequah
had
a
name
long
before
it
was
chosen
as
the
Cherokee
capital
.

Cherokee
Nation
capital
In
0000
,
Tahlequah
was
designated
the
capital
of
both
the
Cherokee
Nation
and
the
United
Keetoowah
Band
of
Cherokee
Indians
.

Initially
the
government
buildings
were
a
complex
of
log
or
framed
structures
.

Most
of
these
buildings
were
destroyed
during
the
Civil
War
,
which
divided
the
Cherokees
into
two
bitterly
opposing
sides
.

After
the
war
,
a
brick
capitol
was
built
and
first
occupied
in
0000
.

It
was
converted
into
the
Cherokee
County
courthouse
at
the
time
of
Oklahoma
statehood
in
0000
.

Several
markers
of
Cherokee
and
Native
American
heritage
can
be
found
in
town
:
street
signs
and
business
signs
appear
in
the
Cherokee
language
along
with
English
,
mostly
in
the
syllabary
created
by
Sequoyah
,
a
Cherokee
scholar
of
the
0000s
.

The
Cherokee
Supreme
Court
Building
,
located
in
downtown
Tahlequah
and
constructed
in

,
is
the
oldest
public
building

History
The
fort
was

southern
border
of
the
Indian
Territory
against

colonies
to
the
south
.

After

in
the
area
,
the
fort
was
revived
to
protect
Doaksville
,
a

.

It
became
the
economic
capital
of
the
Choctaw
Nation
.

county
seat
for
Choctaw

and
has
a
population
of
0,000
as
of
the
0000

The
city
serves
as
winter

for
some

.

It
is
adjacent
to
the
oldest
school
west
of
the
Mississippi
:
Goodland
Academy
,
begun
in
0000
.

The
town
is
located
in
a
cultural
area
of
the
state
known
as
Little
Dixie
,
as
it
was
settled
by
Native
American
tribes
,
African
Americans
and
European
Americans
from
the
Southeast
United
States
.

It
is
near
the
tourist
area
of
Kiamichi
Country
.

Hugo
is
the
starting
point
of
the
Indian
Nation
Turnpike
,
a
000-mile
four-laned
highway
which
runs
northeast
to
Interstate

in
Henryetta
,
providing
a
vital
transportation
link
from
southeastern
Oklahoma
to
the
state
's
largest
cities
,
Oklahoma
City
and
Tulsa
.

History
This
was
part
of
the
Indian
Territory
to
which
the
United
States
government
relocated
Native
American
tribes
from
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
in
the
0000s
under
its
Indian
Removal
policy
.

Among
the
nations
relocated
here
were
the
Choctaw
,
for
whom
the
county
is
named
.

They
were
one
of
what
were
called
the
"
Five
Civilized
Tribes
"
of
the
southeastern
United
States
,
as
they
had
adopted
numerous
elements
of
European-American
culture
.

When
they
relocated
,
they
brought
with
them
the
numerous
African-American
slaves
whom
they
held
.

As
the
Choctaw
allied
with
the
Confederate
South
during
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
United
States
government
insisted
on
a
new
peace
treaty
with
them
after
its
end
.

A
condition
was
the
Choctaws
'
emancipation
of
their
slaves
and
granting
to
the
freedmen
of
rights
of
full
citizenship
in
the
Choctaw
nation
,
as
the
US
was
granting
citizenship
to
former
slaves
of
the
South
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
a
number
of
Jewish
immigrants
,
fleeing
the
chaos
and
intensifying
anti-Semitism
of
the
waning
years
of
the
Czarist
Russian
Empire
,
settled
in
Hugo
.

They
generally
became
merchants
,
shopkeepers
and
peddlers
.

One
was
Abe
Romick
,
who
later
moved
to
Alaska
and
was
appointed
as
the
state
's
first
Secretary
of
Commerce
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
nearly
all
the
Jewish
Americans
had
left
Hugo
to
settle
in
larger
cities
such
as
Dallas
and
Fort
Worth
,
where
there
were
more
opportunities
.

By
the
0000s
,
no
ethnic
Jews
lived
in
Hugo
.

Present-day
townspeople
are
generally
not
aware
of
this
part
of
the
city
's
history
.

In
late
0000
,
the
town
suffered
several
violent
incidents
.

Before
Christmas
,
a
shootout
occurred
in
a
Wal-Mart
parking
lot
.

Within
one
week
in
December
,
two
fires
occurred
;
the
first
was
at
the
Booker
T.
Washington
gymnasium
on
December

.

On

a
fire
erupted
in
the
central
business
district
of
Hugo
,
consuming
five
buildings
and
burning
for
four
hours
.

The
Belmont
Hotel
,

historical

,
was
destroyed

"
Moore
"
-

a
board

History
On

,
0000
,
the
day
the
first
Oklahoma
"
Land
Run
"
opened
the
Unassigned
Lands
in
the
middle
of
Indian
Territory
to
settlers
,
JW
Klinglesmith
,
Albert
Rennie
and
several
other
businessmen
forded
the
South
Canadian
River
and
laid
claim
to
the
000-acre
town
site
that
was
to
become
Noble
,
Oklahoma
.

The
town
was
named
in
honor
of
Secretary
of
the
Interior
John
Noble
,
who
was
instrumental
in
opening
the
Unassigned
Lands
to
settlement
.

The
group
had
great
plans
for
Noble
,
hoping
it
would
become
the
future
county
seat
.

The
Santa
Fe
Railroad
completed
a
railroad
depot
in
Noble
in
August
0000
.

For

years
,
Noble
was
a
major
shipping
point
for
cattle
and
other
goods
from
both
sides
of
the
Canadian
River
.

Business
prospered
even
more
when
Charles
Edwin
Garee
built
a
new
suspension
toll
bridge
across
the
Canadian
River
in
0000
.

The
suspension
bridge
washed
out
in
0000
and
other
communities
began
developing
nearby
.

The
last
passenger
train
stopped
in
Noble
in
0000
and
the
depot
was
moved
.

Rose
Rock
Capital
of
the
World
Noble
is
considered
the
"
Rose
Rock
Capital
of
the
World
"
,
as
the
concentration
of
barium
sulfate
in
the
soil
is
higher
there
than
anywhere
else
,
causing
the
formation
of
rose
rocks
.

status
,
Noble
sets
aside
the
first
Saturday
each
May
to

its
annual
Rose

Festival

including
Norman
,
is
the
most
tornado-prone
area
in
the
United
States
.

In
addition
to
this
,
the
SPC
or
Storm
Prediction
Center
,
a
branch
of
the
National
Oceanic
and
Atmospheric
Administration
,
is
located
in
Norman
due
to
its
location
.

The
facility
is
used
for
forecasting
severe
storm
and
tornado
outbreaks
in
addition
to
housing
various
experimental
weather
radars
.

In
0000
,
CNN
/
Money
Magazine
ranked
Norman
as
the
sixth
best
small
city
within
the
United
States
to
live
in
,
the
highest
ranking
of
any
city
in
Oklahoma
.

History
The
Oklahoma
region
became
part
of
the
United
States
with
the
Louisiana
Purchase
in
0000
.
Prior
to
the
American
Civil
War
the
United
States
government
began
relocating
the
Five
Civilized
Tribes
-
the
five
Native
American
tribes
that
the
United
States
officially
recognized
via
treaty
-
to
Oklahoma
.
Treaties
of
0000
and
0000
assigned
the
area
known
today
as
Norman
to
the
Creek
Nation
.

Following
the
Civil
War
,
the
Creeks
were
accused
of
aiding
the
Confederate
States
of
America
and
as
a
result
they
ceded
the
region
back
to
the
United
States
in
0000
.

Shortly
after
this
the
Arbuckle
Trail
,
a
feeder
route
to
the
Chisholm
Trail
,
was
developed
to
hasten
the
transfer
of
cattle
from
Texas
to
the
railroads
in
Kansas
.
A
federal
survey
of
the
empty
lands
along
the
Arbuckle
Trail
was
undertaken
in
the
early
0000s
,
headed
by
00-year-old
Abner
Norman
.

Norman
’s
work
crew
set
up
camp
at
what
is
today
the
corner
of
Classen
and
Lindsey
streets
;
it
was
there
that
the
men
,
perhaps
jokingly
,
carved
a
sign
on
an
elm
tree
that
read
"
Norman
’s
Camp
,
"
in
honor
of
their
young
surveyor
.

In
0000
,
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
and
Santa
Fe
Railway
began
service
to
the
area
,
which
was
later
opened
to
settlement
as
part
of
the
Land
Run
of
April
0000
;
early
settlers
decided
to
keep
the
name
"
Norman
.
"

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
Land
Run
saw
the
founding
of
Norman
with
at
least
000
residents
spending
the
night
in
makeshift
campsites
;
by
the
next
morning
a
downtown
was
already
being
constructed
.

Almost
immediately
two
prominent
Norman
businessmen
,
former
Purcell
railroad
freight
agent
Delbert
Larsh
and
railroad
station
chief
cashier
Thomas
Waggoner
,
began
lobbying
for
the
territorial
government
to
locate
its
first
university
in
Norman
.

The
two
were
interested
in
growing
the
city
and
had
reasoned
that
rather
than
trying
to
influence
legislatures
to
locate
the
heavily
contested
territory
capitol
in
Norman
that
it
made
sense
to
attempt
to
secure
the
state
's
first
university
instead
(
a
move
that
would
be
far
less
controversial
)
.

On
December
00
,
0000
,
Larsh
and
Waggoner
were
successful
with
the
passage
of
Council
Bill
000
,
establishing
the
University
of
Oklahoma
in
Norman
approximately
00
years
before
Oklahoma
statehood
.

The
city
of
Norman
was
formally
incorporated
on
May
00
,
0000
.

The
city
has
continued
to
grow
throughout
the
decades
.

By
0000
the
downtown
district
contained
two
banks
,
two
hotels
,
and
a
flour
mill
,
and
other
businesses
;
by
0000
there
were
over
0,000
residents
living
in
Norman
when
the
Oklahoma
Railway
Company
decided
to
extend
its
interurban
streetcar
running
from
Oklahoma
City
to
Moore
into
Norman
,
spurring
additional
population
growth
.

The
rail
lines
eventually
transitioned
to
freight
during
the
0000s
as
the
United
States
Numbered
Highway
system
developed
.

The
city
population
reached
00,000
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
University
of
Oklahoma
and
Norman
city
officials
established
Max
Westheimer
Field
,
a
university
airstrip
,
and
then
leased
it
to
the
US
Navy
as
a
Naval
Flight
Training
Center
in
0000
.

The
training
center
was
used
for
training
combat
pilots
during
World
War
II
.

A
second
training
center
,
known
as
Naval
Air
Technical
Training
Center
,
and
a
naval
hospital
were
later
established
to
the
south
.

In
the
years
following
World
War
II
the
airstrip
was
transferred
back
to
the
university
's
control
.

Today
the
airstrip
is
called
the
University
of
Oklahoma
Westheimer
Airport
.

Following
the
war
the
remaining
military
presence
and
post-war
veterans
who
came
to
Norman
to
get
an
education
again
grew
the
city
's
population
,
which
was
00,000
by
0000
.

The
Navy
again
utilized
the
bases
in
a
lesser
capacity
from
0000
to
0000
in
support
of
the
Korean
War
effort
.

With
the
completion
of
Interstate
00
in
June
0000
,
Norman
found
its
role
as
a
bedroom
community
to
Oklahoma
City
increasing
rapidly
;
in
0000
Norman
's
population
was
00,000
but
by
the
end
of
the
decade
had
grown
to
00,000
.

Throughout
the
0000s
Norman
's
land
mass
increased
by
by
annexing
surrounding
areas
.

The
city
's
growth
trends
have
continued
early
in
the
00st
century
,
with
the
population
reaching
00,000
in
0000
and
000,000
in
0000
.

Law
and
government
A
council-manager
government
has
been
in
place
in
Norman
since
the
adoption
of
its
city
charter
on
June
00
,
0000
.

A
councilor
from
each
of
the
city
's
eight
council
wards
is
elected
to
office
every
two
years
,
each
serving
a
term
of
two
years
.

Councilors
are
elected
from
their
own
respective
wards
based
on
a
plurality
voting
system
;
a
councilor
from
each
ward
serves
on
the
Norman
City
Council
.

A
mayor
is
elected
by
the
entire
voting
population
of
Norman
and
serves
as
an
at-large
councilor
;
the
mayor
serves
for
a
term
of
three
years
.

As
a
whole
,
the
council
acts
as
the
legislative
body
of
city
government
;
it
aims
to
pass
laws
,
approve
the
city
budget
,
and
manage
efficiency
in
the
government
.

The
City
Council
appoints
a
professional
City
Manager
who
is
responsible
for
the
day-to-day
administrative
activities
of
the
city
.

The
City
of
Norman
has
approximately
000
employees
working
in
eleven
departments
and
00
boards
and
commissions
that
help
oversee
and
implement
the
policies
and
services
of
the
city
.

The
City
Council
meets
bi-weekly
in
City
Hall
located
at
000
W.
Gray
Street
in
downtown
Norman
;
various
boards
and
commissions
meet
in
accordance
with
their
own
schedules
.

The
present
mayor
of
Norman
is
Cindy
Rosenthal
(
elected
in
0000
)
,
and
the
city

Norman
,
all
city
elected
positions
are
nonpartisan
.

Municipal
and
state
laws
are
enforced
by
the
Norman
Police
Department
.

In
0000
,
Norman
's
crime
index
was
00
%
less
than
the
national
average
.

There
were
two
murders
,
00
rapes
,
00
robberies
,
00
assaults
,
and
000
burglaries
in
0000
.

Sister
cities
In
accordance
with
Sister
Cities
International
,
an
organization
that
began
under
President
Dwight
Eisenhower
in
0000
,
Norman
has
been
given
three
international
sister
cities
in
an
attempt
to
foster
cross-cultural
understanding
:

As
of
0000
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
is
land
and
is
water
.

Topography
Norman
and
the
surrounding
areas
are
mostly
flat
with
an
elevation
near
mean
sea
level
.

The
terrain
in
the
western
section
of
Norman
is
prairie
while
the
eastern
section
,
including
the
area
surrounding
Lake
Thunderbird
,
consists
of
some
of
lakes
and
Cross
Timbers
forest
.

The
lowest
point
within
city
limits
is
approximately
above
sea
level
(
located
at
00.00000
N
,
00.00000
W
)
.

The
highest
point
is
approximately
above
sea
level
(
located
at
00.00000

)
.

Climate
Norman
falls
within
a
temperate
,
humid
subtropical
climate
region
that
is
identified
as
"
cfa
"
class
on
the
Köppen
climate
classification
.

On
average
Norman
receives
about
of
precipitation
per
year
;
May
and
June
are
the
wettest
months
.

Temperatures
average
for
the
year
.

Average
daytime

.

Summers
can
be
extremely
hot
,
as
was
evident
in
0000
when
temperatures
climbed
above
for
more
than
a
month
.

Consistent
winds
,
averaging
near
and
usually
from
the
south
to
southeast
,
help
to
temper
hotter
weather
during
the
summer
and
intensify
cold
periods
during
the
winter
.

Norman
averages
a
growing
season
of
000
days
,
but
plants
that
can
withstand
short
periods
of
colder
temperatures
may
have
an
additional
three
to
six
weeks
.

Winter
months
tend
to
be
cloudier
than
summer
months
,
with
the
percentage
of
possible
sunshine
ranging
from
an
average
of
about
00
%
in
winter
to
nearly
00
%
in
summer
.

Norman
lies
within
Tornado
Alley
,
the
region
of
the
United
States
where
tornadic
activity
is

predominant
.

The
city
has
a
tornado
season
lasting
from
March
through
June
with
over
00
%
of
all
reported
tornadoes
occurring
during
these
months
.

The
Oklahoma
City
metropolitan
area
,
including
Norman
,
is
the
most
tornado-prone
area
in
the
United
States
.

As
recently
as
May
00
,
0000
,
a
tornado
outbreak
occurred
in
southeastern
Norman
that
resulted
in
the
loss
of
multiple
homes
and
businesses
.

Again
on
Friday
April

Drinking
water
controversyIn
a
study
published
in
0000
,
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
deemed
hexavalent
chromium
VI
(
chromium-0
)
to
be
a
likely
carcinogen
in
lab
animals
when
consumed
in
large
quantities
in
drinking
water
.

Prior
to
the
NIH
study
,
a
World
Health
Organization
study
found
that
chromium-0
was
a
likely
cause
of
lung
cancer
when
inhaled
by
humans
.

In
0000
,
test
results
released
from
a
California
non-profit
group
known
as
the
Environmental
Working
Group
showed
that
Norman
's
tap
water
has
a
chromium-0
concentration
level
of
00.00
parts
per
billion
(
ppb
)
,
which
was
the
highest
level
detected
among
00
US
cities
sampled
in
the
study
.

The
group
is
studying
chromium-0
levels
in
water
supplies
in
an
attempt
to
prove
a
causal
link
between
the
element
's
ingestion
and
cancer
in
humans
,
and
as
a
result
improve
the
country
's
water
standards
.

The
United
States
Environmental
Protection
Agency
does
not
currently
require
testing
for
or
set
limits
on
chromium-0
levels
in
American
cities
'
water
supplies
(
but
it
does
require
total
chromium-0
and
chromium-0
levels
not
exceed
000
ppb
)
.

The
EPA
has
recently
completed
studies
of
the
element
on
lab
animals
and
is
expected
to
make
a
determination
on
chromium-0
maximum
allowed
levels
in
June
0000
.

The
official
total
chromium-0
/
chromium-0
level
present
in
Norman
's
drinking
water
has
ranged
from
00
to
00
ppb
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
the
source
of
the
chromium-0
is
the
Garber-Wellington
Aquifer
,
which
is
known
to
have
elevated
levels
of
heavy
metals
.

The
issue
of
chromium-0
levels
gained
national
attention
with
the
0000
film
release
of
Erin
Brockovich
,
which
detailed
a
California
woman
's
legal
fight
against
Pacific
Gas
and
Electric
Company
for
allegedly
contaminating
her
hometown
with
excessive
levels
of
the
element
.

In
the
past
the
Norman
water
supply
has
also
been
criticized
for
the
presence
of
excessive
levels
of
arsenic
.

The
city
is
attempting
to
combat
this
problem
by
building
new
wells
and
removing
older
ones
.

History
Coalgate
originated
from
coal
mining
activity
and
was
the
site
of
a
mining
camp
.

The
majority
of
miners
were
migrant
workers
.

In
0000
the
son
of
an
Irish
immigrant
,
Patrick
Jay
Hurley
,
grew
up
struggling
as
a
miner
in
the
nearby
town
of
Lehigh
,
Ok
.

Hurley
befriended
an
Indian
boy
who
later
became
principal
chief
of
the
Choctaws
and
was
allowed
to
use
the
family
library
for
his
studies
.

At
age
00
Hurley
worked
as
a
ranch
hand
and
at
age
00
he
acquired
a
position
as
caretaker
at
Bacone
College
where
he
attended
night
classes
graduating
with
an
A.B.
in
0000
.

In
0000
Hurley
attained
a
law
degree
and
was
retained
as
a
lawyer
for
the
Choctaw
tribe
.

Hurley
practiced
law
before
the
U
S
Supreme
Court
from
0000-0000
.

With
profiteers
beckoning
,
Hurley
assisted
Choctaws
and
kept
their
wealth
in
Coal
mining
territory
.

Around
the
turn
of
the
century

Hoyt
.

Also
the

coal
mining
camps
had
been
,
"
A

History
The
land
that
is
present
day
Oklahoma
was
first
settled
by
prehistoric
American
Indians
including
the
Clovis
00000
BCE
,
Folsom
00000
BCE
and
Plainview
00000
BCE
cultures
.

Western
explorers
came
to
the
region
in
the
00th
century
with
Spanish
explorer
Francisco
Vásquez
de
Coronado
visiting
in
0000
.

Most
of
the
region
during
this
time
was
settled
by
the
Wichita
and
Caddo
people
.

Around
the
0000s
,
two
tribes
from
the
North
,
the
Comanches
and
Kiowas
,
migrated
to
the
Oklahoma
and
Texas
region
.

For
most
of
the
00th
century
,
the
Oklahoma
region
was
under
French
control
as
Louisiana
.

In
0000
,
the
Louisiana
Purchase
by
Thomas
Jefferson
brought
the
area
under
United
States
control
.

In
0000
,
Congress
passed
the
Indian
Removal
Act
,
which
removed
American
Indian
tribes
and
relocated
them
to
Indian
Territory
.

The
southern
part
of
the
territory
was
originally
assigned
to
the
Choctaw
and
Chickasaw
until
0000
when
the
Medicine
Lodge
Treaty
allotted
the
southwest
portion
of
the
Choctaw
and
Chickasaw
’s
lands
to
the
Comanche
,
Kiowa
,
and
Apache
tribes
.

Fort
Sill
was
established
in
0000
by
Major
General
Philip
Sheridan
who
was
leading
a
campaign
in
Indian
Territory
to
stop
raids
into
Texas
by
American
Indian
tribes
.

In
0000
,
the
Red
River
War
broke
out
in
the
region
when
the
Comanche
,
Kiowa
and
Southern
Cheyenne
left
their
Indian
Territory
reservation
.

Attrition
and
skirmishes
by
the
US
Army
finally
forced
the
return
of
the
tribes
back
to
Indian
Territory
in
June
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
United
States
Congress
appointed
a
commission
to
meet
with
the
tribal
leaders
and
come
to
an
agreement
allowing
white
settlement
.

Years
of
controversy
and
legal
maneuvering
ensued
before
President
William
McKinley
issued
a
proclamation
on
July
0
,
0000
,
that
gave
the
federal
government
control
over
of
surplus
Indian
land
.

Three
sites
in
Kiowa
,
Caddo
and
Comanche
Counties
were
selected
for
county
seats
with
Lawton
designated
as
the
Comanche
County
seat
.

The
town
was
named
for
Major
General
Henry
W.
Lawton
,
a
quartermaster
at
Fort
Sill
who
had
taken
part
in
the
pursuit
and
capture
of
Geronimo
.

The
city
was
opened
to
settlement
through
an
auction
of
town
lots
beginning
on
August
0
,
0000
,
which
was
completed
sixty
days
later
.

By
September
00
,
0000
the
Rock
Island
Railroad
expanded
to
Lawton
and
was
soon
joined
by
the
Frisco
Line
.

The
first
city
elections
were
held
October
00
,
0000
The
United
States
entry
into
World
War
I
accelerated
growth
at
Fort
Sill
and
Lawton
.

The
availability
of
of
water
from
Lake
Lawtonka
,
just
north
of
Fort
Sill
,
provided
the
motivation
for
the
War
Department
to
establish
a
major
cantonment
named
Camp
Doniphan
,
which
was
active
until
0000
.

Following
World
War
II
,
Lawton
enjoyed
steady
population
growth
with
the
population
increasing
from
00,000
to
00,000
from
0000
to
0000
.

By
the
0000s
,
it
had
reached
00,000
.

Lawton
underwent
tremendous
growth
during
the
late
0000s
and
0000s
,
leading
city
officials
to
seek
additional
water
sources
to
supplement
existing
water
from
Lake
Lawtonka
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
the
city
purchased
large
parcels
of
land
along
East
Cache
Creek
in
northern
Comanche
County
for
the
construction
of
a
man-made
lake
with
a
dam
built
in
0000
on
the
creek
just
north
of
U.S.
000
west
of
Elgin
.

Lake
Ellsworth
,
named
for
a
former
Lawton
mayor
and
soft-drink
bottler
C.R.
Ellsworth
,
was
dedicated
in
the
early
0000s
and
not
only
offered
additional
water
resources
,
but
also
recreational
opportunities
and
flood
control
along
Cache
Creek
.

In
0000
,
the
Lawton
City
Council
annexed
several
miles
of
land
on
the
city
's
east
,
northeast
,
west
and
northwest
borders
,
expanding
east
beyond
the
East
Cache
Creek
area
and
west
to
00nd
Street
.

On
March
0
,
0000
,
the
north
section
of
the
H.
E.
Bailey
Turnpike
was
completed
connecting
Lawton
directly
to
Oklahoma
City
.

The
south
section
of
the
turnpike
leading
to
the
Texas
border
was
completed
on
April
00
,
0000
.

Urban
renewal
efforts
in
the
0000s
transformed
downtown
Lawton
.

A
number
of
buildings
dating
back
to
the
city
's
founding
were
demolished
in
order
to
build
an
enclosed
shopping
mall
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
the
city
expanded
when
Lawton
annexed
neighboring
Fort
Sill
.

With
the
advent
of
the
Base
Realignment
and
Closure
of
0000
increasing
the
size
of
Fort

Medicine
Park
is
a
town
in
Comanche
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
,
situated
in
the
Wichita
Mountains
near
the
entrance
to
the
Wichita
Mountain
Wildlife
Refuge
.

Medicine
Park
has
a
long
history
as
a
vintage
cobblestone
resort
town
.

Medicine
Park
is
located
near
the
city
of
Lawton
and
Fort
Sill
.

It
is
an
exurb
,
part
of
the
Lawton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Many
of
the
original
structures
are
constructed
of
naturally
formed
cobblestones
—
these
red
granite
cobblestones
are
unique
to
the
Wichita
Mountains
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Medicine
Park
was
founded
on
July
0
,
0000
,
by
Elmer
Thomas
,
a
young
lawyer
who
had
just
become
a
member
of
the
Oklahoma
State
Senate
and
would
end
his
career
in
0000
as
a
U.S.
senator
.

In
the
spring
of
0000
,
five
years
after
the
establishment
of
the
Wichita
Mountains
National
Forest
,
Elmer
Thomas
envisioned
the
need
not
only
for
a
recreational
area
but
for
a
permanent
water
source
for
the
newly-founded
nearby
city
of
Lawton
.

Over
a
period
of
a
few
years
,
he
and
a
partner
,
Hal
Lloyd
from
Altus
,
Oklahoma
,
quietly
purchased
approximately
of
what
became
the
cobblestone
community
of
Medicine
Park
.

When
the
resort
first
opened
,
it
consisted
merely
of
a
large
surplus
Army
tent
with
a
wooden
floor
where
hot
meals
were
served
.

Two
dams
were
constructed
on
Medicine
Creek
to
form
Bath
Lake
Swimming
Hole
,
and
a
limited
number
of
campsites
were
constructed
.

Over
a
period
of
some
four
years
,
numerous
improvements
were
added
,
and
the
area
began
to
take
on
the
characteristics
of
a
bona
fide
resort
.

About
this
same
time
,
numerous
such
resorts
were
opening
near
the
entries
of
other
newly
founded
national
parks
and
national
forests
across
the
country
.

With
public
interest
growing
in
nature
,
the
automobile
gave
unprecedented
access
to
natural
wonders
.

Resorts
began
springing
up
nationwide
to
provide
food
,
lodging
,
and
entertainment
for
a
new
generation
of
tourists
.

Tourists
came
to
Medicine
Park
from
around
Oklahoma
and
North
Texas
.

Soon
,
there
were
two
inns
—
the
Outside
Inn
and
the
Apache
Inn
(
formerly
the
Press
Association
Clubhouse
)
--
Baird
’s
Health
Sanitarium
(

and

.

Bob
Wills
and
The
Texas
Playboys
(
the
kings
of
western
swing
)
became
regulars
at
the
Dance
Hall
from
0000
through
the
late
0000s
.

Soon
numerous
other
famous
bands
of
the
day
made
their
way
through
Medicine
Park
in
route
to
big
city
venues
in
Oklahoma
City
,
Dallas
,
and
Fort
Worth
.

The
entire
Bath
Lake
Park
was
landscaped
with
beautiful
gardens
,
large
trees
,
foot
bridges
,
and
grassy
areas
for
visitors
to
lounge
around
,
sunbathe
and
enjoy
the
natural
beauty
.

The
area
flourished
during
the
late
teens
to
the
0000s
as
the
“
Jewel
of
the
Southwest
.

”
The
nearby
Wichita
Mountains
Wildlife
Refuge
and
Lake
Lawtonka
attracted
thousands
of
people
each
weekend
and
throughout
the
seasons
.

Medicine
Park
became
the
“
playground
”
for
the
state
’s
rich
,
famous
and
notorious
.

Outlaws
and
horse
thieves
mixed
with
noted
politicians
and
businessmen
,
soldiers
and
officers
from
Fort
Sill
,
families
,
and
socialites
in
the
new

The
town
is
named
for
J.
Fiske
Devol
,
who
owned
the
land
on
which
it
stands
.

History
The
community
of
Devol
began
in
0000
,
when
the
Wichita
Falls
and
Northwestern
Railway
Company
laid
tracks
through
the
area
.

A
post
office
was
established
there
on
November
00
,
0000
.

The
railroad
became
a
subsidiary
of
the
Missouri
,
Kansas
and
Texas
Railroad
(
MK&T
or
Katy
)
in
0000
.

By
that
year
,
the
town
had
about
000
residents
.

Discovery
of
the
nearby
Burkburnett
Oil
Field
in
0000
initiated
a
brief
boom
in
Devol
.

At
least
two
refineries
were
built
in
the
area
,
along
with
several
oil
pipelines
.

The
0000
census
showed
the
population
was
0,000
.

The
town
had
the
first
dynamo
in
the
area
used
for
power
in
one
of
the
two
dance
halls
.

Devol
is
said
to
have
had
a
four
churches
,
lumber
store
,
feel
store
,
a
hotel
,
two
dance
halls/bars
,
a
brothel
and
000
’s
of
small
structures
to
rent
as
a
home
durning
the
growing
Burk
boom
.

However
,
the
boom
ended
in
0000
,
and
most
of
the
people
related
to
that
business
moved
away
.

The
town
bank
failed
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
population
of
Devol
was
only
000
.

The
0000
census
showed
000
residents
.

Legend
has
it
just
before
WW
II
the
oil
refineries
office
was
visited
by
the
local
KKK
in
full
dress
whites
and
demanded
the
program
manager
fire
all
caloric
’s
at
the
plant
in
support
of
the
pending
war
.

The
manager
was
said
to
reply
“
That
is
a
good
idea
!

one
I
had
not
thought
of
…
.

give
me
the
week
end
to
think
it
over
and
I
will
let
you
know
on
Monday
”
.

Monday
morning
the
group
returned
to
find
the
refinery
was
closed
and
the
gate
had
a
pad
lock
on
it
.

The
manager
had
moved
himself
and
his
family
out
of
town
on
the
Saturday
train
.

After
this
closure
the
population
was
said
to
have
dropped
by
0000
within
a
month
.

Devol
continued
to
shrink
after
World
War
II
.

Only
000
residents
remained
in
0000
.

The
high
school
closed
in
0000
,
and
in
0000
,
all
grades
were
consolidated
along
with
those
of
Randlett
and
Union
Valley
to
form
the
Big
Pasture
School
District
in
Randlett
.

In
0000
a
tornado
damaged
most
of
Devol
's
business
district
(
all
0
on
the
main
street
)
and
the
old
high
school
building
.

The
town
's
population
reached
000
,
the
lowest
recorded
in
its
history
.

The
MK&T
abandoned
its
tracks
in
0000
,
and
in
the
0000s
the
only
remaining
business
was
a
tack
shop
that
specialized
in
making
race
horse
saddles
.

But
closed
in
the
0000
's
.

Although
there
has
been
a
slight
rebound
in
population
,
no
business
are
now
in
Devol
and
the
post
office
has
been
threatened
with
closure
in
0000
and
0000
.

But
has
weathered
the
storm
for
00
years
so
far
as
of
this
posting
.

Note
:
Devol
never
had
a
police
force
except
the
KKK
.

They
were
the
enforcers
of
Friday
night
assaults
,
robberies
,
and
church
attendances
.

Also
the
”
Klan
band
”
would
play
in
the

center
gazebo
in

;

"
.

History
The
land
that
is
present-day
Oklahoma
was
first
settled
by
prehistoric
American
Indians
including
the
Clovis
00000
BCE
,
Folsom
00000
BCE
and
Plainview
00000
BCE
cultures
.

Western
explorers
came
to
the
region
in
the
00th
century
,
with
Spanish
explorer
Francisco
Vásquez
de
Coronado
visiting
in
0000
.

Most
of
the
region
during
this
time
was
settled
by
the
Wichita
and
Caddo
peoples
.

Around
the
0000s
,
two
tribes
from
the
North
,
the
Comanches
and
Kiowas
,
migrated
to
the
Oklahoma
and
Texas
region
.

For
most
of
the
00th
century
,
the
Oklahoma
region
was
under
French
control
as
part
of
Louisiana
.

In
0000
,
the
Louisiana
Purchase
by
Thomas
Jefferson
brought
the
area
under
United
States
control
.

In
0000
,
Congress
passed
the
Indian
Removal
Act
,
which
removed
American
Indian
tribes
and
relocated
them
to
Indian
Territory
.

The
southern
part
of
the
territory
was
originally
assigned
to
the
Choctaw
and
Chickasaw
,
until
the
0000
Medicine
Lodge
Treaty
allotted
the
southwest
portion
of
the
Choctaw
and
Chickasaw
’s
lands
to
the
Comanche
,
Kiowa
,
and
Apache
.

The
City
of
Walters
was
organized
on
August
0
,
0000
,
under
the
original
name
of
McKnight
,
Indian
Territory
.

Application
for
a
post
office
was
made
,
and
it
was
determined
that
a
town
in
Harmon
County
had
already
taken
the
name
of
McKnight
.

This
required
that
the
name
be
changed
.

The
name
of
Walters
was
chosen
,
in
honor
of
W.
R.
Walters
,
but
the
"
s
"
was
not
included
on
the
post
office
application
,
so
the
post
office
was
named
Walter
.

The
city
finally
grew
large
enough
to
meet
the
requirements
for
a
government
patent
,
and
one
was
granted
in
June
0000
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
an
election
was
held
to
form
a
new
County
(
Cotton
)
from
a
portion
of
Comanche
County
.

The
election
was
successful
and
Cotton
County
became
the
last
county
formed
in
Oklahoma
on
August
00
,
0000
.

Shortly
thereafter
,
another
election
was
held
to
determine
whether
Walters
or
Temple
would
become
the
county
seat
;
on
December
0
,
0000
,
Walters
won
by
000
votes
,
officially
becoming
the
seat
of
Cotton
County
.

The
names
of
Walter
and
Walters
were
used
interchangeably
and
confusingly
until
June
0000
,
when
an
application
was
made
to
Congress
to
officially
change
the
post
office
name
to
Walters
.

History
The
post
office
for
this
community
was
established
in
0000
and
originally
named
Posey
,
for
the
Creek
poet
Alexander
Posey
,
who
lived
in
Eufaula
,
Oklahoma
.

In
0000
,
the
town
was
moved
five
miles
southwest
and
renamed
Mounds
for
twin
hills
that
were
nearby
.

By
0000
,
the
St.
Louis
,
Oklahoma
and
Southern
Railway
(
later
the
St.
Louis
and
San
Francisco
Railway
)
built
a
track
through
Mounds
,
and
the
town
became
an
important
cattle
shipping
point
.

Mounds
incorporated
as
a
city
in
the
same
year
.

The
discovery
of
oil
in
the
Glenn
Pool
field
in
0000
turned
Mounds
into
a
shipping
point
for
crude
oil
instead
of
cattle
.

Mounds
had
a
population
of
000
at
statehood
in

oil
boom
played
out
in
the
0000s
,
and
the
population
declined
from
0,000
in
0000
to
000
in
0000
.

Railroad
activity
became
primarily
shipping
grain
and
cattle
.

As
time
went
by
,
the
population
reached
a
low
of
000
in
0000
.

Then
a
slow
increase

History
Early
History
The
town
was
named
after
Chief
Sapulpa
,
the
area
's
first
permanent
settler
,
who
was
a
full-blood
Lower
Creek
Indian
of
the
Kasihta
Tribe
from

,
Alabama
.

In

Polecat
and
Rock
creeks
(
about
one
mile
(
0.0
km
)
southeast
of
present-day
downtown
Sapulpa
)
.

When

known
as
the
Frisco
railroad
)
built
a
spur
to
this
area
in
0000
,
it
was
known
as
Sapulpa
Station
.

Controversy
over
Creek
County
Seat
location
After
Oklahoma
became
a
state
,
each
county
held
an
election
to
determine
the
location
of
the
county
seat
.

Sapulpa
competed
with
Bristow
,
Oklahoma
for
county
seat
of
Creek
County
.

After
five
years
of
contested
elections
and
court
suits
,
the
question
was
settled
by
the
Oklahoma
Supreme
Court
on
August
0
,
0000
.

Sapulpa
was
ruled
the
winner
.

The
county
courthouse
was
completed
in
0000
,
replacing
an
earlier
structure
built
in
0000
.

Economic
Development
The
area
around
Sapulpa
mainly
produced
walnuts
when
the
town
was
founded
.

In
0000
,
the
Sapulpa
Pressed
Brick
was
established
,
followed
in
a
few
years
by
the
Sapulpa
Brick
Company
.

This
began
the
clay
products
industry
.

The
Frisco
built
a
railyard
in
Sapulpa
and
by
0000
designated
Sapulpa
as
the
location
of
an
overhaul
base
for
its
rolling
stock
.

The
founding
of
Premium
Glass
Company
in
0000
marked
Sapulpa
's
entry
to
glass
manufacturing
.

Premium
Glass
was
absorbed
into
Liberty
Glass
Company
in
0000
.

Other
glass
producers
in
the

were
Bartlett-Collins
Glass
Company

Newspaper
controversy
The
Sapulpa
Daily
Herald
gained
national
media
attention
in

November
0000
for
not
reporting
the
election
of
Barack
Obama
as
President
,
reporting
only
that
John
McCain
had
won
among
the
voters
of
Creek
County
.

Critics
charged
that
the
omission
related
to
racism
,
as
Obama
's
victory
as
the
first
African
American
elected
president
was
an
historic
event
.

The
newspaper
maintains
that
it
only

Colcord
is
a
small
farming
town
in
southern
Delaware
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
community
lies
in
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state
in
a
region
known
as
Green
Country
.

At
the
0000
census
,
the
population
was
000
.

History
Colcord
's
history
starts
decades
before
the
establishment
of
the
town
itself
,
with
the
community
of
Row
,
Indian
Territory
,
in
the
0000s
.

As
settlers
moved
to
the
area
,
the
town
of
Row
grew
and
businesses
formed
,
including
a
bank
,
a
school
,
a
hotel
,
and
others
.

A
Post
Office
was
established
on
May
00
,
0000
.

In
the
0000s
,
a
road
(
later
known
as
Oklahoma
State
Highway
000
)
was
built
that
passed
south
of
the
then-healthy
town
of
Row
.

A
rural
mail
carrier
,
Charles
Burbage
,
who
owned
land
to
the
south
where
the
new
road
was
established
,
platted
into
blocks
,
lots
and
streets
.

The
area
grew
into
a
community
known
as
"
Little
Tulsa
"
to
locals
,
until
residents
changed
the
name
in
September
0000
to
"
Colcord
,
"
after
Charles
Francis
Colcord
.

Mr.
Colcord
was
a
successful
and
prominent
cattle
ranch
er
,
oil
businessman
,
and
early
Oklahoma
Territory
lawman
from
Oklahoma
City
,
who
owned
a
large
ranch
west
of
the
two
towns
.

The
ranch
employed
many
local
residents
,
and
was
very
important
to
the
economy
and
spirit
of
the
area
.

Due
to
better
transportation
and
a
disastrous
fire
that
wiped
out
many
Row
businesses
,
most
of
the
Row
community
eventually
moved
to
Colcord
.

The
Row
post
office
was
moved
to
Colcord
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
the
new
town
was
approved
to
build
a
high
school
.

A
feud
between
the
two
towns
ensued
,
and
in
the
first
eleven
years
of
Colcord
's
existence
,
the
school
was
involved
in
eleven
lawsuits
.

The
community
hosts
a
parade
called
"
Old
Settlers
Day
"
in
June
each
year
to
honor
its
heritage
and
the
many
people
that
settled
in
the
area
and
established
the
town
.

census
,
a

percent
.

Almost
00
%

thus
Jay
is
home
to
numerous
Cherokee
tribal
offices
and
a
health
clinic
for
the
Delaware
Disctict
of
the
Cherokee
Nation
.

The
city
is
celebrated
as
the
Huckleberry
Capital
of
the
World
and
has
been
host
to
the
annual
Huckleberry
Festival
each
July
0
weekend
for
since
0000
.

History
Jay
was
named
for
Jay
Washburn
,
a
nephew
of
Stand
Watie
and
grandson
of
an
early-day
Cherokee
missionary
.

The
town
is
the
county
seat
of
Delaware
County
,
having
won
that
distinction
from
Grove
,
Oklahoma
in
a
special
county
seat
election
on
December
0
,
0000
.

The
0000
–
00
Legislature
made
Grove
a
County
Court
Town
,
and
provided
for
two
court
terms
each
year
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
the
Supreme
Court
of
Oklahoma
ruled
in
favor
of
Jay
,
and
on
January
0
,
0000
,
the
County
Commissioners
ordered
the
records
to
be
moved
to
Jay
.

On
May
00
,
0000
the
courthouse
in
Jay
was
burned
,
destroying
most
of
the
county
records
.

The
post
office
was
established

.

Jay
incorporated

in

oak

forests
of

Ozark
Plateau
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

The
Cherokee
name
for
Jay
is
Dlaygvi
(
Bluejay
Place
)
.

Jay
is
atypical
in
Oklahoma
history
because
the
townsite
and
layout
were
located
and
platted
specifically
for
its
purpose
as
a
county
seat
.

It
is
not
located
on
a
river
,
major
road
or
railway
line
as
were
most
Oklahoma
towns
of
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
.

Around
0000
,
the
Delaware
County
Improvement
Association
hired
a
survey
team
to
pinpoint
the
exact
location
of
the
center
of
the
county
.

They
pinpointed
allotment
land
belonging
to
Thomas
Oochaleta
,
a
full-blood
Cherokee
.

Since
acquiring
title
to
a
full-blood
's
allotment
would
require
a
lengthy
federal
legal
procedure
,
the
committee
shifted
their
attention
to
the
allotment
adjoining
Oochaleta
's
on
the
east
,
a
parcel
belonging
to
committee
member
Claude
L.
"
Jay
"
Washbourne
.

As
a
mixed-blood
Cherokee
,
Washbourne
was
exempt
from
the
federal
policy
restricting
the
sale
or
transfer
of
his
land
.

He
gave
ten
acres
on
which
to
construct
a
town
.

The
town
was
designed
,
reserving
a
central
block
for
a
courthouse
.

The
committee
quickly
constructed
a
frame
building
and
then
applied
to
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
for
a
post
office
,
submitting
the
required
three
town
names
for
consideration
.

The
names
submitted
were
"
Center
,
"
"
Jay
,
"
and
"
Washbourne
.

Postal
authorities
chose
Jay
for

How
Kansas
got
its
name
Legend
has
it
that
a
man
of
small
stature
who
came
to
nearby
Siloam
Springs
,
Arkansas
,
by
train
from
Kansas
City
,
Kansas
,
rented
a
hack
and
stocked
it
with
light
household
goods
,
pots
and
pans
,
bolts
of
cloth
,
sewing
machine
parts
and
needles
,
etc.
.

He
drove
out
into
Indian
Territory
and
stopped
at
the
farm
homes
along
the
way
.

When
in
the
Kansas
area
,
he
always
camped
out
at
the
spring
on
Spring
Creek
just
under
the
hill
just
south
and
west
of
the
present
town
site
and
south
of
the
present
Scenic
U.S.
000
.

Because
the
Indians
in
the
area
could
not
pronounce
his
name
,
everybody
just
called
him
Little
Kansas
City
.

Thus
,
the
town
of
Kansas
was
named
for
this
unknown
,
but
well
remembered
man
.

He
may
have
been
the
first
merchant
in
what
is
now
Kansas
,
and
the
town
is
called
"
Little
Kansas
"
by
many
of
its
residents

Enid
(
ē
'
nĭd
)
is
a
city
in
Garfield
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

In
0000
,
the
population
was
00,000
,
making
it
the
ninth
largest
city
in
Oklahoma
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Garfield
County
.

Enid
was
founded
during
the
opening
of
the
Cherokee
Outlet
in
the
Land
Run
of
0000
,
and
is
named
after
Enid
,
a
character
in
Alfred
,
Lord
Tennyson
's
Idylls
of
the
King
.

In
0000
,
the
Oklahoma
state
legislature
designated
Enid
the
"
Purple
Martin
Capital
of
Oklahoma
.
"

Enid
holds
the
nickname
of
"
Queen
Wheat
City
"
and
"
Wheat
Capital
"
of
Oklahoma
and
the
United
States
for
its
immense
grain
storage
capacity
,
and
has
the
third
largest
grain
storage
capacity
in
the
world
.

History
In
summer
0000
,
M.A.
Low
,
a
Rock
Island
official
,
visited
the
local
railroad
station
then
under
construction
,
and
inquired
about
its
name
.

At
that
time
,
it
was
called
Skeleton
station
.

Disliking
the
original
name
,
he
renamed
the
station
Enid
after
a
character
in
Alfred
Lord
Tennyson
's
Idylls
of
the
King
.

However
,
a
more
fanciful
story
of
how
the
town
received
its
name
is
much
more
popular
.

According
to
that
tale
,
in
the
days
following
the
land
run
,
some
enterprising
settlers
decided
to
set
up
a
chuckwagon
and
cook
for
their
fellow
pioneers
,
hanging
a
sign
that
read
"
DINE
"
.

Some
other
,
more
free-spirited
settlers
,
turned
that
sign
backward
to
read
,
of
course
,
"
ENID
"
.

During
the
opening
of
the
Cherokee
Outlet
in
the
Land
Run
of
0000
,
Enid
was
the
location
of
a
land
office
which
is
now
preserved
in
its
Humphrey
Heritage
Village
,
part
of
the
Cherokee
Strip
Regional
Heritage
Center
.

Enid
,
the
rail
station
,
(
now
North
Enid
,
Oklahoma
)
was
the
original
town
site
endorsed
by
the
government
.

It
was
platted
by
the
surveyor
W.
D.
Twichell
,
then
of
Amarillo
,
Texas
.

The
Enid-Pond
Creek
Railroad
War
ensued
when
the
Department
of
the
Interior
moved
the
government
site
three
miles
(
0
km
)
south
of
the
station
prior
to
the
land
run
,
which
was
then
called
South
Enid
.

During
the
run
,
due
to
the
Rock
Island
's
refusal
to
stop
,
people
leaped
from
the
trains
to
stake
their
claim
in
the
government
endorsed
site
.

By
the
afternoon
of
the
run
,
Enid
's
population
was
estimated
at
00,000
people
located
in
the
Enid
's
town
plat
.

Enid
's
original
plat
in
0000
was
0
blocks
wide
by
00
blocks
long
consisting
of
the
town
square
on
the
northwest
end
,
West
Hill
(
Jefferson
)
school
on
the
south
west
end
,
Government
Springs
Park
in
the
middle
southern
section
,
and
East
Hill
(
Garfield
)
school
on
the
far
north
east
corner
.

A
year
later
,
the
population
was
estimated
at
0,000
,
growing
to
00,000
by
0000
,
the
year
of
Oklahoma
statehood
.

The
town
's
early
history
was
captured
in
Cherokee
Strip
:
A
Tale
of
an
Oklahoma
Boyhood
by
Pulitzer-winning
author
Marquis
James
,
who
recounts
his
boyhood
in
Enid
.

He
writes
of
the
early
town
:
Enid
experienced
a
"
golden
age
"
following
the
discovery
of
oil
in
the
region
in
the
0000s
and
continuing
until
World
War
II
.

Enid
's
economy
boomed
as
a
result
of
the
growing
oil
,
wheat
,
and
rail
industries
,
and
its
population
grew
steadily
throughout
the
early
00th
century
in
conjunction
with
a
period
of
substantial
architectural
development
and
land
expansion
.

Enid
's
downtown
saw
the
construction
of
several
buildings
including
the
Broadway
Tower
,
Garfield
County
Courthouse
,
and
Enid
Masonic
Temple
.

In
conjunction
with
the
oil
boom
,
oilmen
such
as
T.T.
Eason
,
H.H.
Champlin
,
and
Charles
E.
Knox
built
homes
in
the
area
.

Residential
additions
during
this
period
include
Kenwood
,
Waverley
,
Weatherly
,
East
Hill
,
Kinser
Heights
,
Buena
Vista
,
and
McKinley
.

Union
Equity
,
Continental
,
Pillsbury
,
General
Mills
,
and
other
grain
companies
operated
mills
and
grain
elevator
s
in
the
area
,
creating
what
is
now
the
Enid
Terminal
Grain
Elevators
Historic
District
,

the

Economy
When

,
Frank
Iddings
wrote
the
city
song
,
"
Enid
,
The
City
Beautiful
"
.
"

You
're
right
in
the
center
where
the
best
wheat
grows
and
you
've
got
your
share
of
the
oil
that
flows
,
"
his
lyrics
read
.

These

the
early
staples

boom
s
and
agricultural
growth
in
the
first
half
of
the
00th
century
.

The
Great
Depression
,
however
,
caused
both
of
these
staples
to
lose
value
,
and
many
businesses
in
Enid
closed
.

However
,
Enid
recovered
,
prospering
and
growing
in
population
until
a
second
wave
of
bad
economic
times
hit
in
the
0000s
,
when
competition
with
the
local
mall
and
economic
factors
lead
Enid
's
downtown
area
to
suffer
.

Since
0000
,
Enid
's
Main
Street
program
has
worked
to
refurbish
historic
buildings
,
boost
the
local
economy
,
and
initiate
local
events
such
as
first
Friday
concerts
and
holiday
celebrations

Elmore
City
is
a
town
in
Garvin
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
was
named
after
J.
O.
Elmore
.

History
The
first
business
in
Elmore
City
was
opened
by
Jasper
N.
Black
in
an
area
just
northeast
of
what
is
now
Elmore
City
.

Black
was
an
enterprising
man
who
knew
that
the
settlers
needed
a
place
to
buy
supplies
without
having
to
travel
to
the
east
to
what
would
become
Pauls
Valley
.

Historians
state
that
after
Black
opened
his
supply
store
in
0000
on
Rock
Creek
,
the
number
of
settlers
quickly
grew
and
a
community
was
formed
called
Banner
.

Banner
quickly
spread
to
the
southwest
and
a
post
office
was
established
and
the
name
changed
to
Elmore
for
J.
O.
Elmore
,
another
prominent
business
man
.

According
to
the
Gideon
Book
of
Historical
Places
,
the
word
city
was
added
to
Elmore
after
the
name
was
confused
with
Elmer
.

The
city
was
incorporated
as
a
community
in
0000
with
Black
serving
as
the
first
mayor
.

He
served
two
terms
.

Elmore
City
was
rapidly
developed
and
was
rated
as
the
best
inland
town
in
the
county
,
so
much
that
it
was
considered
along
with
Wynnewood
and
Pauls
Valley
for
the
county
seat
,
but
was
forced
to
drop
out
of
the
race
as
the
other
two
began
to
develop
.

Footloose
The
plot
of
the
0000
movie
,
Footloose
,
is
loosely
based
on
events
in
Elmore
City
since
dancing
was
banned
for
almost
000
years
in
this
city
.

This
ban
was
lifted
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
graduating
class
made
history
by
getting
permission
to
dance
at
the
prom
.

Various
citizens
were
featured
on
an
anniversary
edition
of
the
Footloose
DVD
,
recounting
the
events
that
led
to
the
change
in
city
code
that
allowed
students
at
Elmore
City
High
School
to
hold
their
first
prom
.

train
traveling
to
California

Paul
described
the
land
as
"
a
section
where
the
bottom
land
was
rich
and
blue
stem
grass
grew
so
high
that
a
man
on
horseback
was
almost
hidden
in
its
foliage
"

Minco
is
a
city
in
Grady
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
town
was
originally
included
in
the
Chickasaw
Nation
,
and
is
believed
to
be
named
after
the
great
Chickasaw
chief
and
warrior
,
Itawamba
Minco
,
who
later
acquired
the
name
of
Levi
Colbert
.

A
county
in
Mississippi
is
named
after
the
chief
who
resided
in
nearby
Monroe
county
near
Cotton
Gin
Port
.

Minco
was
originally
settled
sometime
around
0000
,
several
years
before
Oklahoma
achieved
statehood
.

In
its
early
stages
it
was
a
very
busy
town
because
of
its
location
at
the
end
of
the
Chicago
,
Rock
Island
&
Pacific
Railroad
Co.
until
the
railroad
was
extended
further
south
two
years
later
.

Charles
B.
Campbell
owned
the
occupancy
rights
of
the
land
that
the
town
was
built
on
.

His
wife
was
Miss
Maggie
(
Margaret
)
Williams
,
a
daughter
of
W.
G.
(
Caddo
Bill
)
Williams
,
owner
of
the
Half
Moon
Ranch
,
who
started
Silver
City
in
0000
by
building
a
trading
store
for
those
cattlemen
driving
their
herds
of
cattle
up
the
Chisholm
Trail
.

Before
the
establishment
of
Minco
as
a
town
three
major
expeditions
passed
through
the
area
.

The
first
expedition
was
conducted
by
Captain
Randolph
Marcy
in
0000
.

Marcy
was
ordered
to
escort
0000
individuals
headed
to
the
California
Gold
Fields
.

When
the
expedition
approached
the
Minco
area
they
kept
to
the
south
side
of
Buggy
Creek
,
which
Marcy
named
Deer
Creek
.

Marcy
named
his
route
the
Fort
Smith
to
Santa
Fe
Trail
.

Interestingly
enough
there
was
a
road
established
in
0000-0000
on
the
north
side
of
the
Canadian
River
that
was
also
named
the
Fort
Smith
to
Santa
Fe
Trail
.

This
road
had
been
laid
out
by
Josiah
Gregg
a
Santa
Fe
merchant
who
had
connections
with
merchants
in
Fort
Smith
,
Arkansas
.

During
the
summer
of
0000
the
first
railroad
survey
was
conducted
from
Fort
Smith
,
Arkansas
to
Los
Angeles
California
by
Lt.
Amiel
Weeks
Whipple
.

Whipple
's
Survey
basically
followed
Marcy
's
route
from
Fort
Smith
until
they
reached
the
Caddo
County
Buttes
.

At
that
point
the
expedition
moved
westward
while
Marcy
had
turned
north
to
join
the
Fort
Smith
to
Santa
Fe
Trail
not
far
north
of
Hydro
,
Oklahoma
.

Whipple
continued
westward
leaving
Oklahoma
just
west
of
the
Antelope
Hills
in
Rodger
Mills
County
.

The
Rock
Island
Railroad
Co.
's
original
purpose
in
extending
the
railroad
to
Minco
was
to
provide
a
gateway
for
the
shipping
of
cattle
from
the
grazing
lands
of
the
Chickasaw
Nation
,
just
to
the
south
of
the
town
.

On
August
0
,
0000
the
Chickasaw
Nation
's
land
was
opened
to
white
settlement
,
in
turn
making
Minco
a
railroad
hub
for
the
entire
region
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
local
citizens
formed
a
company
for
the
purpose
of
selling
vacant
lots
in
the
town
to
encourage
settlement
.

It
was
known
as
the
Minco
Townsite
and
Investment
Company
.

The
town
was
originally
composed
mainly
of
merchants
who
provided
supplies
for
the
many
travelers
that
used
the
railroad
infrastructure
of
the
town
.

It
is
the
oldest
town
in
the
Western
part
of
Oklahoma
so
its
many
businesses
served
residents
for
many
miles
around
.

In
fact
,
the
Hardware
Store
and
Tin
Shop
originally
opened
by
Kirk
Woodworth
in
0000
is
still
in
existence
in
the
town
.

The
remains
of
some
of
the
hotels
that
were
used
by
the
many
temporary
residents
also
still
stand
along
its
Main
Street
.

In
September
0000
Meta
Chestnutt
,
a
teacher
from
North
Carolina
determined
to
bring
education
to
the
frontier
(
specifically
Indians
)
,
along
with
the
services
of
J.H.
Bond
,
established
the
El
Meta
Bond
College
,
one
of
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
area
.

The
college
offered
elementary
,
grammar
,
and
high
school
courses
along
with
some
music
and
drama
courses
.

Having
faced
economic
troubles
for
the
whole
of
its
existence
it
was
eventually
decommissioned
in
0000
due
to
decreasing
enrollment
sine
the
arrival
of
newer
educational
institutions
that
came
with
statehood
.

After
the
demolition
of
the
old
school
building
a
modern
masonry
armory
was
constructed
in
0000
and
still
stands
today
and
serves
as
a
community
gathering
center
.

There
is
also
a
community
park
occupying
part
of
the
old
campus
.

In
this
park
there
is
a
plaque
commemorating
Meta
Chestnutt
and
her
contributions
to
the
school
.

The
Minco
Historical
Society
recently
established
a
museum
to

the
numerous
historical
facts
associated
with
the
town
.

Millennium
.

The
Minco
Millennium

in
Minco
.

The
Minco
Millennium
has
been
publishing
every
week
since
the
summer
of
0000
.

The

)
also

Controversy
In

gained
brief
notoriety
in

technical
circles

Jerry

Taylor
exchanged
emails
with

Johnny
Hughes
,
confused
that
a
misconfiguration
issue
at
the
webhost
provider
was
an
attempt
by
CentOS
to
"
hack
"
the
City

website
.

In
spite
of
attempts
by
Hughes
to
explain

this
publicity
"

threats

action
were
effective

“
After

,
he
called
me
Mr.
Taylor
,
”
he
said
,
“
And
he
got
me
the
information
I
needed
.

”
In
response
to
the
derision
he
had
received
from
the
Open

community
,
Taylor
stated
that
those
commenting
about
him
online
were
"
a
bunch
of
freaks
out
there
that
do
n’t
have
anything
better
to
do
...
[
CentOS
is
]
a

History
Before
people
of
European
descent
came
on
the
scene
,
the
region
around
the
present
town
of
Pond
Creek
was
traversed
by
many
of
the
nomadic
Native
Americans
of
the
Great
Plains
.

Although
the
land
is
now
heavily
agricultural
there
are
still
traces
of
campsites
along
the
numerous
creeks
of
the
drainage
of
the
Salt
Fork
of
the
Arkansas
River
.

When
many
of
the
Native
American
groups
were
moved
onto
reservations
in
what
is
now
Oklahoma
,
towns
and
trading
posts
were
established
.

Eventually
the
present-day
Oklahoma
was
divided
into
Oklahoma
Territory
and
Indian
Territory
.

The
history
of
Pond
Creek
and
the
surrounding
area
can
be
easily
confused
with
other
streams
called
Pond
Creek
(
see
e.g.
)
.

The
present
community
of
Pond
Creek
is
located
in
what
is
called
the
Cherokee
Strip
,
more
properly
known
as
the
Cherokee
Outlet
.

The
Cherokee
Outlet
,
more
often
referred
to
as
the
Cherokee
Strip
,
was
located
in
what
is
now
the
state
of
Oklahoma
,
in
the
United
States
.

It
was
a
sixty-mile
(
00
km
)
wide
strip
of
land
south
of
the
Oklahoma-Kansas
border
between
the
00th
and
000th
meridians
.

It
was
about
long
and
in
0000
contained
The
land
at
the
confluence
of
Osage
Creek
and
Pond
Creek
was
known
as
the
Pond
Creek
Stockade
on
the
original
Chisholm
Trail
used
by
cattle
drivers
bringing
herds
of
Texas
longhorns
north
to
the
railroad
head
first
at
Abilene
,
Kansas
then
later
to
Wichita
and
Caldwell
.

This
location
is
about
0
miles
north
of
the
present
town
of
Pond
Creek
near
the
present
village
of
Jefferson
.

Two
markers
have
been
placed
in
this
area
commemorating
the
untimely
demise
of
two
cowboys
.

There
are
two
granite
markers
placed
near
Pond
Creek
on
the
old
Chisholm
Trail
.

In
0000
,
the
Chicago
,
Kansas
and
Nebraska
Railway
built
a
branch
line
north-south
from
Caldwell
,
Kansas
to
Pond
Creek
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
it
was
incrementally
built
to
Fort
Worth
,
Texas
.

It
was
foreclosed
on
in
0000
and
taken
over
by
Chicago
,
Rock
Island
and
Pacific
Railway
,
which
shut-down
in
0000
and
reorganized
as
Oklahoma
,
Kansas
and
Texas
Railroad
,
merging
in
0000
with
Missouri
Pacific
Railroad
,
which
merged
in
0000
with
Union
Pacific
Railroad
.

Most
locals
still
refer
to
this
railroad
as
the
"
Rock
Island
"
.

Pond
Creek
was
settled
as
a
town
during
the
Cherokee
Strip
Land
Run
in
0000
:
"
The
government
townsite
of
Pond
Creek
was
first
entered
at
0:00
on
the
day
of
the
run
.

By
evening
,
it
contained
some
0,000
inhabitants
,
and
boasted
a
good
hotel
,
several
restaurants
,
a
dozen
law
offices
,
two
general
stores
and
six
or
seven
grocery
stores
.
"
"

The
government
had
previously
dug
at
least
one
well
on
each
of
the
government
townsites
,
but
Pond
Creek
's
well
was
soon
pumped
dry
,
and
an
emergency
well
,
dug
by
the
soldiers
,
struck
salt
water
.

Water
was
hauled
from
the
Salt
Fork
river
and
sold
for
five
cents
a
cup
,
but
it
was
not
suitable
for
animals
to
drink
,
not
to
consider
human
beings
.

Beer
sold
for
fifty
and
seventy-five
cents
a
bottle
,
although
it
had
not
been
iced
.

Horses
were
forced
to
drink
from
the
few
stagnant
creek
pools
that
could
be
located
.

And
to
add
to
the
misery
of
being
without
water
,
a
violent
sand
storm
swept
across
the
prairies
,
and
fires
raged
in
many
sections
.
"

In
addition
to
these
tribulations
,
the
citizens
of
Pond
Creek
had
to
do
battle
with
the
powerful
railroad
interests
,
in
this
case
the
"
Rock
Island
Line
"
or
CRI&P
railroad
,
to
get
a
coveted
depot
.

This
conflict
has
been
called
the
Enid-Pond
Creek
Railroad
War
.

Briefly
,
the
railroad
had
established
a
station
for
Pond
Creek
and
the
federal
government
established
a
different
station
about
0
miles
south
of
the
railroad
town
.

The
railroad
refused
to
stop
at
the
government
Pond
Creek
until
a
combination
of
citizen
action
and
congressional
action
forced
them
to
change
.

Pond
Creek
legend
has
it
that
the
railroad
specified
a
mail
stop
at
Pond
Creek
so
to
keep
face
they
merely
changed
the
name
of
railroad
Pond
Creek
to
Jefferson
and
made
government
Pond
Creek
the
Pond
Creek
station
.

This
story
does
n't
quite
correspond
with
most
personal
histories
of
the
controversy
but
it
makes
a
colorful
tale
.
