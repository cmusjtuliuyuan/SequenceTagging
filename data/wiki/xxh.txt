Sumpter
is
a
city
in
Baker
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

Sumpter
is
named
after
Fort
Sumter
by
its
founders
.

The
name
was
inspired
by
a
rock
as
smooth
and
round
as
a
canonball
,
which
reminded
a
local
resident
of
the
American
Civil
War
and
Fort
Sumter
.

Names
Baker
County
was
named
for
Edward
Dickinson
Baker
,
a
U.S.
Senator
from
Oregon
who
was
killed
in
the
Battle
of
Ball
's
Bluff
during
the
American
Civil
War
.

Sumpter
,
first
settled
by
Euro-Americans
during
this
war
,
was
named
after
Fort
Sumter
in
the
U.S.
state
of
South
Carolina
.

The
fort
was
often
mentioned
in
war
dispatches
read
by
the
settlers
.

An
account
in
the
Baker
Democrat
–
Herald
many
decades
later
reported
that
a
round
rock
found
in
the
area
in
the
early
0000s
had
looked
to
residents
like
a
cannonball
and
,
reinforced
by
the
war
news
,
had
reminded
them
of
Fort
Sumter
.

In
0000
,
Joseph
D.
Young
became
the
first
postmaster
of
Sumpter
,
and
,
according
to
his
grandson
,
was
not
allowed
by
the
U.S.
Post
Office
to
use
the
old
name
,
Sumter
.

Since
freight
to
the
region
then
depended
on
pack
mule
s
,
Young
chose
the
form
Sumpter
,
which
was
close
to
the
original
spelling
and
evoked
the
term
sumpter
mule
.

History
The
community
was
plat
ted
in
0000
,
becoming
a
mining
boom
town
about
00
years
later
.

Until
transportation
by
rail
became
feasible
in
the
area
,
Sumpter
was
little
more
than
"
a
huddle
of
crude
log
cabins
.
"

A
narrow
gauge
railway
reached
Sumpter
in
0000
.

Built
by
David
C.
Eccles
,
the
Sumpter
Valley
Railway
(
SVR
)
ran
from
Baker
City
through
Sumpter
and
on
to
Prairie
City
,
which
it
reached
in
0000
.

Until
the
line
shut
down
in
the
0000s
,
ranchers
,
mining
interests
,
and
timber
companies
used
it
to
move
freight
.

Shortly
after
the
SVR
arrived
,
the
city
expanded
near
a
set
of
deep-shaft
gold
mines
with
a
combined
total
of
of
tunnels
.

The
population
grew
to
more
than
0,000
.

Sumpter
had
electric
lights
,
churches
,
saloons
,
a
brewery
,
sidewalks
,
three
newspapers
,
and
an
opera
house
.

However
,
as
the
mines
played
out
,
the
city
declined
even
before
a
devastating
fire
in
0000
.

Dynamite
was
used
to
help
put
out
the
fire
,
which
destroyed
00
blocks
of
the
town
's
buildings
.

A
few
of
the
surviving
structures
remain
in
the
00st
century
and
are
occupied
by
retail
shops
.

Economy
Sumpter
relies
heavily
on
tourism
as
a
source
of
income
.

The
town
's
remaining
historic
structures
,
an
excursion
train
that
runs
along
part
of
the
SVR
line
,
and
a
state
park
devoted
to
an
historic
gold
dredge
make
the
city
a
tourist
destination
.

A
stretch
of
the
original
SVR
has
been
restored
and
operates
on
summer
weekends
and
major
holidays
from
Memorial
Day
through
the
end
of
September
.

The
excursion
line
has
stations
in
Sumpter
and
McEwen
.

The
Sumpter
station
and
part
of
the
line
are
within
the
state
park
,
known
as
the
Sumpter
Valley
Dredge
State
Historic
Area
.

The
dredge
on
display
in
the
park
was
the
last
of
three
used
to
mine
gold
from
surface
deposits
along
the
Powder
River
.

It
operated
here
from
0000
through
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
area
was
the
location
for
the
reality
television
show
Ghost
Mine
.

The
plot
involves
a
team
of
people
looking
for
gold
and
ghosts
in
the
"
Crescent
Mine
"
near
Sumpter
.

According
to
a
Baker
City
Herald
story
picked
up
by
the
Associated
Press
and
Portland
television
station
KATU
,
most
of
the
filming
was
done
at
the
Buckeye
Mine
group
near
Bourne
,
about
north
of
Sumpter
along
Cracker
Creek
.

Estacada
(
)
is
a
city
in
Clackamas
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
,
about
00
miles
southeast
of
Portland
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
Estacada
post
office
opened
in
February
0000
and
the
city
was
incorporated
in
May
0000
.

The
community
formed
as
a
camp
for
workers
building
a
hydroelectric
dam
on
the
nearby
Clackamas
River
that
was
to
supply
Portland
with
electricity
.

At
the
time
,
the
river
was
relatively
inaccessible
by
road
,
forcing
the
Oregon
Power
Railway
Company
to
build
a
railway
to
the
vicinity
of
the
river
to
transport
crews
to
the
river
for
the
construction
of
the
dam
.

After
the
construction
of
the
Hotel
Estacada
,
the
town
became
a
weekend
destination
on
the
railroad
line
for
residents
of
Portland
.

During
the
week
,
the
train
carried
freight
and
work
crews
to
and
from
Portland
.

Following
the
development
of
the
dams
,
the
city
became
a
hub
for
the
logging
industry
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
a
trolley
line
connected
the
town
with
downtown
Portland
.

The
railway
line
has
been
removed
and
there
is
no
longer
rail
service
to
Estacada
.

Name
The
origin
of
the
city
's
name
is
disputed
.

One
explanation
is
that
the
city
's
name
is
a
corruption
of
the
name
of
a
local
resident
,
Esther
Katie
.

There
is
no
evidence
that
she
existed
.

The
more
prosaic
explanation
is
that
someone
with
knowledge
of
the
Llano
Estacado
region
of
modern-day
Texas
threw
the
name
in
a
hat
and
it
won
,
but
somehow
the
final
o
became
an
a.
Another
theory
states
that
:
Geography
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
,
is
land
and
is
water
.

Outside
the
city
limits
the
land
is
mainly
farmland
,
extending
from
the
Springwater
area
to
the
south
,
Eagle
Creek
to
the
west
,
and
the
Mount
Hood
National
Forest
to
the
north
and
east
.

Hydro
projects
The
Clackamas
River
flows
by
the
city
,
which
drains
into
the
Willamette
River
,
thence
the
Columbia
.

There
are
four
dams
on
the
Clackamas
River
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
Estacada
:
River
Mill
Dam
,
Faraday
Dam
(
a
diversionary
dam
)
,
Cazadero
Dam
,
and
North
Fork
Dam
.

Harriet
Dam
is
further
upstream
.

The
original
Cazadero
Dam
was
destroyed
by
the
Christmas
flood
of
0000
and
reconstructed
as
Faraday
Dam
;
the
current
Cazadero
Dam
is
between
Faraday
and
North
Fork
,
The
dams
are
currently
operated
by
Portland
General
Electric
.

a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
within

Hood
Corridor
in
Clackamas
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
CDP
had
a
total
population
of
0,000
.

The
Villages
at
Mount
Hood
is
the
name
of
the
combined
government
of
several
of
the
communities
encompassed
by
the
CDP
and

a
separate
entity
.

Government
The
Villages
at
Mount
Hood
is
the
common
government
of
the
unincorporated
communities
of
the
Mount
Hood
Corridor
,
and
includes
Brightwood
,
Welches
,
Wemme
,

.

Residents

0000
.

The
Villages
at
Mount
Hood
was
the
first
established
village
under
Clackamas
County
's
"
Complete
Communities
"
ordinance
,
which
allows
unincorporated
communities
to
form
quasi-governments
that
allow
them
to
have
more
direct
control
regarding
the
issues
and
activities
that
affect
them
.

According
to
the
village
's
official
Web
site
,
the
communities
united
to
form
the
village
because
the
Oregon
Department
of
Transportation
required
that
the
towns
create
a
"
governmental
agency
"
in
order
to
continue
getting
grants
for
the
growing
Mountain
Express
Bus
system
.

The
"
Complete
Communities
"
ordinance
makes
villages
and
hamlets
official
agencies
of
the
county
.

W.
Cornell
,
a
member
of
the
surveying
party
that
plat
ted
the
townsite
in
the
0000s
.

The
company
that
was
developing
the
property
had
not
been
able
to
come
up
with
a
good
name
for
the
place
and
Cornell
suggested
Oak
Grove
after
a
crew
ate
lunch
in
a
stand
of
oak
trees
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
tract
.

The

Grove
railroad
station

Office
Department
changed
the
name
of
the
post
office
to
Oak
Grove
,
and
the
Center
railroad
station
was
renamed
to
match
.

The
railroad
no

West
Linn
is
a
city
in
Clackamas
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

Now
a
southern
suburb
within
the
Portland
metropolitan
area
,
West
Linn
has
a
history
of
early
development
,
prompted
by
the
opportunity
to
harvest
energy
from
nearby
Willamette
Falls
.

It
was
named
after
U.S.
Senator
Lewis
F.
Linn
of
Ste.
Genevieve
,
Missouri
,
who
had
advocated
the
American
occupation
of
Oregon
as
a
counterclaim
to
the
British
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
had
a
population
of
00,000
.

History
Prior
to
settlement
by
Oregon
pioneers
,
the
area
which
became
known
as
West
Linn
was
the
home
of
ancestors
of
some
of
the
present-day
Confederated
Tribes
of
the
Grand
Ronde
Community
of
Oregon
.

00th
century
Major
Robert
Moore
was
an
early
settler
arriving
in
0000
—
before
the
Champoeg
Meetings
—
having
been
the
senior
member
of
the
first
attempt
to
create
an
American
state
in
Oregon
,
the
Peoria
Party
.

Sometime
after
journeying
around
the
Willamette
Valley
and
Columbia
Basin
,
Moore
bought
title
to
approx
.

on
the
west
side
of
Willamette
Falls
,
across
the
Willamette
River
from
Oregon
City
,
from
a
local
Native
American
chief
,
on
which
he
platted
a
town
he
called
"
Robin
's
Nest
"
in
early
0000
.

He
also
filed
a
provisional
claim
with
the
then
government
of
the
Oregon
Country
,
not
knowing
if
his
transaction
would
be
honored
by
the
eventual
governing
laws
.

The
Oregon
Territorial
Legislature
voted
to
rename
it
Linn
City
on
December
00
,
0000
as
a
memorial
to
Senator
Lewis
F.
Linn
after
whom
Linn
County
is
also
named
.

Linn
was
a
neighbor
and
family
friend
of
the
Moores
from
their
time
as
settlers
in
the
early
Missouri
Territory
.

For
many
years
Linn
City
was
a
political
and
commercial
rival
to
the
adjacent
town
of
Oregon
City
,
but
it
suffered
a
series
of
natural
and
man-made
setbacks
.

A
major
fire
and
the
Great
Flood
of
0000
put
a
halt
to
the
pioneer
settlement
in
0000
,
dispersing
many
of
the
surviving
family
members
throughout
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

00th
century
West
Linn
was
incorporated
in
0000
and
merged
with
the
adjacent
town
of
Willamette
in
0000
,
which
had
incorporated
five
years
earlier
.

When
the
City
of
West
Linn
incorporated
in
0000
,
it
encompassed
West
Oregon
City
,
Bolton
,
Sunset
and
Willamette
Heights
.

The
incorporation
allowed
the
settlements
to
obtain
needed
services
,
utilities
,
and
improvements
without
annexing
to
Oregon
City
.

After
considerable
debate
on
a
name
,
the
city
founders
decided
to
honor
the
pioneer
town
that
Moore
had
established
.

The
city
's
population
historically
grew
steadily
,
but
in
recent
years
has
leveled
off
.

The
0000
census
listed
000
residents
.

By
0000
,
the
number
had
grown
to
0,000
.

The
0000
census
set
the
population
at
0,000
,
and
by
0000
,
West
Linn
had
grown
to
more
than
0,000
.

The
city
’s
population
has
continued
to
grow
each
year
.

Currently
,
the
city
’s
population
is
00,000
.

Cannon
Beach
is
a
city
in
Clatsop
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
first
recorded
journey
by
a
European
to
what
is
now
Cannon
Beach
was
made
by
William
Clark
,
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
Lewis
and
Clark
Expedition
in
early
0000
.

The
expedition
was
wintering
at
Fort
Clatsop
,
roughly
00
miles
to
the
north
near
the
mouth
of
the
Columbia
River
.

In
December
0000
,
two
members
of
the
expedition
returned
to
camp
with
blubber
from
a
whale
that
had
beached
several
miles
south
,
near
the
mouth
of
Ecola
Creek
.

Clark
later
explored
the
region
himself
.

From
a
spot
near
the
western
cliffs
of
the
headland
he
saw
"
...
the
grandest
and
most
pleasing
prospects
which
my
eyes
ever
surveyed
,
in
front
of
a
boundless
Ocean
...
"
That
viewpoint
,
later
dubbed
"
Clark
's
Point
of
View
,
"
can
be
accessed
by
a
hiking
trail
from
Indian
Beach
in
Ecola
State
Park
.

Clark
and
several
of
his
companions
,
including
Sacagawea
,
completed
a
three
day
journey
on
January
00
,
0000
to
the
site
of
the
beached
whale
.

They
encountered
a
group
of
Native
Americans
from
the
Tillamook
tribe
who
were
boiling
blubber
for
storage
.

Clark
and
his
party
met
with
them
and
successfully
bartered
for
of
blubber
and
some
whale
oil
before
returning
to
Fort
Clatsop
.

There
is
wooden
whale
sculpture
commemorating
the
encounter
between
Clark
's
group
and
the
Tillamooks
in
a
small
park
at
the
northern
end
of
Hemlock
Street
.

Clark
applied
the
name
"
Ekoli
"
to
what
is
now
Ecola
Creek
.

Ehkoli
is
a
Chinook
word
for
"
whale
"
.

Early
settlers
later
renamed
the
creek
"
Elk
Creek
"
,
and
a
community
with
the
same
name
formed
nearby
.

In
0000
,
a
cannon
from
the
US
Navy
schooner
Shark
washed
ashore
just
north
of
Arch
Cape
,
a
few
miles
to
the
south
of
the
community
.

The
schooner
hit
land
while
attempting
to
cross
the
Columbia
Bar
,
also
known
as
the
"
Graveyard
of
the
Pacific
.
"

The
cannon
,
rediscovered
in
0000
,
eventually
inspired
a
name
change
for
the
growing
community
.

In
0000
,
Elk
Creek
was
redubbed
Cannon
Beach
(
after
the
name
of
the
beach
that
extends
south
of
Ecola
creek
for
eight
miles
,
ending
at
Arch
Cape
)
at
the
insistence
of
the
Post
Office
Department
because
the
name
was
frequently
confused
with
Eola
.

Elk
Creek
itself
was
renamed
Ecola
Creek
to
honor
William
Clark
's
original
name
.

The
cannon
is
now
housed
in
the
city
's
museum
and
a
replica
of
it
can
be
seen
alongside
U.S.
Highway
000
.

Two
more
cannons
,
also
believed
to
have
been
from
the
Shark
,
were
discovered
on
Arch
Cape
over
the
weekend
of
February
00
,
0000
.

U.S.
Highway
000
formerly
ran
through
Cannon
Beach
.

In
0000
,
a
tsunami
generated
by
the
Good
Friday
Earthquake
came
ashore
along
the
coast
of
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

The
subsequent
flooding
inundated
parts
of
Cannon
Beach
and
washed
away
the
highway
bridge
located
on
the
north
side
of
city
.

The
city
,
now
isolated
from
the
highway
,
decided
to
attract
visitors
by
holding
a
sand
castle
contest-an
event
that
still
continues
annually
every
June
.

Dumfries
(
;
possibly
from
)
is
a
market
town
and
former
royal
burgh
within
the
Dumfries
and
Galloway
council
area
of
Scotland
.

It
is
near
the
mouth
of
the
River
Nith
into
the
Solway
Firth
.

Dumfries
was
the
county
town
of

Etymology
There
are
at
least
two
theories
on
the
etymology
of
the
name
.

One
is
that
the
name
Dumfries
originates
from
the
Scottish
Gaelic
name
Dún
Phris
which
means
"
Fort
of
the
Thicket
"
.

According
to
another
theory
,
the
name
is
a
corruption
of
two
words
which
mean
the
Friars
’
Hill
;
those
who
favour
this
idea
allege
the
formation
of
a
religious
house
near
the
head
of
what
is
now
the
Friars
’
Vennel
.

History
Early
history
No
positive
information
has
been
obtained
of
the
era
and
circumstances
in
which
the
town
of
Dumfries
was
founded
.

Some
writers
hold
that
Dumfries
flourished
as
a
place
of
distinction
during
the
Roman
occupation
of
North
Great
Britain
.

The
Selgovae
inhabited
Nithsdale
at
the
time
and
may
have
raised
some
military
works
of
a
defensive
nature
on
or
near
the
site
of
Dumfries
;
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
a
castle
of
some
kind
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
town
.

This
is
inferred
from
the
etymology
of
the
name
,
which
,
according
to
one
theory
,
is
resolvable
into
two
Gaelic
terms
signifying
a
castle
or
fort
in
the
copse
or
brushwood
.

A
more
likely
explanation
though
is
Dun
(
Scottish
Gaelic
for
fortress
and
Fries
,
Frisians
.

Dumfries
i.e.
Fortress
of
the
Frisians
.

Dumfries
was
once
within
the
borders
of
the
Kingdom
of
Northumbria
.

The
district
around
Dumfries
was
for
several
centuries
ruled
over
and
deemed
of
much
importance
by
the
invading
Romans
.

Many
traces
of
Roman
presence
in
Dumfriesshire
are
still
to
be
found
;
coins
,
weapons
,
sepulchral
remains
,
military
earthworks
,
and
roads
being
among
the
relics
left
by
their
lengthened
sojourn
in
this
part
of
Scotland
.

The
apostle
Paul
claimed
rank
and
privilege
as
a
Roman
citizen
on
account
of
his
birth
at
Tarsus
;
the
Caledonian
tribes
in
the
south
of
Scotland
were
invested
with
the
same
rights
by
an
edict
of
Antoninus
Pius
.

The
Romanized
natives
received
freedom
(
the
burrows
,
cairns
,
and
remains
of
stone
temples
still
to
be
seen
in
the
district
tell
of
a
time
when
Druidism
was
the
prevailing
religion
)
as
well
as
civilisation
from
their
conquerors
.

Late
in
the
fourth
century
,
the
Romans
took
farewell
of
the
country
.

According
to
another
theory
,
the
name
is
a
corruption
of
two
words
which
mean
the
Friars
’
Hill
;
those
who
favour
this
idea
allege
that
St.
Ninian
,
by
planting
a
religious
house
near
the
head
of
what
is
now
the
Friars
’
Vennel
,
at
the
close
of
the
fourth
century
,
became
the
virtual
founder
of
the
Burgh
;
however
Ninian
,
so
far
as
is
known
,
did
not
originate
any
monastic
establishments
anywhere
and
was
simply
a
missionary
.

In
the
list
of
British
towns
given
by
the
ancient
historian
Nennius
,
the
name
Caer
Peris
occurs
,
which
some
modern
antiquarians
suppose
to
have
been
transmuted
,
by
a
change
of
dialect
,
into
Dumfries
.

Twelve
of
King
Arthur
's
battles
were
recorded
by
Nennius
in
Historia
Brittonum
.

The
Battle
of
Tribruit
(
the
00th
battle
)
,
has
been
suggested
as
having
possibly
been
near
Dumfries
or
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
Avon
near
Bo
'
ness
.

After
the
Roman
departure
the
area
around
Dumfries
had
various
forms
of
visit
by
Picts
,
Saxons
,
Scots
and
Danes
culminating
in
a
decisive
victory
for
Gregory
,
King
of
Scots
at
what
is
now
Lochmaben
over
the
native
Britons
in
000
.

Medieval
period
When
,
in
0000
,
Malcolm
Canmore
and
William
the
Conqueror
held
a
conference
regarding
the
claims
of
Edgar
Atheling
to
the
English
Crown
,
they
met
at
Abernithi
–
a
term
which
in
the
old
British
tongue
means
a
port
at
the
mouth
of
the
Nith
.

It
has
been
argued
,
the
town
thus
characterised
must
have
been
Dumfries
;
and
therefore
it
must
have
existed
as
a
port
in
the
Kingdom
of
Strathclyde
,
if
not
in
the
Roman
days
.

However
,
against
this
argument
is
that
the
town
is
situated
eight
to
nine
miles
(
00
km
)
distant
from
the
sea
,
although
the
River
Nith
is
tidal
and
navigable
all
the
way
into
the
town
itself
.

Although
at
the
time
a
mile
upstream
and
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
Nith
from
Dumfries
,
Lincluden
Abbey
was
founded
circa
0000
.

The
abbey
ruins
are
on
the
site
of
the
Bailey
of
the
very
early
Lincluden
Castle
,
as
are
those
of
the
later
Lincluden
Tower
.

This
religious
house
was
used
for
various
purposes
,
until
its
abandonment
around
0000
.

Lincluden
Abbey
and
its
grounds
are
now
within
the
Dumfries
urban
conurbation
boundary
.

William
the
Lion
granted
the
charter
to
raise
Dumfries
to
the
rank
of
a
Royal
Burgh
in
0000
.

Dumfries
was
very
much
on
the
frontier
during
its
first
00
years
as
a
burgh
and
it
grew
rapidly
as
a
market
town
and
port
.

Alexander
III
visited
Dumfries
in
0000
to
plan
an
expedition
against
the
Isle
of
Man
,
previously
Scots
but
for
000
years
subjected
by
the
crown
of
Norway
.

Identified
with
the
conquest
of
Man
,
Dumfries
shared
in
the
well
being
of
Scotland
for
the
next
00
years
until
Alexander
's
accidental
death
brought
an
Augustan
era
in
the
town
's
history
to
an
abrupt
finish
.

A
royal
castle
,
which
no
longer
exists
,
was
built
in
the
00th
century
on
the
site
of
the
present
Castledykes
Park
.

In
the
latter
part
of
the
century
William
Wallace
chased
a
fleeing
English
force
southward
through
the
Nith
valley
.

The
English
fugitives
met
the
gates
of
Dumfries
Castle
that
remained
firmly
closed
in
their
presence
.

With
a
body
of
the
town
's
people
joining
Wallace
and
his
fellow
pursuers
when
they
arrived
,
the
fleeing
English
met
their
end
at
Cockpool
on
the
Solway
Coast
.

After
resting
at
Caerlaverock
Castle
a
few
miles
away
from
the
bloodletting
,
Wallace
again
passed
through
Dumfries
the
day
after
as
he
returned
north
to
Sanquhar
.

In
the
invasion
of
0000
,
Edward
I
lodged
for
a
few
days
in
June
with
the
Minorite
Friars
of
the
Vennel
,
before
at
the
head
of
the
then
greatest
invasion
force
to
attack
Scotland
he
laid
siege
to
Caerlaverock
Castle
.

After
Caerlaverock
eventually
succumbed
,
Edward
passed
through
Dumfries
again
as
he
crossed
the
Nith
to
take
his
invasion
into
Galloway
.

With
the
Scottish
nobility
having
requested
Vatican
support
of
their
cause
,
Edward
on
his
return
to
Caerlaverock
was
presented
with
a
missive
directed
to
him
by
Pope
Boniface
VII
.

Edward
held
court
in
Dumfries
at
which
he
grudgingly
agreed
to
an
armistice
.

On
00
October
,
the
truce
solicited
by
Pope
Boniface
was
signed
by
Edward
at
Dumfries
.

Letters
from
Edward
,
dated
at
Dumfries
,
were
sent
to
his
subordinates
throughout
Scotland
,
ordering
them
to
give
effect
to
the
treaty
.

The
peace
was
to
last
till
Whitsunday
in
the
following
year
.

Before
becoming
King
of
Scots
,
Robert
the
Bruce
slew
his
rival
the
Red
Comyn
at
Greyfriars
Kirk
in
the
town
on
00
February
0000
.

His
uncertainty
about
the
fatality
of
his
stabbing
caused
one
of
his
followers
,
Roger
de
Kirkpatrick
,
to
utter
the
famous
,
"
I
mak
siccar
"
(
"
I
make
sure
"
)
and
finish
the
Comyn
off
.

Bruce
was
subsequently
excommunicated
as
a
result
,
less
for
the
murder
than
for
its
location
.

Regardless
,
for
Bruce
the
die
was
cast
at
the
moment
in
Greyfriars
and
so
began
his
campaign
by
force
for
the
independence
of
Scotland
.

Swords
were
drawn
by
supporters
of
both
sides
,
the
burial
ground
of
the
Monastery
becoming
the
theatre
of
battle
.

Bruce
and
his
party
then
attacked
Dumfries
Castle
.

The
English
garrison
surrendered
and
for
the
third
time
in
the
day
Bruce
and
his
supporters
were
victorious
.

He
was
crowned
King
of
Scots
barely
seven
weeks
after
.

Bruce
later
triumphed
at
the
Battle
of
Bannockburn
and
led
Scotland
to
freedom
.

Once
Edward
received
word
of
the
revolution
that
had
started
in
Dumfries
,
he
again
raised
an
army
and
invaded
Scotland
.

Dumfries
was
again
subjected
to
the
control
of
Bruce
's
enemies
.

Sir
Christopher
Seton
(
Bruce
's
brother
in
law
)
had
been
captured
at
Loch
Doon
and
was
hurried
to
Dumfries
to
be
tried
for
treason
in
general
and
more
specifically
for
being
present
at
Comyn
's
killing
.

Still
in
0000
and
along
with
two
companions
,
Seton
was
condemned
and
executed
by
hanging
and
then
beheading
at
the
site
of
what
is
now
St
Mary
's
Church
.

In
0000
ten
women
were
accused
of
diverse
acts
of
witchcraft
by
Dumfries
Kirk
Session
although
the
Kirk
Session
minutes
itself
records
nine
witches
.

The
Justiciary
Court
found
them
guilty
of
the
several
articles
of
witchcraft
and
on
00
April
between
0
pm
and
0
pm
in
the
afternoon
they
were
taken
to
the
Whitesands
,
strangled
at
stakes
and
their
bodies
burnt
to
ashes
.

Eighteenth
century
Opposite
the
fountain
in
Dumfries
High
Street
,
adjacent
to
the
present
Marks
and
Spencer
,
was
the
Commercial
and
later
the
County
Hotel
.

Although
the
latter
was
demolished
in
the
0000s
,
the
original
facade
of
the
building
was
retained
and
incorporated
into
new
retail
premises
.

Room
No.
0
of
the
hotel
was
known
as
Bonnie
Prince
Charlie
's
Room
and
appropriately
carpeted
in
the
Royal
Stuart
tartan
.

The
Young
Pretender
had
his
headquarters
here
during
a
0-day
sojourn
in
Dumfries
towards
the
end
of
0000
.

£
0,000
was
demanded
by
the
Prince
,
together
with
0,000
pairs
of
brogues
for
his
kilted
Jacobite
rebel
army
,
which
was
camping
in
a
field
not
one
hundred
yards
distant
.

A
rumour
that
the
Duke
of
Cumberland
was
approaching
,
made
Bonnie
Prince
Charlie
decide
to
leave
with
his
army
,
with
only
£
0,000
and
000
pairs
of
shoes
having
been
handed
over
.

Robert
Burns
moved
to
Dumfriesshire
in
0000
and
Dumfries
itself
in
0000
,
living
there
until
his
death
on
00
July
0000
.

Today
's
Greyfriars
Church
overlooks
the
location
of
a
statue
of
Burns
,
which
was
designed
by
Amelia
Paton
Hill
,
sculpted
in
Carrara
,
Italy
in
0000
,
and
was
unveiled
by
future
Prime
Minister
,
Archibald
Primrose
,
0th
Earl
of
Rosebery
on
0
April
0000
.

Today

After
working
with
Patrick
Miller
of
Dalswinton
,
inventor
William
Symington
intended
to
carry
out
a
trial
in
order
to
show
than
an
engine
would
work
on
a
boat
without
the
boat
catching
fire
.

The
trial
finally
took
place
on
Dalswinton
Loch
near
Dumfries
on
00
October
0000
.

The
experiment
demonstrated
that
a
steam
engine
would
work
on
a
boat
.

Symington
went
on
to
become
the
builder
of
the
first
practical
steamboat
.

00th
century
and
beyond
The
first
official
intimation
that
RAF
Dumfries
was
to
be
built
was
made
in
late
0000
.

The
site
chosen
had
accommodated
light
aircraft
since
about
0000
.

Work
progressed
quickly
,
and
on
00
June
0000
,
the
00
Maintenance
Unit
was
opened
at
Dumfries
.

The
role
of
the
base
during
the
war
also
encompassed
training
.

RAF
Dumfries
had
a
moment
of
danger
on
00
March
0000
,
when
a
German
aircraft
shot
up
the
airfield
beacon
,
but
crashed
shortly
afterwards
.

The
pilot
,
Oberleutnant
Martin
Piscke
was
later
interred
in
Troqueer
Cemetery
in
Dumfries
town
,
with
full
military
honours
.

On
the
night
of
0/0
August
0000
a
Wellington
bomber
with
engine
problems
diverted
to
but
crashed

Dumfries
runway
.

In
World
War
II
the
bulk
of
the
Norwegian
Army
during
their
years
in
exile
in
Britain
consisted
of
a
brigade
in
Dumfries
.

When
the
army
High
Command
took
over
,
there
were
00
officers
and
about
000
privates
in
the
camp
.

The
camp
was
established
in
June
0000
and
named
Norwegian
Reception
Camp
,
consisting
of
some
000
men
and
women
,
mainly
foreign-Norwegian
who
had
volunteered
for
war
duty
in
Norway
during
the
Nazi
occupation
in
early
0000
.

Through
the
summer
the
number
was
built
up
to
around
0,000
under
the
command
of
General
Carl
Gustav
Fleischer

Geography
Like
the
rest
of
Dumfries
and
Galloway
,
of
Scotland
's
three
major
geographical
areas
Dumfries
lies
in
the
Southern
Uplands
.

The
river
Nith
runs
through
Dumfries
toward
the
Solway
Firth
in
a
southwards
direction
splitting
the
town
into
East
and
West
.

At
low
tide
,
the
sea
recedes
to
such
an
extent
on
the
shallow
sloping
sands
of
the
Solway
that
the
length
of
the
Nith
is
extended
by
00
km
to
000.0
km
(
00.0
miles
)
.

This
makes
the
Nith
Scotland
's
seventh
longest
river
.

There
are
several
bridges
across
the
river
within
the
town
.

In
between
the
Devorgilla
(
also
known
as
'
The
Old
Bridge
'
)
and
the
suspension
bridge
is
a
weir
colloquially
known
as
'
The
Caul
'
.

In
wetter
months
of
the
year
the
Nith
can
flood
the
surrounding
streets
.

Dumfries
has
numerous
suburbs
including
Summerhill
,
Summerville
,
Troqueer
,
Georgetown
,
Larchfield
,
Calside
,
Lochside
,
Lincluden
,
Newbridge
Drive
,
Sandside
,
Heathhall
,
Locharbriggs
,
Noblehill
and
Marchmount
.

Maxwelltown
to
the
west
of
the
river
Nith
,
was
formerly
a
Burgh
in
its
own
right
within
The
Stewartry
of
Kirkcudbright
(
also
known
as
Kirkcudbrightshire
)
until
its
incorporation
into
Dumfries
in
0000
;
Summerhill
,
Troqueer
,
Lochside
,
Lincluden
,
Sandside
are
among
other
suburbs
located
on
the
Maxwelltown
side
of
the
river
.

Palmerston
Park
,
home
to
the
town
's
senior
football
team
Queen
of
the
South
,
is
on
Terregles
Street
,
also
on
the
Maxwelltown
side
of
the
river
.

Queensberry
Square
and
High
Street
are
the
central
focal
points
of
the
town
and
this
area
hosts
many
of
the
historical
,
social
and
commercial
enterprises
and
events
of
Dumfries
.

During
the
0000s
,
these
areas
enjoyed
various
aesthetic
recognitions
from
organisations
including
Britain
in
Bloom
.

Climate
As
with
the
rest
of
the
British
Isles
and
Scotland
,
Dumfries
experiences
a
maritime
climate
with
cool
summers
and
mild
winters
.

It
is
one
of
the
less
snowy
locations
in
Scotland
owing
to
its
sheltered
,
low
lying
position
in
the
South
West
of
the
country
.

From
0000
until
0000
,
the
town
held
the
record
for
the
highest
temperature
reading
in
Scotland
,
.

Governance
Scottish
communities
granted
Royal
Burgh
status
by
the
monarch
guarded
the
honour
jealously
and
with
vigour
.

Riding
the
Marches
maintains
the
tradition
of
an
occasion
that
was
,
in
its
day
,
of
great
importance
.

Dumfries
has
been
a
Royal
Burgh
since
0000
,
its
charter
being
granted
by
King
William
the
Lion
in
a
move
that
ensured
the
loyalty
of
its
citizens
to
the
Monarch
.

Although
far
from
the
centre
of
power
in
Scotland
,
Dumfries
had
obvious
strategic
significance
sitting
as
it
does
on
the
edge
of
Galloway
and
being
the
centre
of
control
for
the
south
west
of
Scotland
.

With
the
River
Nith
on
two
sides
and
the
Lochar
Moss
on
another
,
Dumfries
was
a
town
with
good
natural
defences
.

Consequently
it
was
never
completely
walled
.

A
careful
eye
still
had
to
be
kept
on
the
clearly
defined
boundaries
of
the
burgh
,
a
task
that
had
to
be
taken
each
year
by
the
Provost
,
Baillies
,
Burgesses
and
others
within
the
town
.

Neighbouring
landowners
might
try
to
encroach
on
the
town
boundaries
,
or
the
Marches
as
they
were
known
,
moving
them
back
000
yards
or
so
to
their
own
benefit
.

It
had
to
be
made
clear
to
anyone
thinking
of
or
trying
to
encroach
that
they
dare
not
do
so
.

In
return
for
the
Royal
status
of
the
town
and
the
favour
of
the
King
,
the
Provost
and
his
council
,
along
with
other
worthies
of
the
town
had
to
be
diligent
in
ensuring
the
boundaries
were
strictly
observed
.

Although
steeped
in
history
,
Scotland
's
burghs
remained
the
foundation
of
the
country
's
system
of
local
government
for
centuries
.

Burgh
status
conferred
on
its
citizens
the
right
to
elect
their
own
town
councils
,
run
their
own
affairs
and
raise
their
own
local
taxes
or
rates
.

In
0000
the
burghs
became
part
of
larger
districts
and
regions
.

Those
boundaries
lost
the
significance
they
were
granted
by
Royal
statute
.

Ancient
titles
like
Provost
and
Bailie
were
discarded
or
retained
only
for
ceremonial
purposes
.

Robes
and
chains
often
found
their
way
into
museums
as
a
reminder
of
the
past
.

Dumfries
remains
a
centre
of
local
government
for
a
much
bigger
area
than
just
the
town
itself
.

But
its
people
,
the
Doonhamers
still
retain
a
pride
in
their
town
and
distinctive
identity
.

This
is
never
more
so
than
during
the
week
long
Guid
Nychburris
Festival
and
its
highlight
the
Riding
of
the
Marches
which
takes
place
on
the
third
Saturday
in
June
each
year
.

Dumfries
hosts
the
headquarters
of
Dumfries
and
Galloway
Council
.

The
name
Dumfries
and
Galloway
is
given
to
one
of
Scotland
's
00
council
areas
comprising
the
former
(
0000
–
00
)
districts
of
Nithsdale
,
Annandale
and
Eskdale
,
the
Stewartry
of
Kirkcudbrightshire
,
the
Machars
and
Wigtownshire
.

Dumfries
also
lends
its
name
to
the
Lieutenancy
Area
of
Dumfries
,
which
is
similar
in
boundaries
to
the
former
Dumfriesshire
county
.

Dumfries
and
Galloway
is
represented
in
Westminster
by
Russell
Brown
MP
.

Dumfries
is
contained
within
two
separate
constituencies
within
the
Scottish
parliament
–
Dumfriesshire
and
Galloway
,
and
Upper
Nithsdale
.

Dumfriesshire
is
represented
by
Elaine
Murray
MSP
while
Galloway
and
Upper
Nithsdale
is
represented
by
Alex
Fergusson
MSP
.

Dumfries
is
centre
to
Scotland
’s
smallest
police
force
.

It
took
part
in
one
of
the
largest
criminal
investigations
in
modern
history
when
neighbouring
town
,
Lockerbie
,
was
devastated
by
the
events
that
took
place
on
board
Pan
Am
Flight
000
on
00
December
0000
.

Economy
Dumfries
has
a
long
history
as
a
county
town
,
and
as
the
market
town
of
a
surrounding
rural
hinterland
.

Dumfries
is
a
relatively
prosperous
community
but
the
town
centre
has
been
exposed
to
the
centrifugal
forces
that
have
seen
retail
,
business
,
educational
,
residential
and
other
uses
gravitate
towards
the
town
's
urban
fringe
.

This
was
started
in
the
0000s
with
the
building
of
the
Dumfries
bypass
.

The
immediate
effect
of
this
was
as
intended
the
diversion
of
traffic
away
from
transiting
via
the
town
centre
.

This
brought
with
it
an
accompanying
reduction
in
economic
input
to
the
town
centre
.

The
second
effect
of
this
has
been
more
pronounced
.

bypass
have
attracted
development
to
utilise
the
bypass
as
a
high
speed
urban
highway
without
the
bottlenecks
of
the
town
centre
and
without
the
constraining
limited
town
centre
parking
.

In
a
bid
to
stimulate
development
in
Dumfries
town
centre
,
both
economically
and
in
a
social
context
,
several
strategies
have
been
proposed
by
the
controlling
authorities
.

Culture
Dumfries
got
its
nickname
'
Queen
of
the
South
'
from
David
Dunbar
,
a
local
poet
,
who
in
0000
stood
in
the
general
election
.

In
one
of
his
addresses
he
called
Dumfries
"
Queen
of
the
South
"
and
this
became
synonymous
with
the
town
.

The
term
doonhamer
comes
from
the
way
that
natives
of
Dumfries
over
the
years
have
referred
to
the
area
when
working
away
from
home
,
specifically
00th
century
railway
workers
from
Dumfries
who
worked
in
Glasgow
.

The
town
is
often
referred
to
as
doon
hame
(
down
home
)
.

The
term
doonhamer
followed
,
to
describe
those
that
originate
from
Dumfries
.

The
Doonhamers
is
also
the
nickname
of
Queen
of
the
South
who
represent
Dumfries
and
the
surrounding
area
in
the
Scottish
Football
League
.

The
crest
of
Dumfries
contains
the
words
,
"
A
Lore
Burne
"
.

In
the
history
of
Dumfries
close
to
the
town
was
the
marsh
through
which
ran
the
Loreburn
whose
name
became
the
rallying
cry
of
the
town
in
times
of
attack
–
A
Lore
Burne
(
meaning
'
to
the
muddy
stream
'
)
.

The
Loreburn
Hall
(
sometimes
known
colloquially
as
The
Drill
Hall
)
has
hosted
concerts
by
performers
such
as
Black
Sabbath
,
Big
Country
,
The
Proclaimers
and
Scottish
Opera
.

The
hall
has
hosted
sporting
events
such
as
wrestling
.

Clatskanie
(
)
is
a
city
in
Columbia
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
was
named
for
the
Clatskanie
River
,
which
empties
into
the
Columbia
River
within
the
city
limits
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
According
to
some
reports
,
the
original
name
of
this
town
when
it
was
platted
in
0000
,
was
Bryantville
.

However
,
the
post
office
in
this
location
is
shown
as
Clatskanie
as
early
as
December
,
0000
.

Clatskanie
comes
from
a
Native
American
word
,
Tlatskani
.

According
to
the
Clatsop
County
pioneer
Silas
B.
Smith
,
Tlatskani
was
a
point
in
the
Nehalem
River
that
was
reached
from
the
Columbia
River
by
way
of
the
Youngs
River
or
by
way
of
the
Clatskanie
River
.

The
native
inhabitants
,
who
were
not
in
the
habit
of
naming
streams
,
did
not
use
the
word
Tlatskani
for
the
streams
they
would
follow
in
order
to
get
to
that
point
,
but
the
white
men
who
settled
here
later
did
apply
the
name
to
the
streams
.

Clatskanie
is
also
the
name
of
a
Native
American
people
,
whose
numbers
dwindled
from
smallpox
,
intermittent
fever
,
warfare
,
and
intermarriage
until
they
numbered
only
three
people
in
a

Rainier
is
a
city
in
Columbia
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at

census
.

Rainier
is
located
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Columbia
River
across
from
Kelso
and
Longview
,
Washington
History
Rainier
was
founded
in
0000
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Columbia
River
by
Charles
E.
Fox
,
the
town
's
first
postman
.

First
called
Eminence
,
its
name
was
later
changed
to
Fox
's
Landing
and
finally
to
Rainier
.

The
name
Rainier
was
taken
from
Mount
Rainier
in
Washington
,
which
can
be
seen
from
hills
above
the
city
.

Rainier
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

For
much
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
twentieth
century
,
Rainier
was
known
to
the
rest
of
Oregon
as
home
to
Trojan
Nuclear
Power
Plant
,
the
only
commercial
nuclear
reactor
in
the
state
,
which
supplied
electricity
to
Portland
and
its
suburbs
starting
in
March
0000
.

This
reactor
was
closed
periodically
due
to
structural
problems
,
and
in
January
0000
,
it
was
decommissioned
after
cracks
developed
in
the
steam
tubes
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
cooling
tower
was
demolished
.

The
closing
of
the
Trojan
plant
set
off
a
decline
in
the
number
of
businesses
in
the
city
.

While
some
retail
and
services
are
available
in
the
city
,
there
is
currently
,
for

,
no
supermarket
remaining
in

are
available

Helens
,
and
in

Rainier
is
surrounded
by
a

past

and
the
communities
are

of
Rainier
.

These
communities
include
Fern
Hill
,
Hudson
,
Alston
,
Apiary
,
Goble
,

for
Prescott
,
which
is
an
incorporated
city
(
despite
having
neither
a
post
office
nor
a
separate
telephone
exchange
)
,
little
remains
to
identify
these
places
today
other
than
left-over
identifying

historic
landmarks
,
such
as
abandoned

Vernonia
is
a
city
in
Columbia
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
city
is
located
on
the
Nehalem
River
,
in
a
valley
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
Northern
Oregon
Coast
Range
.

It
is
located
the
heart
of
the
most
important
timber-producing
areas
of
the
state
,
and
logging
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
history
of
the
town
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
community
was
first
settled
in
0000
by
the
Parker
and
Van
Blaricom
families
.

Cousins
Judson
Weed
and
Ozias
Cherrington
,
both
of
Ohio
arrived
in
0000
.

Sometime
afterwards
,
the
question
of
a
name
for
the
community
came
up
,
and
Cherrington
suggested
the
name
of
his
daughter
(
Vernona
)
in
Ohio
,
which
was
adopted
.

Due
to
a
clerical
error
during
the
incorporation
process
,
an
"
i
"
was
inserted
in
the
name
.

Cherrington
died
of
a
farming
accident
in
0000
,
having
never
seen
his
daughter
since
his
departure
from
Ohio
.

Vernonia
started
to
become
more
than
an
isolated
farming
community
on
July
00
,
0000
when
the
Oregon-American
Lumber
Company
opened
a
state-of-the-art
lumber
mill
,
which
was
supported
by
a
railroad
line
connecting
Vernonia
to
the
rest
of
the
country
.

Oregon-American
merged
with
Long-Bell
Lumber
Company
in
May
,
0000
,
which
itself
merged
with
International
Paper
in
November
,
0000
.

International
Paper
judged
the
mill
antiquated
,
and
closed
it
on
December
00
,
0000
.

The
city
has
been
severely
impacted
by
floods
on
multiple
occasions
.

The
rains
that
caused
the
Willamette
Valley
Flood
of
0000
flooded
Vernonia
as
well
;
some
homes
in
the
floodplain
were
elevated
,
and
some
flooring
materials
were
replaced
,
mitigating
some
damage
from
later
flooding
.

In
0000
,
heavy
storms
that
impacted
the
Pacific
Northwest
washed
out
roads
and
destroyed
homes
,
cars
,
and
communications
infrastructure
.

Despite
preparations
in
0000
,
in
some
parts
of
town
flood
water
reached
0
feet
above
the
000
year
base
flood
elevation
.

In
the
wake
of
the
0000
flood
,
Vernonia
School
District
voters
approved
a
$
00
million
bond
in
0000
to
build
a

K-00
school
in
Vernonia
.

The

Bandon
(
)
is
a
city
in
Coos
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
,
on
the
south
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
Coquille
River
.

It
was
named
by
George
Bennet
,
an
Irish
peer
,
who
settled
nearby
in
0000
and
named
the
town
after
Bandon
in
Ireland
,
his
hometown
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

In
0000
Bandon
was
named
one
of
the
"
Coolest
Small
Towns
in
America
"
by
BudgetTravel
.

History
Before
0000
,
the
Coquille
Indians
lived
in
the
area
.

Then
in
0000
,
gold
was
discovered
at
nearby
Whiskey
Run
Beach
by
French
Canadian
trapper
s
,
though
the
gold
rush
did
not
have
much
of
an
impact
on
the
area
.

In
0000
,
Henry
Baldwin
,
from
County
Cork
,
Ireland
,
was
shipwrecked
on
the
Coos
Bay
bar
and
walked
into
this
area
.

The
first
permanent
settlers
came
in
0000
and
established
the
present
town
site
.

In
0000
,
the
first
conflicts
with
Native
Americans
arose
and
the
Native
Americans
were
sent
to
the
Siletz
Reservation
.

In
0000
,
the
boat
Twin
Sisters
sailed
into
the
Coquille
River
and
opened
the
outlet
for
all
inland
produce
and
resources
.

Bandon
was
founded
by
the
Irish
peer
George
Bennett
in
0000
.

George
Bennett
,
his
sons
Joseph
and
George
,
and
George
Sealey
came
from
Bandon
,
Ireland
.

The
following
year
the
town
's
previous
name
of
Averille
was
changed
to
Bandon
after
the
town
of
the
same
name
in
Ireland
.

The
next
year
,
Joseph
Williams
and
his
three
sons
arrived
,
also
from
Bandon
,
Ireland
.

In
0000
,
the
post
office
was
established
.

In
0000
,
cheese
making
began
.

That
same
year
,
Congress
appropriated
money
to
build
the
jetty
.

In
0000
,
the
first
sawmill
,
school
house
,
and
Catholic
church
were
built
.

In
0000
,
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
began
construction
on
the
jetty
.

George
Bennett
also
introduced
gorse
(
Ulex
europaeus
)
into
the
local
area
,
which
in
the
following
decades
went
wild
and
became
a
nuisance
in
both
the
town
and
in
the
neighboring
countryside
.

Gorse
,
a
spiny
plant
,
grows
so
thickly
a
person
can
not
walk
through
it
.

It
's
a
very
oily
plant
.

If
a
fire
strikes
,
the
gorse
flares
up
quickly
.

Cranberries
have
been
grown
in
Bandon
since
0000
,
when
Charles
McFarlin
planted
vines
he
brought
from
Massachusetts
.

McFarlin
had
originally
come
to
pan
for
gold
in
California
.

He
did
not
make
his
fortune
,
or
even
a
living
,
so
he
turned
to
what
he
knew
best
.

He
brought
vines
from
Cape
Cod
and
planted
them
in
the
state
's
first
cranberry
bog
near
Hauser
.

This
bog
produced
cranberries
for
eight
decades
.

His
variety
adapted
to
growing
conditions
on
the
west
coast
.

The
variety
was
named
McFarlin
in
his
honor
and
was
the
principal
variety
grown
on
the
west
coast
until
overtaken
by
the
Stevens
variety
.

Bandon
is
also
the
location
of
the
first
cranberry
bogs
to
be
wet
harvested
,
which
is
done
by
building
dikes
around
the
bogs
then
flooding
them
.

Fire
On
September
00
,
0000
a
fire
burned
several
miles
of
forest
east
of
town
.

But
a
sudden
shift
in
the
wind
drove
the
flames
swiftly
westward
.

Ignited
by
the
forest
fire
,
the
town
’s
abundant
gorse
became
engulfed
in
flames
,
Bandon
resident
D.H.
Woomer
told
The
Coos
Bay
Times
.

Bandon
's
entire
commercial
district
was
destroyed
.

The
total
loss
stated
at
the
time
was
$
0
million
USD
,
with
00
fatalities
.

Ironically
,
the
gorse
was
first
introduced
to
the
Oregon
Coast
by
the
founder
of
Bandon
,
Lord
George
Bennett
,
from
his
native
Ireland
.

Firefighters
found
that
burning
gorse
reacted
to
having
water
squirted
on
it
like
a
kitchen
grease
fire
—
it
simply
spread
burning
gobs
of
gorse
everywhere
.

Stewart
Holbrook
described
this
conflagration
in
his
essay
"
The
Gorse
of
Bandon
.
"

Part
of
the
commercial
district
had
been
erected
on
wooden
pilings
jutting
out
over
the
Coquille
River
not
far
from
the
South
Jetty
,
accommodating
river
traffic
at
the
merchants
'
doors
.

After
the
0000
fire
,
when
Bandon
began
to
be
rebuilt
,
the
new
perimeter
of
the
business
district
did
not
extend
beyond
the
available
land
.

There
is
still
gorse
in
Bandon
today
,
but
municipal
codes
strictly
regulate
how
high
and
thick
it
may
be
allowed
to
get
.

Geography
and
climate
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,

Climate
Bandon
has
a
coastal
Mediterranean
climate
.

Just
as
is
common
with
the
coast
of
Oregon
,
rain
and
overcast
conditions
are
more
than
common
in
the
winter
months
,
except
for
the
summer
when
it
is
mostly
dry
.

Snow
can
occur
during
the
winter
,
however
,
this
is
not
very
common
and
usually

or
twice
a
season
.

Below
freezing
temperatures
are
rare
in
the
city
,
usually
occurring
about
once
or
twice
a
winter
.

Extreme

F
to
the
low
00s
°
F
occurs
on
average
about
once

twice
every
three
or
four
years
.

Summer
is
the
one
time
of
the
year
where
the
temperature
is
high
enough
,
and
the
weather
is
well
enough
,
to
go
to
the
beach
.

Bandon

F
was
observed
only
three
months
later
on
December
00
,
0000
.

Economy
Like
many
communities
on
the
Oregon
coast
,
Bandon
had
significant
fishing
and
timber
industries
,
which
were
greatly
diminished
by
the
0000s
,
though
some
remnants
still
exist
.

Bandon

current
economy
revolves
around
wood
products

Coos
Bay
is
a
city
located
in
Coos
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
,
where
the
Coos
River
enters
Coos
Bay
on
the
Pacific
Ocean
.

The
city
borders
the
city
of
North
Bend
,
and
together
they
are
often
referred
to
as
one
entity
called
either
Coos
Bay-North
Bend
or
the
Bay
Area
.

Coos
Bay
's
population
as
of
the
0000
census
was
00,000
residents
,
making
it
the
largest
city
on
the
Oregon
Coast
.

History
Prior
to
Europeans
first
visiting
the
Oregon
coast
,
Native
American
tribes
claimed
the
Coos
Bay
region
as
their
homeland
for
thousands
of
years
.

Members
of
the
Coos
,
Lower
Umpqua
,
Siuslaw
and
Coquille
tribes
lived
,
fished
,
hunted
and
gathered
along
Coos
Bay
and
its
estuaries
,
along
rivers
,
and
in
meadows
and
forests
.

Approximately
000
years
ago
,
British
and
Spanish
explorers
first
approached
the
South
Coast
.

In
0000
Sir
Francis
Drake
is
purported
to
have
sought
shelter
for
his
ship
,
the
Golden
Hinde
,
around
Cape
Arago
.

Trader
and
explorer
Jedediah
Smith
was
in
the
region
seeking
furs
and
the
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
sent
Alexander
McLeod
to
search
for
an
inland
passage
.

Nineteenth
century
The
earliest
settlement
of
European
Americans
in
the
area
was
in
January
0000
when
survivors
of
the
Captain
Lincoln
shipwreck
established
Camp
Castaway
until
they
and
their
cargo
could
be
fully
rescued
.

There
has
been
a
permanent
settlement
on
Coos
Bay
since
0000
,
when
the
town
of
Marshfield
was
founded
there
and
named
after
the
Massachusetts
hometown
of
its
founder
,
J.
C.
Tolman
.

The
first
Methodist
church
in
the
area
was
established
in
0000
.

By
0000
the
inhabitants
,
who
were
reliant
on
the
sea
for
their
income
,
had
built
the
Cape
Arago
Light
.

The
setting
up
of
a
post
office
in
0000
and
the
arrival
of
the
Coos
Bay
Wagon
Road
in
the
town
a
year
later
connected
Coos
County
with
the
Umpqua
River
valley
in
neighbouring
Douglas
County
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
Coast
Range
of
mountains
.

This
wagon
road
,
although
long
gone
in
its
original
form
,
is
still
partially
in
existence
since
the
route
of
Oregon
Route
00
roughly
follows
the
original
right
of
way
.

0000
saw
Coos
Bay
set
up
its
first
,
and
the
state
's
00th
,
chartered
Masonic
Lodge
.

Named
Blanco
Lodge
,
this
brotherhood
was
set
up
by
several
of
the
town
's
founding
fathers
.

With
this
development
,
the
incorporation
of
Marshfield
came
in
0000
.

One
of
the
nation
's
oldest
still-operating
machine
shops
,
the
Nelson
Machine
Works-Coos
Bay
Iron
Works
,
was
set
up
in
0000
.

Twentieth
century
In
0000
the
only
lynching
ever
to
be
documented
in
Oregon
occurred
in
Coos
Bay
,
of
Alonzo
Tucker
,
an
African
American
man
.

He
was
accused
of
raping
a
white
woman
and
escaping
from
jail
.

However
,
there
is
no
record
of
his
escape
from
jail
.

The
only
account
is
that
he
was
caught
by
a
mob
of
000-000
people
,
shot
twice
and
hung
from
the
0th
Street
bridge
,
which
spanned
present
day
Golden
Field
,
where
high
school
soccer
games
are
now
held
.

No
charges
were
ever
brought
to
the
mob
.

The
newspaper
at
that
time
reported
the
mob
was
"
quiet
and
orderly
.
"

Alonzo
Tucker
's
cause
of
death
was
asphyxiation
.

Prior
to
around
0000
,
The
Coos
region
was
largely
isolated
from
the
rest
of
Oregon
due
to
difficulties
in
crossing
the
Coast
Range
and
fording
rivers
,
and
the
Pacific
Ocean
was
used
to
link
people
to
other
areas
,
including
San
Francisco
,
which
was
an
easier
two-day
trip
compared
to
traveling
inland
over
rugged
terrain
.

In
0000
a
rail
line
was
completed
that
linked
the
region
to
other
interior
settlements
and
towns
,
which
increased
commercial
trade
and
tourism
Significant
urban
growth
occurred
in
the
0000s
,
and
during
the
0000s
to
0000s
large-scale
growth
occurred
.

Per
the
Oregon
Bay
Area
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
during
the
0000s
to
0000s
:
Shipyards
contracted
with
the
U.S.
Government
to
build
minesweeper
s
and
rescue
tugs
for
World
War
II
defense
purposes
.

Large
national
lumber
companies
set
up
operations
and
expanded
significantly
for
the
next
two
decades
.

Jetty
improvements
,
commercial
fishing
and
crabbing
shaped
the
development
of
Charleston
.

The
completion
of
the
Coos
Bay
Bridge
(
now
McCullough
Memorial
Bridge
)
in
0000
and
the
Roosevelt
Highway
significantly
improved
modern
transportation
connections
and
provided
the
final
link
in
opening
the
Coos
region
to
the
outside
world
.

The
formerly
remote
district
known
as
the
Coos
Bay
country
had
come
of
age
.

What
now
makes
up
the
central
district
of
Coos
Bay
was
called
Marshfield
until
0000
when
residents
voted
to
change
the
name
to
Coos
Bay
to
match
the
name
of
the
Bay
itself
.

The
City
of
Marshfield
was
named
after
the
Massachusetts
home
town
of
the
Cityʼs
founder
,
J.C.
Tolman
,
and
incorporated
in
0000
.

On
February
0
,
0000
,
a
Japanese
ship
named
the
New
Carissa
ran
aground
on
a
beach
0.0
miles
(
0.0
km
)
north
of
the
entrance
to
Coos
Bay
,
drawing
international
attention
to
the
area
.

The
New
Carissa
was
empty
of
cargo
at
the
time
,
heading
for
the
Port
of
Coos
Bay
to
pick
up
wood
chips
.

When
the
captain
was
told
that
the
weather
was
too
severe
for
the
ship
to
enter
port
,
he
anchored
his
ship
close
by
.

The
crew
put
out
only
one
anchor
,
and
it
appears
that
this
was
probably
on
too
short
a
chain
to
be
effective
.

The
subsequent
US
Coast
Guard
investigation
found
several
other
aspects
of
the
ship
's
company
's
handling
of
the
situation
to
have
been
poor
,
leading
to
the

North
Bend
is
a
city
in
Coos
County
,
Oregon
,
in
the
United
States
with
a
population
of
0,000
as
of
the
0000
census
.

North
Bend
is
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
Coos
Bay
,
an
S-shaped
water
inlet
and
estuary
where
the
Coos
River
enters
Coos
Bay
on
the
Pacific
Ocean
,
and
borders
the
city
of
Coos
Bay
,
Oregon
to
the
south
.

North
Bend
became
an
incorporated
city
in
0000
.

Geography
and
climate
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
,
is
land
and
is
water
.

The
climate
in
North
Bend
and
surrounds
can
be
described
as
a
very
humid
version
of
the
Mediterranean
climate
or
a
dry-summer
version
of
an
oceanic
climate
.

There
is
very
little
temperature
variation
throughout
the
year
,
with
monthly
means
ranging
from
in
December
to
in
August
,
though
on
the
rare
occasions
continental
air
masses
penetrate
they
can
be
much
more
extreme
,
with
the
lowest
on
record
being
on
December
00
,
0000
.

Conversely
,
the
record
high
is
,
set
on
June
00
,
0000
.

Cool
breezes
off
the
Pacific
moderate
the
city
's
climate
year
round
.

Rain
is
abundant
in
winter
,
due
to
moist
low
pressure
troughs
from
the
Pacific
Ocean
.

The
city
's
annual
rainfall
is
about
,
but
totals
are
less
than
an
inch
in
July
and
August
.

Fog
often
blankets
the
coastal
fringe
in
summer
due
to
the
temperature
gradient
between
the
cool
Pacific
Ocean
and
the
warm
inland
,
which
serves
to
keep
temperatures
markedly
cooler
than
in
Eugene
or
even
Seattle
.

Snow
almost
never
falls
in
the
city
,
but
can
be
heavy
in
the
adjacent
Oregon
Coast
Range
.

Nearby
Cape
Blanco
is
one
of
the
windiest
places
on
Earth
,
with
gusts
of
000
miles
per
hour
(
000
km/h
)
or
more
achieved
during
severe
winter
storms
.

Annually
,
the
city
sees
00
days
that
fail
to
reach
and
just
00
days
with
a
temperature
of

Regional
history
Before
Europeans
visited
the
Oregon
coast
,
Native
American
tribes
claimed
the
Coos
Bay
region
as
their
homeland
for
thousands
of
years
.

Members
of
the
Coos
,
Lower
Umpqua
,
Siuslaw
and
Coquille
tribes
lived
,
fished
,
hunted
and
gathered
along
Coos
Bay
and
its
estuaries
,
along
rivers
,
and
in
meadows
and
forests
.

Approximately
000
years
ago
,
British
and
Spanish
explorers
first
approached
the
South
Coast
.

In
0000
Sir
Francis
Drake
is
purported
to
have
sought
shelter
for
his
ship
,
the
Golden
Hinde
,
around
Cape
Arago
.

Trader
and
explorer
Jedediah
Smith
was
in
the
region
seeking
furs
and
the
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
sent
Alexander
McLeod
to
search
for
an
inland
passage
.

The
0000
stranding
of
the
schooner
Captain
Lincoln
on
the
North
Spit
and
the
survivors
'
encampment
and
rescue
brought
attention
to
gold
prospectors
who
came
to
mine
placer
from
area
beaches
.

In
0000
The
Coos
Bay
Commercial
Company
arrived
from
the
Rogue
Valley
and
created
routes
for
settlers
.

Empire
City
was
established
and
was
the
county
seat
of
government
until
0000
.

Entrepreneurs
were
drawn
to
the
area
's
ample
natural
resources
,
and
sawmills
and
shipyards
at
Old
Town
North
Bend
and
Empire
City
spurred
economic
development
and
attracted
workers
.

Rivers
and
slough
s
provided
a
means
to
transport
people
,
forest
,
agricultural
and
coal
products
,
and
towns
provided
hubs
for
inland
transportation
.

Some
of
the
early
industries
in
the
area
included
timber
harvesting
,
shipbuilding
,
farming
,
coal
mining
and
salmon
canning
.

Prior
to
around
0000
,
The
Coos
region
was
largely
isolated
from
the
rest
of
Oregon
due
to
difficulties
in
crossing
the
Coast
Range
and
fording
rivers
,
and
the
Pacific
Ocean
was
used
to
link
people
to
other
areas
,
including
San
Francisco
,
which
was
an
easier
two-day
trip
compared
to
traveling
inland
over
rugged
terrain
.

In
0000
trains
were
established
that
linked
the
region
to
other
interior
settlements
and
towns
,
which
increased
commercial
trade
and
tourism
Significant
urban
growth
occurred
in
the
0000s
,
and
during
the
0000s
to
0000s
large-scale
growth
occurred
.

Per
the
Oregon
Bay
Area
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
during
the
0000s
to
0000s
:
Shipyards
contracted
with
the
U.S.
Government
to
build
minesweeper
s
and
rescue
tugs
for
World
War
II
defense
purposes
.

Large
national
lumber
companies
set
up
operations
and
expanded
significantly
for
the
next
two
decades
.

Jetty
improvements
,
commercial
fishing
and
crabbing
shaped
the
development
of
Charleston
.

The
completion
of
the
Coos
Bay
Bridge
(
now
McCullough
Memorial
Bridge
)
in
0000
and
the
Roosevelt
Highway
significantly
improved
modern
transportation
connections
and
provided
the
final
link
in
opening
the
Coos
region
to
the
outside
world
.

The
formerly
remote
district
known
as
the
Coos
Bay
country
had
come
of
age
.

During
the
interregnum
of
despair
between
Franklin
Roosevelt
's
election
and
his
inauguration
,
the
only
bank
in
North
Bend
,
the
First
National
,
was
forced
to
temporarily
close
its
doors
,
precipitating
a
cash-flow
crisis
for
the
City
of
North
Bend
.

The
city
solved
this
problem
by
minting
currency
using
myrtlewood
discs
printed
on
a
newspaper
press
.

These
coins
,
in
denominations
from
00
cents
to
$
00
,
were
used
to
make
payroll
and
the
city
promised
to
redeem
them
for
cash
as
soon
as
it
became
available
.

However
,
when
the
bank
reopened
and
the
city
appealed
for
people
to
bring
their
myrtlewood
money
in
to
redeem
it
,
many
opted
to
keep
their
tokens
as
collector
's
items
.

After
several
appeals
,
the
city
gave
up
and
announced
that
the
tokens
would
remain
legal
tender
in
the
city
of
North
Bend
in
perpetuity
.

Until
the
0000s
,
people
occasionally
did
cash
in
their
tokens
,
but
the
remaining
pieces
have
become
very
valuable
through
scarcity
and
historical
interest
.

Fewer
than
00
full
sets
are
believed
to
exist
.

Prineville
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Crook
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
was
named
for
the
first
merchant
located
in
the
present
location
,
Barney
Prine
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Prineville
was
founded
in
0000
when
Monroe
Hodges
filed
the
original
plat
for
the
city
.

The
post
office
for
the
community
had
been
established
with
the
name
of
Prine
on
April
00
,
0000
,
but
changed
to
Prineville
on
December
00
,
0000
.

The
city
was
incorporated
by
the
Oregon
Legislative
Assembly
on
October
00
,
0000
,
and
obtained
its
first
high
school
in
0000
.

Long
the
major
town
in
central
Oregon
,
Prineville
was
snubbed
in
0000
when
the
railroad
tycoon
s
James
J.
Hill
and
Edward
H.
Harriman
bypassed
the
city
as
they
laid
track
south
from
The
Dalles
.

In
a
period
when
the
presence
of
a
railroad
meant
the
difference
between
prosperity
and
the
eventual
fate
as
a
ghost
town
,
in
a
0000
election
,
Prineville
residents
voted
000
to
0
to
build
their
own
railway
,
and
raised
the
money
to
connect
their
town
to
the
main
line
away
.

Helped
by
timber
harvests
from
the
nearby
Ochoco
National
Forest
,
the
City
of
Prineville
Railroad
prospered
for
decades
.

The
profits
from
the
railroad
were
so
abundant
that
between
0000
and
0000
,
the
city
levied
no
property
taxes
.

However
,
with
the
decline
of
the
timber
industry
in
Oregon
,
the
railroad
reported
a
loss
of
nearly
$
0
Million
between
0000

Brookings
is
a
city
in
Curry
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
was
named
after
John
E.
Brookings
,
president
of
the
Brookings
Lumber
and
Box
Company
,
which
founded
the
city
in
0000
.

As
of
the
0000
census
the
population
was
0,000
.

The
total
population
of
the
Brookings
area
is
over
00,000
,
which
includes
Harbor
(
a
census-designated
place
)
,
and
others
.

There
have
been
numerous
proposals
to
annex
the
nearby
unincorporated
areas
into
Brookings
;
while
most
attempts
failed
over
the
years
,
one
large
area
north
of
town
owned
by
Borax
has
succeeded
.

This
development
has
the
potential
to
add
approximately
0000
homes
over
the
next
00
years
,
although
developers
expect
many
of
them
to
be
occupied
only
seasonally
.

Due
to
its
location
,
Brookings
is
subject
to
winter
(
and
less
frequently
summer
)
temperatures
considered
unusually
warm
for
the
Oregon
Coast
.

Temperatures
can
reach
00
to
00
degrees
Fahrenheit
(
00
to
00
degrees
Celsius
)
throughout
the
year
.

This
is
due
in
part
to
the
marine
influences
from
its
location
on
the
Pacific
Ocean
,
but
mostly
from
its
situation
at
the
foot
of
the
Klamath
Mountains
,
whose
winds
compress
and
warm
the
air
flowing
onto
Brookings
.

This
is
called
the
Brookings
effect
or
Chetco
effect
.

Heavy
rain
is
common
in
the
winter
.

Heavy
fog
is
common
in
the
summer
.

History
Founding
In
0000
,
the
Brookings
Timber
Company
hired
William
James
Ward
,
a
graduate
in
civil
engineering
and
forestry
,
to
come
to
the
southern
Oregon
Coast
and
survey
its
lumbering
potential
.

After
timber
cruising
the
Chetco
and
Pistol
River
areas
for
several
years
,
he
recommended
that
the
Brookings
people
begin
extensive
lumbering
operations
here
and
secure
a
townsite
for
a
mill
and
shipping
center
.

While
John
E.
Brookings
was
responsible
for
the
founding
of
Brookings
as
a
company
town
,
it
was
his
cousin
Robert
S.
Brookings
,
who
was
responsible
for
its
actual
design
.

The
latter
Brookings
hired
Bernard
Maybeck
,
an
architect
based
in
San
Francisco
who
was
later
involved
in
the
Panama-Pacific
Exposition
,
to
lay
out
the
plat
of
the
townsite
.

World
War
II
On
September
0
,
0000
,
Mount
Emily
,
near
Brookings
,
became
the
first
site
in
the
continental
United
States
to
suffer
aerial
bombardment
in
wartime
.

A
Japanese
floatplane
piloted
by
Nobuo
Fujita
launched
from
submarine
I-00
was
loaded
with
incendiary
bombs
and
sent
to
start
massive
fires
in
the
dense
forests
of
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

The
attack
caused
only
minor
damage
.

Fujita
would
be
invited
back
to
Brookings
in
0000
and
he
presented
the
town
his
family
's
000-year
old
samurai
sword
in
friendship
after
the
Japanese
government
was
given
assurances
that
he
would
not
be
tried
as
a
war
criminal
.

Brookings
made
him
an
honorary
citizen
several
days
before
his
death
in
0000
.

0000s
Since
the
0000s
,
Brookings
has
attracted
retirees
,
largely
from
California
,
who
have
come
to
form
a
sizeable
minority
of
the
population
.

Their
political
influence
is
felt
in
routinely
voting
against
new
taxes
.

It
is
also
home
for
a
number
of
people
who
commute
to
jobs
in
California
—
mostly
at
nearby
Pelican
Bay
State
Prison
.

0000
Tsunami
The
Port
of
Brookings
Harbor
was
severely
damaged
by
tidal
surge
s
from
a
tsunami
on
March

,
0000
.

The
largest
surge
was
estimated
to
be
nearly
.

Boats
were
damaged
,
sunk
,
set
adrift
,
and
swept
out
to
sea
after
many
docks
were
torn
away
and
pilings
broken
.

The
tsunami
was
caused
by
the
0.0
MW
Tōhoku
earthquake
offshore
of
the
east
coast
of
Honshu
Island
,
Japan
.

The
damage
was

Port
Orford
(

’
ee-ghi
~

-

an
’
)
is
a
city
in
Curry
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
is
on
the
southern
Oregon
Coast
,
at
the
northern
end
of
what
coastal
Oregonians
call
the
Banana
Belt
,
because
the
weather
from
Port
Orford
south
is
noticeably
warmer
than
the
weather
north
of
nearby
Cape
Blanco
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
city
takes
its
name
from
George
Vancouver
's
original
name
for
Cape
Blanco
,
which
he
named
for
George
,
Earl
of
Orford
,
"
a
much-respected
friend
.
"

History
Before
the
arrival
of
European
settlers
,
the
Port
Orford
area
was
inhabited
by
Tututni
peoples
.

The
Tututni
languages
were
a
part
of
the
Pacific
Coast
Athabaskan
language
family
.

The
first
European
settlers
,
led
by
Captain
William
Tichenor
,
arrived
in
0000
.

Tichenor
,
needing
to
return
to
the
north
for
supplies
,
left
a
group
of
nine
men
behind
.

However
,
members
of
the
local
Qua-to-mah
tribe
reacted
with
hostility
to
the
newcomers
,
who
they
felt
were
encroaching
on
their
territory
.

Taking
up
a
position
on
a
nearby
seastack
,
now
known
as
Battle
Rock
,
the
settlers
were
attacked
by
a
band
of
more
than
000
Qua-to-mahs
.

Twenty-three
natives
were
killed
,
and
two
of
Tichenor
's
men
were
wounded
in
the
ensuing
conflict
.

Soon
afterward
,
a
truce
was
called
between
the
two
groups
,
when
the
settlers
told
the
natives
that
they
would
be
leaving
in
00
days
.

For
the
next
two
weeks
,
the
settlers
did
not
see
any
members
of
the
local
tribe
.

However
,
after
the
00th
day
,
an
even
larger
band
of
natives
than
the
first
attacked
.

During
the
battle
,
the
chief
of
the
tribe
was
killed
.

Retreating
with
their
dead
chief
,
the
tribe
set
up
camp
nearby
.

The
settlers
soon
fled
north
under
cover
of
darkness
.

Port
Orford
was
formally
founded
in
0000
.

It
would
serve
as
a
receiving
port
for
mercantile
and
fishing
.

The
port
district
was
formally
set
up
more
than
00
years
later
,
in
0000
.

It
was
during
this
time
that
Port
Orford
would
become
a
shipping
port
for
local
Port
Orford
Cedar
.

The
port
was
sold
in
0000
.

However
,
in
0000
,
a
little
more
than
000
years
since
the
city
's
founding
,
the
port
was
bought
back
.

Eventually
,
Port
Orford
would
see
a
decline
in
fishing
and
the
shipping
of
timber
would
cease
.

In
October
0000
,
then-mayor
Gilbert
Gable
,
frustrated
with
the
poor
condition
of
the
state
roads
around
Port
Orford
,
which
hampered
economic
development
,
suggested
that
a
number
of
counties
along
the
Oregon
and
California
state
border
should
secede
and
create
the
State
of
Jefferson
.

This
movement
came
to
an
end
with
U.S.
involvement
in
World
War
II
.

The
port
is
an
open-water
dock
(
no
natural
protection
)
and
boasts
the
only
drydock
port
on
the
West
Coast
.

The
fishing
boats
are
lifted
in
and
out
of
the
water
by
operated
cranes
,
set
on
custom-made
dollies
and
parked
in
rows
on
the
dock
.

As
a
result
,
it
is
known
as
a
"
dolly
dock
.

History
The
name
Bend
was
derived
from
"
Farewell
Bend
"
,
the
designation
used
by
early
pioneers
to
refer
to
the
location
along
the
Deschutes
River
where
the
town
was
eventually
platted
,
one
of
the
few
fordable
points
along
the
river
.

For
at
least
00,000
years
,
until
the
winter
of
0000
,
the
Bend
area
was
known
only
to
Native
Americans
who
hunted
and
fished
there
.

That
year
,
members
of
a
fur
trapping
party
led
by
Peter
Skene
Ogden
visited
the
area
.

John
C.
Frémont
,
John
Strong
Newberry
,
and
other
Army
survey
parties
came
next
.

Then
pioneers
heading
farther
west
passed
through
the
area
and
forded
the
Deschutes
River
at
Farewell
Bend
.

Constructed
in
May
0000
,
the
Pilot
Butte
Development
Company
's
little
plant
was
the
first
commercial
sawmill
in
Bend
.

The
original
location
was
at
the
rear
of
the
Pilot
Butte
Inn
of
later
years
.

Steidl
and
Reed
also
set
up
a
small
mill
in
Bend
in
0000
.

This
was
on
the
Deschutes
River
just
below
the
Pioneer
Park
area
.

The
mill
was
operated
by
water
power
.

A
small
community
developed
around
the
area
,
and
in
0000
,
a
city
was
incorporated
by
a
general
vote
of
the
community
's
000
residents
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
the
city
held
its
first
official
meeting
as
an
incorporated
municipality
,
appointing
A.
H.
Goodwillie
as
the
first
mayor
.

The
settlement
was
originally
called
"
Farewell
Bend
"
,
which
was
later
shortened
to
"
Bend
"
by
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
.

In
0000
,
Mirror
Pond
was
created
by
the
construction
of
the
Bend
Water
,
Light
&
Power
Company
dam
on
the
Deschutes
River
in
Bend
.

The
dam
provided
the
city
with
its
initial
source
of
electricity
.

The
dam
has
been
owned
by
Pacific
Power
since
0000
and
still
produces
electricity
that
supplies
approximately
000
Bend
households
.

In
0000
,
Deschutes
County
,
Oregon
was
formed

County
and
Bend
was
designated
as
the
county
seat
.

In

,
Bend
amended
the
charter
and
adopted
the
council-manager
form
of
government

Construction
and

According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Commerce
's
Bureau
of
Economic
Analysis
,
in
0000
construction
and
real
estate
accounted
for
00.0
%
of
all
jobs
in
the
Bend
metropolitan
statistical
area
(
MSA
)
,
which
constitutes
all
of
Deschutes
County
.

This
figure
is
about
00
%
more
than
the
proportion
of
construction
and
real
estate
jobs
in
the
Oregon
and
national
economies
.

However
,
construction
activity
in
Bend
appears
to
be
slowing
-
the
number
of
building
permit
applications
received
by
the
Bend
City
Building

fell
from

in

0000
to

,
a

decrease
.

A
large
influx
of
new
residents
drawn
by
Bend
's
lifestyle
amenities
,
along
with
the
low
interest
rates
and
easy
lending
that
fostered
a
national
housing
boom
in
0000-0000
,
resulted
in
increased
activity
in
Bend
's
construction
and
real
estate
sectors
and
have
caused
the
rate
of
home
price
appreciation
in
Bend
to
grow
substantially
during
that
period
.

Median
home
prices
in
the
Bend
MSA
increased
by
over
00
%
in
the
0000-0000
period
.

In
June
0000
,
Money
magazine
named
the
Bend
MSA
the
fifth
most
overpriced
real
estate
market
in
the
United
States
.

By
September
0000
,
the
Bend
metro
area
ranked
second
in
the
list
of
most
overpriced
housing
markets
,
and
in
June
0000
it
was
named
the
most
overpriced
housing
market
in
America
.

The
0000/0000
housing
downturn
had
a
strong
effect
on
Bend
's
housing
and
economic
situation
.

According
to
the
Seattle
Times
,
single-family
home
prices
dropped
more
than
00
percent
from
a
peak
of
$
000,000
in
May
0000
to
$
000,000
in
March
0000
.

Additional
signs
of
the
housing
downturn
include
an
April

Deschutes
county
unemployment
rate
of
00.0
percent
and
in
a

counties
a

rise
in
homelessness
from

Reedsport
is
a
city
in
Douglas
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
population
was
0,000
.

History
Reedsport
was
established
on
the
estuary
of
the
Umpqua
River
on
January
0
,
0000
.

It
was
named
for
a
local
settler
,
Alfred
W.
Reed
,
who
founded
the
city
in
0000
.

The
post
office
was
established
July
00
,
0000
.

The
building
of
Southern
Pacific
Railroad
lines
extending
south
to
Coos
Bay
led
to
the
development
of
Reedsport
.

Before
the
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
Reedsport
was
a
camp
for
railroad
construction
workers
.

Built
on
marshy
ground
,
for
much
of
its
history
Reedsport
has
struggled
with
frequent
flooding
;
most
of
its
early
buildings
were
elevated
three
to
eight
feet
above
ground
.

Following
a
devastating
flood
in
0000
,
a
dike
was
constructed
to
protect
the
lower
town
.

During
this
flood
,
the
waters
reached
the
fish
hatchery
and
overflowed
the
fish
troughs
allowing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
small-mouth
bass
to
be
introduced
into
the
Umpqua
River
.

According
to
fishing
reports
small-mouth
bass
became
the
most
abundant
fish
in
the
Umpqua
River
.

Every
few
years
,
flooding
will
occur
enough
that
city
employees
will
close
these
dikes
to
prevent
low-lying
areas
of
the
town
from
flooding
.

In
the
last
quarter
of
the
00th
century
,
Reedsport
struggled
with
the
collapse
of
the
Oregon
timber
industry
.

In
the
last
two
decades
,
Reedsport
has
seen
an
increase
of
tourism
.

Part
of
this
is
due
to
its
close
proximity
to
the
fishing
of
the
Umpqua
River
.

Another
part
of
the
recent
surge
in
tourism
is
due
to
the
sand
dunes
that
are
near
Reedsport
.

Although
the
U.S.
Forest
Service
maintains
a
local
office
in
the
town
,
Reedsport
's
historic
connection
with
the
timber
industry
ended
in
0000
with
the
closing
of
the
International
Paper
plant
in
nearby
Gardiner
.

Recently
,
Reedsport
has
seen
a
rise
in
tourism
due
to
recreation
at
the
nearby
Oregon
Dunes
National
Recreation
Area
.

A
number
of
businesses
catering
to
all-terrain
vehicle
s
have
opened
in
Reedsport
to
serve
the
needs
of
this
growing
activity
.

Geography
and
climate
Reedsport
is
at
the
junction
of
Oregon
Route

and

The
People
First
Party
(
PFP
;
)
is
a
conservative
political
party
in
the
Republic
of
China
(
ROC
)
.

History
The
PFP
was
founded
by
James
Soong
and
his
supporters
after
his
failed
independent
bid
for
the
presidency
in
0000
.

Soong
is
the
chairman
and
dominates
much
of
its
politics
.

The
name
of
the
party
,
qinmin
,
has
Confucian
connotations
.

The
official
goals
of
PFP
,
as
regards
to
cross-strait
relationships
and
diplomacy
,
is
for
the
ROC
to
:
participate
in
more
international
organizations
,
promote
Chinese
culture
overseas
and
seek
economic
and
cultural
interaction
between
Taiwan
and
the
mainland
.

Its
views
are
seen
as
generally
favorable
towards
Chinese
unification
and
staunchly
against
Taiwan
independence
.

The
party
maintains
a
close
but
tense
relationship
with
the
Kuomintang
(
KMT
)
as
part
of
the
pan-blue
coalition
.

However
,
since
PFP
had
,
like
the
New
Party
,
grown
out
of
the
KMT
,
the
two
parties
had
to
compete
for
the
same
set
of
voters
.

This
dynamic
in
which
both
the
KMT
and
PFP
must
simultaneously
compete
and
cooperate
with
each
other
has
led
to
complex
and
interesting
politics
.

In
several
notable
cases
,
this
has
led
to
situations
in
which
both
parties
have
run
candidates
,
but
close
to
the
election
the
party
with
the
less
popular
candidate
unofficially
dropped
out
of
the
race
.

This
in
turn
has
led
to
some
notable
situations
when
either
the
PFP
or
the
KMT
has
campaigned
against
its
own
candidate
,
which
has
led
to
intra-party
resentment
.

To
avoid
a
repeat
of
this
effect
,
which
led
to
the
election
of
Democratic
Progressive
Party
candidate
Chen
Shui-bian
to
the
presidency
in
0000
by
a
low
share
of
votes
,
Chairman
Soong
ran
as
vice-president
on
KMT
Chairman
Lien
Chan
's
presidential
ticket
in
the
0000
presidential
election
.

After
his
defeat
in
Taipei
mayoral
election
on
0
December
0000
,
Soong
announced
that
he
would
quit
political
life
,
including
the
chairmanship
of
the
Party
.

At
this
point
,
with
no
clear
goals
,
the
PFP
faced
an
uncertain
future
,
and
considered
merging
with
the
Kuomintang
.

After
much
negotiation
,
the
PFP
and
the
KMT
did
not
merge
.

0000
Presidential
election
In
September
0000
,
James
Soong
mounted
the
PFP
's
first-ever
presidential
bid
and
selected
academic
Ruey-Shiung
Lin
to
be
his
running
mate
.

The
PFP
collected
sufficient
signatures
to
qualify
for
the
0000
Presidential
Election
ballot
.

The
Soong-Lin
ticket
was
listed
third
on
the
Election
Day
ballot
as
determined
by
a
random
draw
.

The
DPP
's
Tsai-Su
ticket
appeared
first
,
and
the
incumbent
KMT
's
Ma-Wu
ticket
appeared
second
.

While
analysts
feared
that
a
PFP
run
will
split
the
Pan-Blue
Coalition
vote
and
hand
a
winnable
election
to
the
DPP
(
as
was
the
case
in
the
0000
Presidential
election
)
,
Soong
has
insisted
that
his
campaign
is
a
serious
one
and
that
he
will
complete
his
run
.

On
election
day
,
however
,
the
Soong-Lin
ticket
underperformed
and
garnered
a
mere
0.00
%
of
votes
.

James
Soong
Chu-yu
(
;
born
March
00
,
0000
)
,
is
a
politician
in
the
Republic
of
China
on
Taiwan
.

He
founded
and
chairs
the
People
First
Party
,
a
smaller
party
in
the
Kuomintang
(
KMT
)
-
led
Pan-Blue
Coalition
.

Born
to
a
Kuomintang
military
family
of
Hunanese
origin
,
Soong
began
his
political
career
as
a
Secretary
to
Premier
Chiang
Ching-kuo
(
later
President
)
and
rose
to
prominence
as
Director-General
of
the
Government
Information
Office
from
0000
to
0000
.

Upon
Chiang
's
death
Soong
was
instrumental
in
silencing
conservatives
in
the
KMT
from
blocking
the
ascendancy
of
Lee
Teng-hui
as
KMT
leader
.

Soong
was
the
only
elected
governor
of
Taiwan
Province
from
0000
to
0000
,
before
the
streamlining
of
the
provincial
government
.

He
placed
second
in
the
0000
presidential
election
;
his
independent
candidacy
split
the
pro-
Chinese
reunification
vote
between
himself
and
the
KMT
candidate
Lien
Chan
leading
to
the
ascendency
of
Democratic
Progressive
Party
candidate
Chen
Shui-bian
.

In
the
0000
presidential
election
,
he
ran
as
vice
president
on
the
ticket
of
KMT
chairman
Lien
Chan
;
they
narrowly
lost
to
Chen
Shui-bian
.

Soong
ran
again
as
a
candidate
in
the
0000
Presidential
race
,
garnering
0.00
%
of
popular
support
.

Early
life
and
education
Soong
was
born
in
Xiangtan
,
Hunan
province
in
mainland
China
.

It
is
said
his
grandfather
taught
at
the
same
school
Mao
Zedong
attended
as
a
student
.

His
father
,
Soong
Ta
(
宋達
)
,
was
a
career
military
officer
staunchly
loyal
to
ROC
President
Chiang
Kai-shek
and
rose
to
the
rank
of
Major
General
in
the
Nationalist
Army
from
an
enlisted
sailor
.

With
the
Nationalist
defeat
in
the
Chinese
Civil
War
,
the
family
fled
to
Taiwan
in
0000
.

He
earned
his
bachelor
's
degree
in
diplomacy
from
National
Chengchi
University
in
0000
.

Soong
travelled
to
the
United
States
for
graduate
school
and
received
an
M.A.
in
political
science
from
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
in
0000
and
an
M.S.
in
library
science
from
The
Catholic
University
of
America
in
0000
.

He
earned
a
Ph.D.
in
political
science
from
Georgetown
University
in
0000
.

While
at
Berkeley
,
Soong
met
his
future
wife
Viola
Chen
(
陳萬水
)
.

They
later
had
a
son
and
a
daughter
.

Rise
to
power
As
he
was
finishing
his
doctoral
studies
,
he
was
recommended
by
Government
Information
Office
(
GIO
)
Director
Frederick
Chien
to
be
the
English
secretary
of
then-Premier
Chiang
Ching-kuo
.

Soong
served
as
Secretary
to
Premier
from
0000
–
0000
and
with
Chiang
Ching-kuo
's
accession
to
the
presidency
,
the
Personal
Secretary
to
the
President
from
0000
–
0000
and
0000-0000
.

Soong
gained
his
public
fame
when
he
addressed
the
nation
following
the
Carter
administration
's
decision
to
break
ties
with
the
ROC
in
order
to
switch
diplomatic
ties
to
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
on
December
00
,
0000
in
which
he
gave
a
patriotic
condemnation
of
the
American
position
and
a
ringing
defense
of
the
ROC
.

Soon
afterwards
,
President
Chiang
promoted
Soong
to
become
the
youngest
Director-General
of
the
Government
Information
Office
,
in
which
he
served
from
0000
to
0000
.

Soong
and
the
rise
of
Lee
Teng-hui
Upon
Chiang
Ching-kuo
's
death
in
0000
,
Soong
was
seen
as
instrumental
in
consolidating
the
power
of
the
new
president
,
Lee
Teng-hui
.

Soong
was
part
of
the
Palace
Faction
(
宮廷派
)
that
included
Chiang
loyalists
such
as
Hau
Pei-tsun
and
Lee
Huan
and
which
sought
to
limit
Lee
Teng-hui
and
his
native
Taiwanese
faction
's
role
in
the
government
.

During
the
KMT
's
central
standing
committee
on
the
day
of
Chiang
's
funeral
,
when
the
Palace
Faction
sought
to
delay
Lee
's
accession
to
the
party
Chairmanship
,
Soong
unexpectedly
made
an
impassioned
plea
in
favor
of
Lee
,
declaring
that
"
Each
day
of
delay
is
a
day
of
disrespect
to
Ching-kuo
.
"

He
also
made
a
veiled
criticism
of
Soong
May-ling
(
with
whom
he
was
unrelated
)
,
implying
that
she
had
returned
to
Taiwan
after
her
stepson
's
death
to
try
to
reassume
power
.

Soong
established
himself
as
one
of
the
few
mainlanders
who
were
also
loyal
to
Lee
.

In
support
of
Soong
,
Lee
coined
the
term
"
New
Taiwanese
"
to
describe
a
person
born
in
mainland
China
,
raised
in
Taiwan
,
who
calls
Taiwan
home
.

Lee
moved
swiftly
to
promote
Soong
to
KMT
Secretary-General
,
a
position
Soong
held
from
0000
to
0000
.

In
0000
,
Lee
appointed
him
Governor
of
Taiwan
Province
.

Governorship
In
0000
Soong
became
the
only
directly
elected
Governor
of
Taiwan
Province
.

He
was
widely
perceived
to
be
an
excellent
campaigner
and
his
excellent
showing
in
the
governorship
ended
hopes
by
the
DPP
of
a
"
Yeltsin
effect
"
,
by
which
an
elected
governor
would
have
more
legitimacy
than
the
national
government
.

Despite
his
Mainlander
background
,
Soong
proved
to
be
a
popular
politician
among
all
ethnic
groups
on
Taiwan
,
in
part
because
he
was
one
of
the
first
KMT
politicians
to
attempt
to
use
the
Taiwanese
language
in
political
and
formal
occasions
.

After
Premier
Lien
Chan
was
elected
vice
president
in
0000
,
the
premiership
was
to
be
vacated
.

Soong
felt
that
as
Governor
of
Taiwan
,
he
was
the
natural
successor
to
Lien
,
but
Lee
believed
that
Soong
should
serve
out
his
term
.

Lee
appointed
Vincent
Siew
,
whom
Soong
considered
a
subordinate
,
and
this
act
led
to
the
split
between
Soong
and
Lee
.

The
position
of
Governor
of
Taiwan
was
eliminated
in
0000
following
a
National
Development
Council
meeting
in
0000
,
when
it
suggested
that
the
administrative
structure
of
the
Taiwanese
government
be
streamlined
.

Soong
and
his
supporters
believe
this
to
have
been
a
political
move
by
Lee
to
cut
off
Soong
's
power
base
,
but
proponents
of
the
downsizing
called
it
a
pragmatic
move
to
eliminate
contradictory
administrative
territory
.

Soong
tendered
his
resignation
on
December
00
of
the
same
year
,
but
Lee
did
not
accept
it
.

0000
presidential
elections
After
losing
the
KMT
presidential
nomination
to
then-vice
president
Lien
Chan
,
Soong
ran
as
an
independent
in
the
0000
Presidential
elections
.

Soong
advocated
a
gradual
union
between
Taiwan
and
the
mainland
by
first
signing
a
non-aggression
pact
followed
by
the
formation
of
a
cross-strait
union
similar
to
the
European
Union
.

His
platform
called
for
the
characterization
of
relations
between
the
Mainland
and
Taiwan
as
neither
foreign
nor
domestic
.

Although
widely
seen
as
the
candidate
most
friendly
to
Mainland
China
,
Soong
took
particular
effort
to
counter
the
perception
that
he
would
"
sell
out
"
Taiwan
.

The
KMT
responded
by
expelling
Soong
and
his
supporters
from
the
party
.

In
the
final
months
leading
to
the
0000
elections
,
the
KMT
,
then
under
Lee
Teng-hui
's
leadership
,
sued
Soong
for
theft
,
alleging
that
as
party
Secretary-General
,
he
stole
millions
of
Taiwan
dollars
in
cash
intended
for
the
family
of
the
late
President
Chiang
Ching-kuo
and
hid
the
money
in
the
Chunghsing
Bills
Finance
Company
.

In
defense
he
stated
that
the
money
in
those
bank
accounts
was
in
fact
all
from
the
KMT
,
and
he
insisted
that
the
money
transfer
was
authorized
by
then-KMT
chairman
,
Lee
Teng-hui
.

These
statements
have
been
substantiated
by
an
internal
KMT
memo
signed
by
Lee
which
were
published
by
the
court
many
years
later
.

The
scandal
hurt
Soong
's
clean
image
.

Initially
leading
in
the
polls
,
Soong
narrowly
lost
the
election
with
00.00
%
of
the
vote
to
Chen
Shui-bian
of
the
Democratic
Progressive
Party
with
00.0
%
.

Lien
came
in
a
distant
third
with
only
00.0
%
.

One
common
belief
from
the
pro-blue
camp
in
Taiwan
is
that
Lee
Teng-hui
favored
the
unpopular
Vice
President
Lien
Chan
over
the
highly
popular
Soong
in
a
deliberate
effort
to
sabotage
the
Kuomintang
and
was
secretly
supporting
Chen
,
despite
the
fact
that
Lee
is
supposed
to
favor
Kuomintang
's
own
nominee
Lien
.

Some
believe
Lee
feared
Soong
would
expose
the
corruption
in
his
administration
,
and
undermine
his
legacy
.

After
losing
the
election
,
Soong
's
supporters
protested
in
front
of
the
KMT
party
headquarters
and
blockaded
the
building
for
a
few
days
.

They
succeeded
in
pressuring
Lee
Teng-hui
to
resign
as
KMT
Chairman
in
favor
of
Lien
Chan
.

Within
weeks
,
Soong
and
his
supporters
formed
the
People
First
Party
(
PFP
)
,
considered
a
spin-off
from
the
KMT
.

Prosecutors
later
dropped
all
charges
against
Soong
in
the
Chunghsing
Scandal
.

In
0000
,
the
investigation
was
reopened
,
with
former
President
Lee
(
now
expelled
from
the
KMT
and
the
"
spiritual
leader
"
of
the
pro-independence
Taiwan
Solidarity
Union
)
testifying
against
Soong
in
court
.

However
,
with
the
KMT
allied
with
the
People
First
Party
for
the
0000
presidential
election
,
the
KMT
aided
Soong
in
his
defense
,
providing
documents
signed
by
Lee
.

KMT
Chairman
Lien
Chan
claimed
the
KMT
was
misled
into
filing
the
lawsuit
against
Soong
.

The
KMT
dropped
the
charges
and
is
still
trying
to
collect
the
money
that
had
been
returned
and
was
deposited
in
the
court
by
Soong
.

0000
presidential
elections
Despite
the
personal
rivalries
between
Lien
,
the
KMT
chairman
after
0000
,
and
Soong
,
the
KMT
and
People
First
Party
pledged
to
cooperate
in
future
elections
to
prevent
splitting
the
vote
.

Though
losses
in
the
0000
legislative
elections
made
the
DPP
the
largest
single
party
in
the
Legislative
Yuan
,
the
pan-blue
coalition
retained
a
narrow
majority
over
the
pan-green
coalition
.

Soong
ran
as
Vice
Presidential
candidate
under
Lien
Chan
in
the
0000
elections
.

Some
believe
that
the
PFP
's
lack
of
experienced
candidates
in
the
December
0000
mayoral
elections
in
Taipei
and
Kaohsiung
(
the
PFP
supported
the
KMT
's
candidates
)
,
and
the
PFP
's
poor
performance
the
city
council
elections
in
those
cities
at
the
same
time
were
major
setbacks
to
Soong
's
chances
of
being
the
KMT-PFP
candidate
for
president
.

There
were
widespread
rumors
that
Soong
agreed
to
take
the
Vice-Presidential
post
in
exchange
for
a
pledge
by
Lien
to
give
him
significant
power
including
the
Premiership
.

Many
KMT
members
opposed
the
linkage
as
they
considered
Soong
an
opportunist
and
traitor
.

Soong
's
supporters
pointed
out
that
he
was
more
popular
than
Lien
,
as
consistently
demonstrated
by
polls
,
and
the
results
of
the
0000
presidential
elections
.

Though
both
men
garnered
a
combined
00
%
of
the
vote
in
0000
(
compared
to
Chen
's
00
%
)
they
lost
to
Chen
in
0000
by
a
mere
0.00
%
of
the
vote
and
never
conceded
.

After
the
0000
election
After
the
0000
Presidential
election
,
Soong
actively
sought
the
merger
of
the
KMT
and
People
First
Party
.

However
,
he
ceased
doing
so
after
the
ROC
Legislative
Election
,
0000
.

Although
the
pan-blue
coalition
did
well
,
the
PFP
did
not
,
and
Soong
ended
talk
of
a
KMT-PFP
merger
.

In
February
0000
,
he
signed
a
00
point
consensus
program
with
President
Chen
Shui-Bian
which
brought
heavy
criticism
to
Chen
.

The
possibility
of
DPP-PFP
cooperation
ended
in
May
0000
,
when
Soong
visited
mainland
China
to
meet
with
Hu
Jintao
of
the
Communist
Party
of
China
.

Initially
,
Chen
stated
that
Soong
was
to
deliver
a
secret
message
to
the
PRC
leadership
,
but
Soong
denied
this
.

In
the
0000
KMT
chairmanship
election
,
Soong
,
who
retains
significant
following
within
the
KMT
,
despite
initially
instructing
party
officials
not
to
support
either
Ma
Ying-jeou
or
Wang
Jin-pyng
,
endorsed
Wang
at
the
last
minute
.

The
endorsement
appeared
to
backfire
,
however
,
as
Ma
defeated
Wang
by
a
rather
large
margin
of
00
%
to
00
%
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
Soong
,
unopposed
,
was
reelected
chairman
of
the
PFP
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
Soong
was
awarded
NT$
00
million
in
a
defamation
suit
against
former
President
Lee
Teng-hui
,
who
had
alleged
that
Soong
was
playing
mahjong
while
his
supporters
were
protesting
on
the
streets
in
April
0000
.

A
three-judge
panel
of
the
Taipei
District
Court
ruled
that
Lee
must
apologize
and
compensate
Soong
,
saying
that
Lee
's
"
groundless
"
remark
had
damaged
Soong
's
reputation
.

In
addition
,
the
court
ordered
Lee
to
publish
a
half-page
apology
in
major
newspapers
for
three
consecutive
days
.

Visit
to
mainland
China
0000
Soong
's
visit
to
mainland
China
followed
quickly
on
the
heels
of
the
trail-blazing
visit
of
KMT
Chairman
Lien
Chan
.

A
few
weeks
after
shaking
Lien
's
hands
at
the
airport
and
wishing
him
luck
,
Soong
took
his
turn
at
the
spotlight
.

Despite
early
predictions
by
critics
that
the
two
political
peers
would
try
to
out-stage
each
other
,
the
two
visits
proved
to
be
similar
and
complementary
in
many
respects
.

Soong
's
whirlwind
0
day
,
0
city
"
Bridge
Laying
"
tour
began
on
May
0
,
with
a
trip
to
the
traditional
Chinese
capital
of
Xi'an
.

There
,
he
visited
the
tomb
memorial
for
the
Yellow
Emperor
,
a
near-mythical
historical
figure
from
whom
the
Chinese
believe
they
are
descended
.

He
then
visited
Nanjing
,
the
former
capital
of
the
Republic
of
China
,
where
he
visited
the
tomb
of
ROC
founder
Sun
Yat-sen
.

After
a
brief
visit
to
Shanghai
,
Soong
made
an
emotional
return
to
his
ancestral
home
in
Hunan
province
.

Soong
and
his
family
visited
and
honored
the
grave
of
his
maternal
grandmother
buried
in
Xiangtan
in
a
widely
televised
emotional
ceremony
.

Choosing
to
appear
as
familiar
as
possible
to
his
mainland
hosts
,
Soong
spoke
his
greetings
in
the
local
dialect
in
each
of
the
cities
that
he
visited
.

Beyond
sentimental
visits
,
the
important
political
aspect
of
his
tour
comes
from
his
visit
to
Beijing
.

There
,
he
shook
hands
with
the
general
secretary
of
the
Communist
Party
of
China
Hu
Jintao
and
exchanged
presents
with
him
;
Soong
gave
Hu
a
work
of
glass
art
from
Liuli
Gongfang
,
and
received
a
piece
of
Jingdezhen
pottery
from
Hu
.

Soong
was
only
the
second
major
political
figure
from
Taiwan
to
ever
do
so
.

The
carefully
scripted
red-carpet
ceremony
was
identical
to
the
previous
greeting
for
KMT
Chairman
Lien
Chan
.

The
key
out-come
of
the
meeting
was
the
publication
of
a
shared
political
platform
between
the
Communist
Party
and
Soong
's
People
's
First
Party
.

Finally
,
Soong
lectured
at
Tsinghua
University
,
an
echo
of
Lien
's
lecture
at
Peking
University
four
weeks
prior
.

Soong
's
visit
was
designed
to
emphasize
his
belief
in
common
shared
roots
for
the
Chinese
people
,
a
reflection
of
his
pro-unification
sentiment
.

He
specifically
chose
to
honor
the
historical
ancestor
of
the
Chinese
people
,
the
contemporary
father
of
the
Republic
of
China
,
and
then
his
own
direct
ancestors
in
that
precise
order
.

His
public
comments
addressed
this
continuous
theme
as
well
,
receiving
rapturous
support
from
his
mainland
audience
.

The
political
consensus
borne
of
the
visit
between
the
PFP
and
the
CPC
called
for
practical
actions
towards
establishing
links
between
Taiwan
and
mainland
China
,
while
firmly
resisting
Taiwanese
independence
.

0000
Taipei
Mayoral
Election
On
August
00
,
0000
,
Taiwan
's
Administrative
Supreme
Court
handed
down
a
ruling
against
Soong
in
a
case
of
tax
evasion
.

He
was
charged
gift
taxes
by
the
National
Tax
Administration
from
events
in
0000
when
he
wired
NT$
00
million
from
his
election
campaign
account
to
that
of
his
daughterinlaw
in
the
United
States
.

Soong
's
argument
was
that
he
had
wired
the
money
to
his
daughterinlaw
in
order
to
pay
off
remaining
campaign
debts
and
to
establish
a
Foundation
,
and
that
he
was
not
simply
"
gifting
"
the
money
to
her
.

The
Court
however
found
that
the
first
money
was
not
given
to
the
Foundation
until
December
0000
,
and
ruled
that
the
money
had
been
used
as
his
private
assets
and
that
therefore
gift
tax
was
payable
.

He
was
assessed
NT$
00
million
in
gift
tax
,
with
fine
also
of
NT$
00
million
,
for
a
total
sum
of
NT$
00
million
.

On
Wednesday
October
00
,
0000
Soong
formally
announced
and
registered
his
candidacy
for
the
Mayoralty
of
Taipei
City
,
Taiwan
's
capital
and
largest
city
,
in
the
local
government
elections
to
be
held
in
December
0000
.

Soong
registered
as
a
"
non-partisan
"
candidate
without
a
party
affiliation
,
declaring
that
he
had
taken
a
leave
of
absence
from
his
post
as
Chairman
of
the
PFP
.

After
his
defeat
in
Taipei
Mayoral
Election
on
the
0th
of
December
,
0000
,
he
won
only
0
%
of
cast
ballots
,
James
Soong
announced
that
he
will
retire
from
politics
,
which
entailed
giving
up
the
chairmanship
of
his
party
,
the
PFP
.

With
this
announcement
and
with
no
clear
goal
,
the
PFP
face
an
uncertain
future
which
could
speed
up
any
merger
with
the
Kuomintang
.

Chen
claimed
in
an
interview
with
a
cable
TV
channel
in
May
0000
that
Soong
met
Chen
Yunlin
in
the
United
States
in
February
that
year
.

Following
this
claim
,
on
February
00
,
0000
Taipei
District
Court
ruled
Thursday
that
President
Chen
Shui-bian
must
pay
James
Soong
NT$
0
million
(
US$
00,000
)
in
damages
and
apologize
in
the
top
three
newspapers
for
his
allegation
that
Soong
met
secretly
with
China
's
State
Council
Taiwan
Affairs
Office
Director
Chen
Yunlin
in
0000
.

The
court
said
President
Chen
failed
to
carry
out
necessary
verification
before
making
his
allegation
.
"

The
president
exercises
overall
control
over
the
executive
sector
resources
and
his
responsibility
to
verify
information
must
be
weighted
,
"
a
court
spokesman
said
.

PFP
spokesman
Lee
Hung-Chun
called
the
judgment
"
comforting
"
but
said
it
came
too
late
.
"

It
took
more
than
a
year
for
the
first
judgment
to
come
out
,
"
he
said
,
adding
that
this
meant
the
public
did
not
get
the
chance
to
learn
the
truth
during
a
time
when
the
political
situation
was
changing
rapidly
.

Chen
's
counsel
said
he
will
appeal
to
the
High
Court
.

Claiming
that
his
remarks
were
based
on
"
intelligence
,
"
Chen
also
said
Soong
promised
during
the
meeting
to
oppose
a
proposed
constitutional
amendment
that
would
allow
for
popular
referendums
on
future
constitutional
amendments
,
in
exchange
for
Beijing
's
approval
for
Soong
to
visit
China
.

Soong
filed
a
defamation
suit
against
Chen
in
June
0000
,
demanding
a
symbolic
NT$
0
in
compensation
and
a
published
apology
in
four
major
local
newspapers
for
three
consecutive
days
.

After
Chen
repeated
his
claim
in
another
TV
interview
in
October
that
same
year
.

Soong
later
extended
his
compensation
demand
to
NT$
00
million
and
asked
Chen
to
publish
an
apology
in
four
internationally
famous
newspapers
in
the
United
States
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
France
and
Japan
,
as
well
as
in
three
local
ones
.

According
to
the
written
judgment
,
Chen
said
that
the
intelligence
about
Soong
's
activity
was
submitted
to
him
by
Bureau
of
Investigation
Director-General
Yeh
Cherng-maw
.

However
,
Yeh
told
the
court
that
he
had
warned
Chen
that
the
intelligence
,
some
of
which
he
admitted
was
drawn
from
media
speculation
,
was
difficult
to
check
.

The
judgment
said
that
as
president
,
Chen
must
have
understood
the
weakness
of
the
information
and
could
have
ordered
the
national
security
system
to
conduct
further
verification
,
but
decided
not
to
bother
.

0000
presidential
elections
After
a
petition
,
Soong
,
for
the
first
time
as
a
People
First
Party
presidential
candidate
,
ran
the
0000
presidential
election
together
with
Lin
Ruey-shiung
,
a
National
Taiwan
University
professor
in
public
health
.

Soong
described
the
"
Blue
-
Green
rivalry
"
in
Taiwanese
politics
as
en
epidemic
and
Lin
,
as
a
doctor
,
was
his
partner
to
cure
this
"
disease
"
.

He
contended
that
Taiwanese
people
wanted
a
third
party
other
than
the
KMT
and
the
DDP
,
and
the
PFP
was
their
choice
.

Political
ideology
In
the
middle
of
the
SARS
endemic
in
May
0000
,
he
bashed
the
administration
for
not
being
able
to
participate
in
the
WHO
which
lead
to
the
danger
in
public
health
.

However
,
it
is
China
that
has
steadfastly
opposed
Taiwan
's
participation
in
the
WHO
.

Subsequently
,
he
promised
to
the
public
that
if
elected
,
he
will
push
for
participation
in
WHO
under
the
principle
Under
the
Roof
of
One
China
.

Under
this
principle
,
he
will
not
challenge
the
One
China
policy
set
by
PRC
,
he
added
.

However
,
this
proposal
enhanced
the
public
perception
of
"
selling
out
"
Taiwan
toward
him
and
his
opponents
questioned
how
he
can
protect
Taiwan
's
sovereignty
and
accept
that
Taiwan
be
a
part
of
China
at
the
same
time
.

In
order
to
quelch
this
negative
image
,
Soong
and
his
running
mate
Lien
made
an
unexpected
change
of
direction
in
their
cross
strait
policy
by
announcing
that
they
would
drop
unification
as
the
ultimate
goal
in
their
cross
strait
policy
in
an
international
press
conference
during
the
0000
presidential
election
race
.

They
further
explained
that
they
would
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
final
independence
of
Taiwan
.

However
,
his
opponents
still
cast
a
suspicious
eye
on
Soong
's
true
intentions
.

His
mainland
origins
also
plagued
him
in
the
0000
election
.

Soong
has
been
a
staunch
opponent
of
Taiwan
independence
.

He
publicly
opposed
Taiwanese
language
education
in
his
early
political
life
and
criticized
that
multi-lingual
education
would
lead
to
"
Lebanonization
of
languages
"
and
create
communication
chaos
in
the
nation
.

He
also
criticized
President
Chen
for
staging
a
referendum
.

He
strongly
opposed
the
major
military
weapon
procurement
from
the
US
and
actively
participated
in
the
anti-weapon-purchase
protests
.

He
maintained
the
purchase
would
be
part
of
a
military
race
across
the
strait
and
would
not
enhance
Taiwan
's
ability
in
self-defense
.

He
made
these
claims
while
the
US
government
encouraged
Taiwan
to
procure
the
weapons
for
self-defense
.

His
base
of
support
includes
strong
supporters
of
Chinese
reunification
,
some
rural
voters
(
particularly
in
northern
and
eastern
Taiwan
,
who
were
grateful
for
the
selective
economic
development
undertaken
while
he
was
governor
)
and
some
urban
middle
class
voters
who
see
him
as
a
cleaner
alternative
to
the
KMT
.

Soong
is
well
known
for
using
his
body
language
,
publicly
kneeling
and
shedding
tears
,
as
a
gesture
to
plead
for
constituency
support
.

Though
many
criticize
it
as
false
and
histrionic
,
most
of
Soong
's
supporters
see
it
to
be
candid
and
sincere
.

Among
his
critics
,
Soong
is
widely
seen
as
a
competent
administrator
with
a
sure
popular
touch
,
but
lacking
in
any
serious
political
ideology
and
completely
self-serving
and
corrupt
.

active

Composed
of

,
this
faction
was
in
favour
of

It
accused

of
autocratic
tendencies

Early
life
Born
the
son
of
the
Rev.
Isaac
Stiles
in
North
Haven
,
Connecticut
,
Ezra
Stiles
graduated
from
Yale
in
0000
.

He
studied
theology
and
was
ordained
in
0000
,
tutoring
at
Yale
from
that
year
until
0000
.

He
resigned
from
the
ministry
in
0000
to
study
law
and
practice
at
New
Haven
,
but
returned
to
the
cloth
two
years
later
.

In
0000
,
Stiles
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
the
Society
of
the
Cincinnati
of
Connecticut
,
one
of
the
first
so
honored
,
for
his
ardent
support
of
the
Patriot
cause
.

The
date
was
more
likely
0000
.

There
was
no
Patriot
cause
in
0000
.

He
may
have
been
honored
by
the
Society
but
that
was
n't
created
until
after
the
Revolution
ended
in
honor
of
George
Washington
,
who
imitating
the
famous
Roman
general
went
back
to
farming
after
his
victory
rather
than
declare
himself
dictator
.

Newport
life
Trinity
Church
,
the
Anglican
Church
in
Newport
,
Rhode
Island
,
asked
him
to
become
its
minister
,
but
he
turned
the
offer
down
.

Instead
,
in
0000
,
he
became
pastor
of
the
Second
Congregational
Church
in
Newport
,
Rhode
Island
.

While
in
Newport
,
he
also
served
as
Librarian
of
the
Redwood
Library
and
Athenaeum
and
kept
an
informative
diary
of
his
life
and
distinguished
acquaintances
in
Newport
,
including
his
association
with
Aaron
Lopez
.

The
Ezra
Stiles
House
in
Newport
is
on
the
National
Historic
Register
.

From
time
to
time
,
Stiles
invested
with
the
merchants
and
sea
captains
of
his
congregation
;
in
0000
,
he
sent
a
hogshead
of
rum
along
on
a
voyage
to
Africa
and
was
repaid
with
a
00-year-old
male
slave
,
whom
he
renamed
"
Newport
.
"

Around
the
same
time
,
he
wrote
a
joint
letter
with
fellow
Newport
minister
Samuel
Hopkins
condemning
"
the
great
inhumanity
and
cruelty
"
of
slavery
.

Foundation
of
Brown
University
In
0000
,
Stiles
helped
establish
the
College
in
the
English
Colony
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
(
the
original
name
for
Brown
University
)
by
contributing
to
the
drafting
of
its
charter
and
by
serving
with
00
others
-
including
Stephen
Hopkins
,
William
Ellery
,
Samuel
Ward
,
the
Reverend
John
Gano
,
the
Reverend
Isaac
Backus
,
the
Reverend
Samuel
Stillman
,
and
the
Reverend
James

-
as
a
founding
fellow
or
trustee
.

Biblical
scholarship
Stiles
struck
up
a
close
friendship
with
Rabbi
Haim
Isaac
Carigal
during
the
latter
's
six-month
residence
in
Newport
in
0000
.

Stiles
'
records
note
00
meetings
to
discuss
a
wide
variety
of
topics
from
Kabbalah
to
the
politics
of
the
Holy
Land
.

Stiles
improved
his
rudimentary
knowledge
of
Hebrew
,
to
the
point
where
he
and
Carigal
corresponded
by
mail
in
the
language
.

Stiles
'
knowledge
of
Hebrew
also
enabled
him
to
translate
large
portions
of
the
Hebrew
Old
Testament
into
English
.

Stiles
believed
,
as
did
many
Christian
scholars
of
the
time
,
that
facility
with
the
text
in
its
original
language
was
advantageous
for
proper
interpretation
.

American
Revolution
With
arrival
of
British
troops
in
Newport
in
late
0000
,
Stiles
left
Newport
.

He
became
pastor
of
the
Congregational
Church
at
Portsmouth
,
New
Hampshire
,
in
0000
.

Yale
presidency
In
0000
,
he
was
appointed
president
of
Yale
,
a
post
he
held
until
his
death
.

Stiles
freed
Newport
on
June
0
as
he
prepared
to
move
to
New
Haven
;
he
would
in
0000
hire
his
former
slave
for
$
00
a
year
and
the
indenturing
of
Newport
's
two-year-old
son
until
age
00
.

As
president
of
Yale
,
Stiles
became
its
first
professor
of
Semitic
s
,
and
required
all
students
to
study
Hebrew
(
as
Harvard
students
already
did
)
;
his
first
commencement
address
in
September
0000
(
no
ceremonies
having
been
held
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
)
was
delivered
in
Hebrew
,
Aramaic
,
and
Arabic
.

By
0000
,
however
,
he
was
forced
to
face
failure
in
instilling
an
interest
in
the
language
in
the
student
body
,
writing
The
valedictorian
s
of
0000
and
0000
,
however
,
did
deliver
their
speeches
in
Hebrew
.

Stiles
was
an
amateur
scientist
who
corresponded
with
Thomas
Jefferson
and
Benjamin
Franklin
about
scientific
discoveries
.

Using
equipment
donated
to
the
college
by
Franklin
,
Stiles
conducted
the
first
electrical
experiments
in
New
England
.

His
book
The
United
States
elevated
to
Glory
and
Honor
was
printed
in
0000
.

Legacy
at
Yale
Yale
's
legacy
from
this
interest
of
Stiles
'
includes
a
portrait
of
Carigal
by
artist
Samuel
King
,
and
the
Hebrew
words
"
Urim
"
and
"
Thummim
"
(
אורים
ותמים
)
on
the
Yale
seal
.

In
0000
,
Yale
named
a
new
residential
college
in
his
honor
:
Ezra
Stiles
College
,
noted
for
its
Eero
Saarinen
design
,
particularly
the
building
's
lack
of
right
angles
between
walls
.

The
college
's
mascot
is
the
moose
,
inspired
by
the
installation
in
the
dining
hall
of
a
stuffed
moose
head
in
honor
of
former
college
master
and
Yale
president
A.
Bartlett
Giamatti

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Grant
County
,
and
is
about
a
mile
south
of
John

on
U.S.

History
Canyon
City
was
established
in
June
0000
as
a
result
of
the
discovery
of
gold
in
Canyon
Creek
,
which
flows
through
the
town
.

The
discovery
led
to
land
between
Canyon
City
and
John
Day
being
worth
$
000
per
square
yard
(
$
000/m
²
)
.

Panning
for
gold
could
yield
several
ounces
in
each
pan
of
sediment
.

At
the
peak
of
the
local
gold
rush
,
it
is
claimed
that
00,000
people
lived
in
Canyon
City
,
making
it
larger
than
Portland
at
the
time
.

The
preeminent
geologist
,
Waldemar
Lindgren
,
during
his
0000
visit
to
the
gold
belt
of
the
Blue
Mountains
,
estimated
that
no
more
than
$
00
million
in
gold
had
been
recovered
from
Canyon
Creek
by
then
.

At
the
fixed
value
of
$
00.00
per
troy
ounce
,
this
would
correspond
to
roughly
--
worth
today
(
at
about
$
0,000
an
ounce
)
about
$
0.0
Billion
.

The
town
was
platted
in
0000
and
was
chosen
as
the
county
seat
two
years
later
,
when
Grant
County
was
split
from
Wasco
County
.

It
was
incorporated
in
0000

Canyon
City

been
described

the
"
Deadwood
of
Oregon
"
and
is
the
site

Hill
Cemetery

is
a
city

about
north
of
Canyon
City
in
Grant
County
,
Oregon
,
at
the
intersection
of
U.S.
Routes
00
and

was
named
for
the
nearby
John
Day
River
,
which
had
been
named
for
a
Virginia
n
member
of

History
The
first
homestead
staked
in
Grant
County
(
what
was
then
Wasco
County
)
,
in
0000
by
B.
C.
Trowbridge
,
was
within
the
limits
of
the
present
city
of
John
Day
.

The
Eastern
Oregon
community
was
not
as
quick
to
grow
as
neighboring
Canyon
City
,
which
was
the
county
seat
and
center
of
the
bustling
mining
industry
in
the
area
.

Incrementally
,
local
merchants
and
residents
began
relocating
to
John
Day
—
primarily
each
time
after
severe
fires
in
Canyon
City
:
the
Grant
County
Courthouse
burned
in
0000
,
Chinatown
burned
in
0000
,
and
fires
in
0000
and
0000
devastated
Canyon
City
's
downtown
.

The
first
Post
Office
at
"
John
Day
City
"
was
established
in
0000
,
but
was
discontinued
in
0000
.

It
was
reestablished
in
0000
with
the
name
John
Day
.

In
April
0000
,
a
local
committee
was
elected
,
and
the
Oregon
Legislature
approved
an
Act
incorporating
the
city
of
John
Day
on
February
00
,
0000
.

The
largest
part
of
early
John
Day
was
composed
of
the
Chinese
community
,
commonly
called
Tiger
Town
.

In
0000
,
the
Advent
Christian
Church
in
John
Day
had
000
members
,
000
of
whom
were
Chinese
(
and
a
number
of
Chinese
residents
were
interred
in
the
Seventh
Day
Adventist
Cemetery
)
.

By
0000
,
John
Day
was
home
to
nearly
0000
Chinese
immigrants
,
who
had
been
attracted
to
the
area
by
a
gold
rush
twenty
years
earlier
,
many
of
whom
were
displaced
by
the
0000
fire
in
Canyon
City
.

A
trading
post
built
in
the
area
in
the
0000s
along
The
Dalles
Military
Road
was
purchased
in
0000
by
two
Chinese
immigrants
,
Lung
On
and
Ing
Hay
.

They
converted
the
trading
post
into
a
clinic
,
general
store
,
and
social
center
for
the
community
,
which
continued
to
operate
until
the
0000s
.

In
the
0000s
the
building
,
then
the
property
of
the
city
of
John
Day
,
was
converted
into
a
museum
called
the
Kam
Wah
Chung
&
Co.
.
Museum
.

It
is
now
operated
in
conjunction
with
the
Oregon
Parks
and
Recreation
Department
and
is
one
of
the
premier
surviving
examples
of
a
nineteenth
century
Chinese
apothecary
shop
.

It
was
designated
a
National
Historic
Landmark
in
0000
.

Geography
John
Day
is
located
at
an
elevation
of
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

John
Day
is
surrounded
by

Strawberry
Mountains
to

.

Geology
The
bedrock
geology
of
the
John
Day
area
is
a
complex
assemblage
of
Permian
to
Triassic
age
metamorphic
and
igneous
rocks
which
were
added
to
the
western
North
American
continental
margin
by
tectonic
activity
in
the
Triassic
and
Jurassic
Periods
.

Cenozoic
age
volcanic
rocks
related
to
the
long-lived
Columbia
River
Basalt
emplacement
were
deposited
above
these
bedrock
units
.

The
area
around
John
Day
contains
some
of
the
most
important
paleontological
resources
known
.

From
about
the
time
the
dinosaurs
disappeared
right
up
until
the
Pleistocene
,
the
region
was
subjected
to
significant
volcanism
and
other
processes
that
preserved
fossils
.

Because
the
matrix
in
which
the
fossils
are
entombed
is
datable
,
the
fossils
themselves
can
be
dated
with
excellent
precision
.

This
gives
paleontologists
the
ability
to
study
how
species
changed
over
time
and
also
how
the
relationship
between
ecosystems
and
climate
changed
.

Spanish
explorers
in
the
00th
Century
reportedly
explored
the
area
for
gold
,
but
none
was
found
.

Seneca
is
a
city
in
Grant
County
,
Oregon
,
United

.

It
is
located
in
the
Blue
Mountains
about
south

Pine
logs
from

town
was
incorporated
as

control
began
to
wane
.

Hörby
Municipality
(
Hörby
kommun
)
is
a
municipality
in
the
central
part
of
Skåne
County
in
southern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
the
town
of
Hörby
.

The
present
municipality
consists
of
ten
original
entities
merged
to
each
other
in

Geography
The
geography
is
varied
with
a
few
forests
,
some
lakes
and
streams
and
farmland
and
even
wildlife
.

Horby
is
one
of
the
most
meadow-filled
municipalities
in
Sweden
.

History
Some
historians
claim
Hörby
was
founded
in
the
0th
century
A.D.
,
but
the
truth
is
that
no
one
knows
exactly
how
old
the
village
is
.

During
the
Middle
Ages
Hörby
evolved
into
a
centre
of
commerce
,
much
due
to
its
location
,
right
in
the
middle
of
Skåne
.

The
name
"
Hörby
"
comes
from
the
old
word
"
horg
"
which
today
would
translate
into
"
barrow
"
or
"
mound
"
.

As
the
name
hints
the
woods
surrounding
Hörby
are
filled
with
old
burial
mounds
(
some
dating
back
to
the
Bronze
Age
)
and
also
some
old
cult
places
from
the
pre-Christian
religion
of
asatru
.

The
same
word
has
given
name
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
Höör
.

Loclities
There
are
0

Culture
Hörby
Municipality
still
has
much
of
the
old
cultural
heritage
remaining
in
the
villages
.

Hörby
is
famous
for
being
one
of
the
transmitting
stations
specified
on
old
MF
radio
receivers
.

The
broadcasting
signals
(
radio
,
TV
)
are
still
transmitted
from
the
Teracom
transmitting
station
in
Östra
Sallerup
,
0
km
south
of
the
town
of
Hörby
.

MF
transmissions
do
not
occur
from
Hörby
any
more
,
but
from
the
new
transmitter
in
Sölvesborg
,
inaugurated
in
0000
,
at
the
coast
of
the
Baltic
Sea
.

On
the
first
Thursday
in
July
every
year
since
0000
,
the
Hörby
Market
(
Hörby
Marknad
)
is
held
.

It
attracts
thousands
of
visitors
and
is
one
of
the
three
main
traditional
markets
in
Skåne
together
with
the
markets
of
Kivik
and
Sjöbo
.

The
most
famous
personality
from
Hörby
was
the

Burns
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Harney
County
,
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Oregon
.

According
to
the
0000
census
,
the
population
was
0,000
.

Burns
and
the
nearby
city
of
Hines
are
home
to
about
00
percent
of
the
people
in
the
sparsely
populated
county
,
the
largest
in
Oregon
and
the
ninth
largest
in
the
United
States
.

The
Burns
–
Hines
region
has
a
high-desert
climate
but
was
much
wetter
in
the
recent
geologic
past
.

The
Harney
Basin
was
the
largest
of
many
depressions
in
which
lakes
formed
in
southeastern
Oregon
during
the
late
Pleistocene
.

Remnants
of
an
ancient
lake
that
reached
as
far
north
as
Burns
are
at
the
center
of
the
Malheur
National
Wildlife
Refuge
,
south
of
the
city
.

Northern
Paiutes
or
their
ancestors
,
who
were
hunter-gatherer
s
,
have
lived
in
the
region
for
thousands
of
years
.

Since
the
arrival
of
Euro-Americans
in
the
00th
century
,
cattle
ranching
and
other
forms
of
agriculture
have
dominated
land
use
in
the
area
.

In
0000
,
logging
in
the
mountains
north
of
Burns
led
to
the
creation
of
Hines
,
a
lumber
company
town
,
and
the
timber
industry
remained
important
to
the
local
economy
until
the
0000s
.

In
addition
to
ranching
,
a
variety
of
private
and
public
enterprises
support
the
Burns
–
Hines
economy
in
the
00st
century
.

Annual
events
include
a
migratory
bird
festival
,
the
county
fair
,
and
a
country
music
jamboree
.

Geology
Burns
is
in
southeastern
Oregon
near
the
northern
edge
of
the
arid
Harney
Basin
.

The
basin
is
part
of
the
High
Lava
Plains
,
a
region
dominated
by
erupting
volcanoes
in
the
late
Miocene
,
five
to
ten
million
years
ago
.

Centered
on
the
Brothers
Fault
Zone
,
which
runs
southeast
–
northwest
between
Steens
Mountain
and
Bend
,
the
High
Lava
Plains
merge
with
the
Blue
Mountains
to
the
north
and
the
Basin
and
Range
Province
to
the
south
.

Shallow
basins
formed
by
crustal
stretching
in
the
Basin
and
Range
province
were
much
wetter
during
the
late
Pleistocene
,
up
to
00,000
years
ago
,
than
they
are
in
the
00st
century
.

Lakes
formed
in
these
basins
,
including
those
in
the
southern
part
of
the
High
Lava
Plains
.

Among
these
,
the
largest
depression
was
the
Harney
Basin
,
covering

Within
the
Harney
Basin
,
ancient
Malheur
Lake
—
the
00st-century
remnants
of
which
include
Malheur
Lake
,
Harney
Lake
,
and
Mud
Lake
—
covered
and
extended
as
far
north
as
Burns
.

These
remnant
wetlands
have
become
the
Malheur
National
Wildlife
Refuge
.

Geography
Harney
County
is
the
largest
county
in
Oregon
and
the
ninth
largest
in
the
United
States
.

It
covers
about
but
has
a
total
population
of
only
about
0,000
.

Most
of
that
population
lives
in
Burns
or
Hines
,
about
southwest
of
Burns
.

Burns
had
about
0,000
residents
in

and
Hines
about
0,000
,
for
a
total
of
0,000
,
nearly

percent
of
the
county
population
.

The
city
is
east
of
Bend
,
and
west
of
Ontario
,
Oregon
,
on
U.S.
Route

at
its
intersection
with

History
Tribal
Archeologists
have
found
evidence
of
human
habitation
in
the
general
vicinity
of
Burns
as
early
as
00,000
years
ago
.

Members
of
the
contemporary
Burns
Paiute
Tribe
of
Harney
County
descended
mainly
from
the
Wadatika
band
of
Paiutes
,
hunter-gatherers
of
central
and
southern
Oregon
.

The
Wadatikas
were
named
after
the
wada
seeds
collected
as
food
from
near
Malheur
Lake
.

Their
territory
covered
about
from
the
Cascade
Range
to
near
Boise
and
from
the
southern
Blue
Mountains
to
south
of
Steens
Mountain
.

Scattered
in
the
00th
century
by
clashes
with
white
settlers
and
soldiers
and
through
forced
removal
to
distant
reservations
,
some
of
the
Paiutes
eventually
returned
to
Harney
County
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
Burns
Paiute
Tribe
began
buying
land
near
Burns
and
holding
tribal
elections
.

By
the
late
0000s
,
the
tribe
had
adopted
a
constitution
and
tribal
bylaws
,
and
in
0000
the
Burns
Paiute
formally
became
an
independent
tribe
,
eligible
to
enter
into
contracts
with
other
governments
and
legal
entities
.

The
tribe
owns
the
Burns
Paiute
Reservation
,
north
of
Burns
,
and
individual
members
of
the
tribe
own
more
than
of
land
elsewhere
in
the
county
.

As
of
0000
,
the
tribe
had
about
000
members
,
and
about
000
lived
on
the
reservation
.

Cities
and
ranches
After
the
arrival
of
Euro-American
settlers
in
the
00th
century
,
Burns
was
established
in
the
0000s
.

It
was
formally
incorporated
after
Harney
County
's
creation
in
0000
through
the
splitting
of
Grant
County
into
two
counties
.

Early
settler
,
merchant
,
and
county
commissioner
George
McGowan
named
the
city
after
the
Scottish
poet
Robert
Burns
.

By
0000
,
the
community
had
stores
,
a
post
office
,
hotels
,
and
other
businesses
.

McGowan
was
the
town
's
first
postmaster
.

In
the
0000s
,
timber
cutting
and
milling
brought
many
newcomers
to
the
region
.

In
0000
,
the
Edward
Hines
Lumber
Company
acquired
from
the
U.S.
Forest
Service
the
rights
to
cut
timber
in
the
Blue
Mountains
near
Seneca
,
north
of
Burns
.

After
winning
the
timber
contract
,
the
Hines
Company
built
the
Oregon
and
Northwestern
Railroad
between
Burns
and
Seneca
.

Edward
Hines
,
the
company
owner
,
built
a
lumber
mill
and
company
town
,
incorporated
as
the
City
of
Hines
in
0000
.

Timber
and
logging
remained
important
to
the
local
economy
until
the
0000s
,
when
the
area
's
last
lumber
mill
closed
for
lack
of
timber
.

Cattle
ranching
in
the
region
began
as
early
as
the
0000s
and
expanded
after
passage
of
the
Desert
Land
Act
of
0000
.

The
act
promoted
development
of
arid
and
semi-arid
public
land
in
the
western
United
States
by
making
plots
available
to
individuals
willing
to
"
reclaim
,
irrigate
,
and
cultivate
"
the
land
.

Some
of
the
Harney
County
ranches
established
in
the
00th
century
still
exist
in
the
00st
.

Agricultural
revenue
for
Harney
County
in
0000
totaled
about
$
00
million
.

Of
this
,
about
00
percent
came
from
cattle
sales
,
00
percent
from
the
sale
of
alfalfa
hay
,
and
most
of
the
rest
from
other
crops
and
the
sale
of
horses
.

County
in
southern
Sweden
,
about
00
km
north
of

.

Its
seat
is
located
in

.

The
present
municipality

of
the
market
town

and
the
rural
municipality

.

It
took
place
in
0000
,
between
the
two
nation-wide
local
government
reforms
of
0000
and
0000
.

Geography
The
small
municipality
borders
to
Kävlinge
Municipality
,
Burlöv
Municipality
,
Staffanstorp
Municipality
and
Lund
Municipality
.

As
Burlöv
also
is
notably
small
,
Lomma
Municipality
almost
borders
to
Malmö
Municipality
too
.

It
is
situated
by
Öresund
,
at
the
inlet
of
the
small
river
Höje
å
.

Along
the
river
lies
a
yacht
marina
.

In
the
old
industrial
area
along
the
river
new
appartements
and
villas
are
erected
,
with
some
facing
the
river
or
the
beach
.

The
beaches
along
its
coasts
also
attract
visitors
from
other
municipalities
;
Lomma
Municipality
's
beaches
are
the
principal
beaches
for
people
from
the
beach-less
Lund
.

00
km
to
the
north-east
is
the
university
city
of
Lund
,
with
some
00,000
inhabitants
,
about
the
same
distance
as
to
Malmö
(
with
its
000,000
inhabitants
)
to
the
south
.

Lomma
Municipality
is
also
considered
part
of
Metropolitan
Malmö
,
showing
itself
for
instance
by
the
0,000
commuters
that
live
in
there
.

Travelling
to
and
from
Lomma
Municipality
is
easy
,
as
a
main
highway
actually
passes
straight
through
the
town
of
Lomma
,
connecting
with
Lund
and
Malmö
,
and
with
other
cities
to
the
north
.

Geologically
,
its
terrain
is
almost
completely
flat
levelled
,
which
is
the
custom
for
south-western
Skåne
as
a
whole
.

The
highest
location
in
Lomma
Municipality
is
00
meters
above
sea
level
.

History
The
area
where
Lomma
Municipality
is
now
is
located
between
two
small
rivers
,
and
was
inhabited
by
hunters
in
the
Stone
Age
.

The
name
Lomma
can
be
traced
to
0000
,
and
in
the
ensuing
centuries
it
established
some
wealth
thanks
to
merchancy
with
the
episcopal
see
in
Lund
.

Nonetheless
,
the
area
was
only
a
village
until
Sweden
's
first
cement
works
was
established
in
0000
.

The
ground
consists
of
a
certain
clay
stemming
from
the
last
ice
age
,
and
is
available
in
large
quantities
in
Lomma
Municipality
.

A
fully
fledged
industry
was
started
in
the
0000s
,
and
by
the
end
of
the
century
Lomma
Municipality
had
five
brick
factories
.

The
bricks
from
Lomma
are
yellow
of
appearance
and
were
regarded
as
the
highest
kind
of
bricks
during
that
century
.

One
church
built
with
those
bricks
is
the
church
in
Lomma
,
(
Lomma
kyrka
)
,
a
large
neo
Gothic
church
that
was
finished
in
the
0000s
.

The
coat
of
arms
depicts
an
anchor
-
showing
the
importance
of
the
harbour
-
and
a
brick
wall
,
indicating
that
Lomma
Municipality
once
actually
had
city
rights
as
well
as
its
brick
industry
.

Refugee
controversy
Sjöbo
Municipality
reached
the
public
eye
in
Sweden
in
0000
when
,
under
the
leadership
of
the
Municipal
Commissioner
Sven-Olle
Olsson
,
it
voted
by
a
majority
of
00
%
in
a
referendum
that
it
would
not
accept
foreign
asylum
seeker
s.
Most
other
municipalities
in
Sweden
accepted
refugees
that
came
from
troubled
countries
such
as
former
Yugoslavia
and
Iraq
.

In
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
,
immigration
,
high
unemployment
and
the
fiscal
burdens
on
local
governments
who
were
obliged
to
integrate
refugees
,
and
the
influence
of
Sjöbo
Municipality
's
refusal
to
accept
refugees
in
0000
,
led
to
the
adoption
of
a
combined
immigration
and
integration
system
in
the
"
Aliens
Act
"
of
0000
.

Geography
The
town
of
Sjöbo
has
flat
terrain
,

straight
streets
stretching

,
leading

larger
roads
.

The
northwestern
part
of
the
municipality
includes
the
main
part
of
Vombsjön
,
the
largest
lake
of
southern
Scania
and
notable
for
being
the
water
source
of
Malmö
.

Some
parts
of
the
lake
belong
to
Lund
Municipality
.

It
offers
fishing
for
European
perch
,
pike
,
pikeperch
and
eel
.

Activities
There
are
at
least
five
(
largely
)
authentic
medieval
churches

century
in
the
municipality
(
in
Södra
Åsum
,
Tolånga
,
Björka
,
Blentarp
and

)
.

They
are
notable

not
having
undergone
the
severe
restorations
that
many
other
churches
in
Scania
suffered
once
the
population
began
growing
in
the
second
half
of
the
00th
century
and
Helgo
Zetterwall
was
hired
to
expand
on
them
.

Frescos
which
adorned
the
apse
of
Södra
Åsum
church
and
the
ceilings
of
the
churches
in
Everlöv
and
Illstrop
centuries
ago
have
been
slowly
uncovered
in
recent
years
.

Many
similar
churches
had
their
ornamentation
stripped
and
their
paintings
plastered
over
as
part
of
the
iconoclasm
of
Sweden
's
adoption
of
Lutheranism
.

Apart
from
religious
activities
,
there
is
the
annual
festival
Sjöbo

It
has

Östra

Municipality
(

is
a
municipality
in
Skåne
County
in
southern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
Broby

The

in
0000
when
the
former
municipalities
of

where
approximately

,
surrounded
by
sparsely

rural
areas
.

Geography
Östra
Göinge
Municipality
is
part
of
Göinge
bygden
,
an
area
in
northern
Scania
which
borders
the
provinces
Småland
and
Blekinge
.

The
landscape
is
gently
undulating
and
densely
forested
with
deciduous
and
coniferous
trees
,
interspersed
with
open
areas
of
flat
and
fertile
agricultural
land
.

Even
though
this
is
a
typical
northern
Scanian
landscape
,
Östra
Göinge
's
abundance
of
small
forest
tarns
,
winding
brooks
and
large
lakes
make
it
similar
to
the
province
Småland
as
well
.

The
large
,
scenic
river
Helgeån
runs
through
the
municipality
,
offering
ample
opportunities
for
fishing
of
pike
,
perch
and
pike-perch
,
as
well
as
brown
trout
,
eel
,
whitefish
and
chub
.

History
The
Snapphane
,
Scanian
resistance
fighters
of
00th
century
,
took
refuge
in
the
forests
of
Östra
Göinge
.

Considered
rebels
and
bandits
by
the
Swedish
army
,
the
Snapphanar
were
protected
by
the
local
population
and
their
bravery
is
still
cherished
in
the
municipality
.

All
of
Göingebygden
endured
hardship
and
suffered
devastation
during
the
times
after
the
Treaty
of
Roskilde
in
0000
,
during
Scania
's
transition
from
being
a
Danish
to
becoming
a
Swedish
ruled
territory
.

The
dialect
of
Göingebygden
has
historically
been
distinguishable
from
the
southern
Scanian
dialects
as
well
as
the
northern
Småland
dialects
,
perhaps
because
the
population
took
pride
in
the
area
's
historical
autonomy
and
resilient
resistance
.

Industry
A
famous
,
very
fine-grained
black
diabase
is
mined
in
Östra
Göinge
.

Because
of
the
extremely
high
quality
of
the
diabase
from
this
area
,
it
is
in
high
demand
worldwide
and
has
become
popular
with
artists
all
over
the
globe
,
one
of
the
more
well-known
being
Takashi
Naraha
from
Japan
.

It
is
primarily
used
for
gravestones
,
monuments
,
sculptures
,
and
other
forms
of
stone
artworks
,
but
also
to
decorate
buildings
.

The

The
Taiwan
Solidarity
Union
(
TSU
;
)
is
a
political
party
in
Taiwan
which
advocates
Taiwan
independence
.

It
was
officially
founded
on
July
00
,
0000
and
is
considered
part
of
the
Pan-Green
Coalition
.

Unlike
the
Democratic
Progressive
Party
,
its
larger
companion
party
in
the
Pan-Green
Coalition
,
the
TSU
actively
campaigns
for
the
creation
of
a
de
jure
Republic
of
Taiwan
.

The
party
prided
itself
on
being
the
first
to
include
"
Taiwan
"
.

In
the
summer
of
0000
,
supporters
of
former
ROC
president
Lee
Teng-hui
formed
the
Taiwan
Solidarity
Union
.

In
the
0000
presidential
elections
,
the
Kuomintang
(
KMT
)
suffered
a
devastating
defeat
,
in
which
internal
turmoil
had
caused
the
party
to
lose
its
grip
on
power
.

This
was
blamed
on
Lee
,
the
KMT
Chairman
at
the
time
,
and
he
was
forced
to
resign
in
March
0000
.

The
hardliners
in
the
KMT
and
recently
expelled
supporters
of
James
Soong
believed
Lee
secretly
harbored
support
for
Taiwan
independence
and
had
purposely
sabotaged
the
KMT
(
by
not
allowing
Soong
to
run
under
the
KMT
)
in
order
to
allow
Chen
Shui-bian
,
the
Democratic
Progressive
Party
candidate
,
to
win
.

Meanwhile
,
after
winning
the
presidential
election
,
Chen
Shui-bian
moderated
his
pro-independence
position
,
alienating
some
hardline
independence
supporters
in
the
Democratic
Progressive
Party
.

By
July
,
just
months
before
the
December
0000
elections
to
the
Legislative
Yuan
,
these
factors
accumulated
to
result
in
the
formation
of
the
TSU
to
continue
Lee
's
policies
,
and
fill
the
void
in
Taiwanese
politics
caused
by
the
DPP
's
abandonment
of
its
strongly
pro-independence
political
stance
.

It
was
hoped
that
this
would
lead
to
a
pan-green
majority
in
the
nation
's
primary
legislative
body
,
thus
giving
the
executive
branch
,
under
Chen
,
the
political
backing
necessary
to
pursue
policies
supportive
of
Taiwanese
independence
.

The
TSU
's
stated
political
aim
is
the
advocacy
of
the
creation
of
a
Republic
of
Taiwan
and
a
policy
of
desinicization
which
consists
of
eliminating
the
symbols
and
concepts
which
connect
Taiwan
to
the
idea
of
China
.

The
TSU
argues
that
any
lingering
connection
with
the
concept
of
China
renders
Taiwan
an
"
abnormal
nation
"
and
that
clearly
separating
Taiwan
from
China
is
necessary
to
prevent
Taiwan
from
being
dominated
by
an
enemy
and
foreign
nation
.

The
TSU
has
also
strongly
advocated
the
creation
of
a
new
constitution
for
Taiwan
and
abandonment
of
the
Republic
of
China
as
Taiwan
's
formal
name
.

Lee
was
,
naturally
,
identified
as
the
"
spiritual
leader
"
(
though
he
personally
never
joined
the
party
)
;
the
TSU
hoped
that
Lee
's
popularity
would
help
the
TSU
make
the
0
%
support
mark
.

Further
,
Lee
's
dominance
in
the
party
was
revealed
when
the
candidates
TSU
nominated
had
all
been
personally
approved
by
Lee
beforehand
.

Meanwhile
,
as
Lee
's
actions
increasingly
departed
from
the
KMT
's
unificationist
positions
,
he
was
eventually
expelled
from
the
Kuomintang
.

Although
there
was
some
initial
speculation
that
Lee
's
expulsion
would
cause
mass
defections
in
the
Kuomintang
,
none
of
the
major
Kuomintang
leaders
or
Lee
's
close
associates
changed
sides
.

Nonetheless
,
former
members
of
the
KMT
were
still
to
be
the
fundamental
building
blocks
of
the
new
party
,
with
half
of
TSU
candidates
coming
directly
from
the
KMT
.

After
winning
nine
seats
in
the
000-member
Legislative
Yuan
in
December
0000
,
the
TSU
has
largely
displaced
the
Taiwan
Independence
Party
(
TAIP
)
as
the
strongly
pro-Taiwan-independence
political
force
and
the
TSU
legislators
began
advocating
relevant
resolutions
.

For
instance
,
they
have
opened
the
debates
about
changing
the
national
flag
and
national
anthem
.

In
the
0000
Republic
of
China
municipal
elections
in
Taipei
and
Kaohsiung
,
TSU
fielded
no
mayoral
candidate
,
and
it
suffered
a
defeat
in
winning
no
seats
in
the
Taipei
City
council
and
won
only
two
seats
in
the
Kaohsiung
City
council
.

Yasukuni
Shrine
visit
The
visit
to
the
Yasukuni
Shrine
by
TSU
chairman
Shu
Chin-chiang
(
蘇進強
)
in
April
0000
generated
a
controversy
across
the
political
spectrum
and
further
made
their
party
goals
more
ambiguous
to
the
voters
.

However
,
the
TSU
has
made
it
clear
that
it
would
achieve
its
goal
of
total
independence
by
all
means
.

Chairman
Shu
denied
the
visit
should
be
seen
as
support
for
militarism
,
and
claimed
it
was
a
goodwill
gesture
to
Taiwan
's
former
colonial
master
Japan
to
further
strengthen
the
security
of
the
Pacific
region
.

Chairman
Su
also
emphasized
that
there
is
a
need
to
remind
the
Taiwanese
public
that
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
is
aiming
000
missiles
towards
Taiwan
and
that
Japan
would
be
an
important
ally
if
China
were
inclined
to
invade
.

Chairman
Shu
's
visit
,
however
,
gave
opportunity
to
aboriginal
legislator
Kao
Chin
Su-mei
(
高金素梅
)
to
gain
publicity
by
protesting
with
her
supporters
at
the
chairman
's
arrival
at
the
Chiang
Kai-Shek
International
Airport
,
now
renamed
Taiwan
Taoyuan
International
Airport
.

Later
on
the
TSU
press
conference
was
disrupted
by
an
angry
mob
from
the
members
of
pro-unification
Patriot
Association
(
愛國同心會
)
,
who
showed
their
disagreement
and
dissatisfaction
by
throwing
eggs
at
the
conference
building
.

The
Democratic
Progressive
Party
,
the
ruling
party
,
kept
a
low
profile
in
this
controversy
and
attempts
to
distance
itself
from
the
incident
.

Current
status
The
TSU
suffered
defeat
in
the
December
0000
local
elections
,
along
with
its
pan-green
partner
the
DPP
,
and
failed
to
win
any
municipal
mayoral
or
county
magistrate
seats
.

Its
representation
in
the
Legislative
Yuan
was
eliminated
by
the
0000
election
when
it
failed
to
win
any
district-contested
seats
and
failed
to
gain
the
0
%
threshold
for
proportional
representation
.

In
the
0000
legislative
elections
,
the
TSU
won
0.00
%
of
the
popular
vote
and
earned
three
representatives
to
the
Legislative
Yuan
,
renewing
its
status
as
a
credible
third
party
in
Taiwanese
government
.

The
Taiwan
Independence
Party
建國黨
(
TAIP
)
,
otherwise
known
as
the
Taiwan
Nation
Party
,
is
a
political
party
in
the
Republic
of
China
(
Taiwan
)
.

It
is
usually
associated
with
the
Pan-Green
Coalition
and
supports
Taiwan
independence
.

Disappointed
by
the
Democratic
Progressive
Party
's
(
DPP
)
gradual
moderation
of
its
support
of
Taiwan
independence
,
some
DPP
members
,
many
connected
to
Peng
Ming-min
's
"
Nation
Building
Association
"
formed
the
Taiwan
Independence
Party
in
0000
.

However
,
the
party
has
failed
to
win
large-scale
support
,
due
to
the
lack
of
organizational
skills
and
internal
disagreements
.

It
has
largely
been
displaced
as
Taiwan
's
ideological
independence
party
by
the
newly
formed
Taiwan

Union
(

Jacksonville
is
a
city
in
Jackson
County
,

,
about
west
of

Creek

site
of
one
of

first
placer

claims
in

Historic
District
which
was

Historic
Landmark
in

As

History
Jacksonville
was
founded
following
discovery
of
gold
deposits
in
0000
–
0000
.

With
the
creation
of
Jackson
County
,
it
became
the
county
seat
,
a
role
which
was
transferred
to
nearby
Medford
in
0000
.

Jacksonville
was
home
to
the
first
Chinatown
in
Oregon
,
founded
by
immigrants
from
San
Francisco
,
California
.

Evidence
of
this
chapter
of
history
was
uncovered
early
in
March
0000
when
road
work
uncovered
artifacts
dating
to
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Construction
was
halted
while
archeologists
performed
four
days
of
rescue
excavations
.

Their
findings
included
broken
Chinese
bowls
and
tea
cups
,
handmade
bottles
,
and
fragments
of
opium
paraphernalia
and
Chinese
coins
.

When
the
gold
deposits
were
worked
out
,
and
the
railway
bypassed
Jacksonville
in
0000
,
the
city
's
economy
slowed
.

This
had
the
unintended
benefit
of
preserving
a
number
of
structures
,
which
led
to
Jacksonville
being
designated
a
National
Historic
District
in
0000
,
covering
over
000
buildings
.

It
was
cited
as
a
"
mid-00th
century
inland
commercial
city
significant
for
its
magnificent
group
of
surviving
unaltered
commercial
and
residential
buildings
.

The
city
was
the
principal
financial
center
of
southern
Oregon
until

was
bypassed
by

Medford
is
a
city
in
Jackson
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

As
of
July
0
,
0000
,
the
city
had
a
total
population
of
00,000
and
a
metropolitan
area
population
of
000,000
,
making
the
Medford
MSA
the
0th
largest
metro
area
in
Oregon
.

The
city
was
named
in
0000
by
David
Loring
,
civil
engineer
and
right-of-way
agent
for
the
Oregon
and
California
Railroad
for
his
home
town
of
Medford
,
Massachusetts
and
in
recognition
of
its
supposed
position
on
the
middle
ford
of
Bear
Creek
.

Medford
is
the
county
seat
of
Jackson
County
.

History
In
0000
,
a
group
of
railroad
surveyors
headed
by
S.
L.
Dolson
and
David
Loring
arrived
in
Rock
Point
,
near
present
day
Gold
Hill
.

They
were
charged
with
finding
the
best
route
through
the
Rogue
Valley
for
the
Oregon
and
California
Railroad
.

Citizens
of
neighboring
Jacksonville
hoped
that
it
would
pass
between
their
town
and
Hanley
Butte
,
near
the
present
day
Claire
Hanley
Arboretum
.

Such
a
move
would
have
all
but
guaranteed
prosperous
growth
for
Jacksonville
,
but
Dolson
decided
instead
to
stake
the
railroad
closer
to
Bear
Creek
.

The
response
from
Jacksonville
was
mixed
,
but
the
decision
was
final
.

By
November
0000
,
a
depot
site
had
been
chosen
and
a
surveying
team
led
by
Charles
J.
Howard
was
hard
at
work
platting
the
new
town
.

They
completed
their
work
in
early
December
0000
,
laying
out
00
blocks
for
development
.

James
Sullivan
Howard
,
a
New
Hampshire
Freemason
,
claimed
to
have
built
the
town
's
first
building
in
January
0000
,
though
blacksmith
Emil
Piel
was
advertising
for
business
at
the
"
central
depot
"
in
the
middle
of
December
.

Others
point
out
the
farms
of
town
founders
Iradell
Judson
Phipps
and
Charles
Wesley
Broback
,
which
were
present
before
the
town
was
platted
.

Regardless
,
on
February
0
,
0000
(
less
than
a
month
after
it
was
built
)
,
J.
S.
Howard
's
store
became
Medford
's
first
post
office
,
with
Howard
serving
as
postmaster
.

The
establishment
of
the
post
office
led
to
the
incorporation
of
the
Medford
as
a
town
by
the
Oregon
Legislative
Assembly
on
February
00
,
0000
,
and
again
as
a
city
in
0000
.

Howard
held
the
position
of
postmaster
for
Medford
's
first
ten
years
,
and
again
held
the
post
upon
his
death
on
November
00
,
0000
.

The
beginning
of
the
00th
century
was
a
transitional
period
.

Medford
built
a
new
steel
bridge
over
Bear
Creek
to
replace
an
earlier
one
which
washed
away
three
years
before
.

Without
a
bridge
,
those
wanting
to
cross
had
to
ford
the
stream
,
typically
using
a
horse-drawn
wagon
;
the
first
automobile
did
not
arrive
in
Medford
until
0000
.

Pharmacist
George
H.
Haskins
had
opened
a
drugstore
just
after
the
town
was
platted
,
and
in
0000
he
allowed
the
Medford
Library
Association
to
open
a
small
library
in
that
store
.

Five
years
later
the
library
moved
to
Medford
's
new
city
hall
,
in
another
four
years
,
Andrew
Carnegie
's
donation
allowed
a
dedicated
library
to
be
built
.

Construction
on
the
Medford
Carnegie
Library
was
completed
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Medford
took
the
title
of
county
seat
of
Jackson
County
away
from
nearby
Jacksonville
.

In
0000
,
Interstate
0
was
completed
immediately
adjacent
to
downtown
Medford
to
replace
the
Oregon
Pacific
Highway
.

It
has
been
blamed
for
the
decline
of
small
businesses
in
downtown
Medford
since
its
completion
,
but
nevertheless
remains
an
important
route
for
commuters
wishing
to
travel
across
the
city
.

In
fact
,
a
study
completed
in
0000
found
that
00
%
of
vehicles
entering
I-0
from
north
Medford
heading
south
exited
in
south
Medford
,
just
three
miles
(
0
km
)
away
.

The
high
volume
of
traffic
on
Interstate
0
led
to
the
completion
of
a
new
north
Medford
interchange
in
0000
.

The
project
,
which
cost
about
$
00
million
,
improved
traffic
flow
between
I-0
and
Crater
Lake
Highway
.

Further
traffic
problems
identified
in
south
Medford
prompted
the
construction
of
another
new
interchange
,
costing
$
00
million
.

The
project
began
in
0000
and
was
completed
in
0000
.

Since
the
0000s
,
Medford
has
dedicated
an
appreciable
amount
of
resources
to
urban
renewal
in
an
attempt
to
revitalize
the
downtown
area
.

Several
old
buildings
have
been
restored
,
including
the
Craterian
Ginger
Rogers
Theater
and
the
Prohibition
era
Cooley-Neff
Warehouse
,
now
operating
as
Pallet
Wine
Company
,
an
urban
winery
.

Streets
have
been
realigned
,
new
sidewalks
,
traffic
signals
,
and
bicycle
lanes
were
installed
,
and
two
new
parking
garages
have
been
built
.

Downtown
Medford
also
received
a
new
library
building
to
replace
the
historic
Medford
Carnegie
Library
and
now
boasts
satellite
campuses
for
both
Rogue
Community
College
and
Southern
Oregon
University
.

Economic
problems
in
0000
and
0000
put
a
hold
on
The
Commons
project
,
a
collaboration
between
the
city
of
Medford
and
Lithia

.

The

,
one

Climate
Medford
sits
in
a
rain
shadow
between
the
Cascade
Range
and
Siskiyou
Mountains
called
the
Rogue
Valley
.

As
such
,
most
of
the
rain
associated
with
the
Pacific
Northwest
and
Oregon
in
particular
skips
Medford
,
making
it
drier
and
sunnier
than
the
Willamette
Valley
.

Medford
's
climate
is
considerably
warmer
,
both
in
summer
and
winter
,
than
its
latitude
would
suggest
,
with
a
Mediterranean
climate
(
Köppen
Csa
)
.

Summers
are
akin
to
Eastern

,
and
winters
resemble

which
during
its
lumber
mill
days
produced
fog
so
thick
that
visibility
could
be
reduced
to
less
than
five
feet
.

These
inversions
can
last
for
weeks
;
some
suggest
this
is
because
the
metropolitan
area
has
one
of
the
lowest
average
wind
speeds
of
all
American
metropolitan
areas
.

Medford
residents
do
experience

to
Oregon
's
0rd
busiest
airport
,
the
Rogue
Valley
International-Medford
Airport
(
airport
code
MFR
)
.

000,000
people
used
this
regional
airport
in
0000
,
which
has
served
over
00
million
passengers
between

,
And
Allegiant
air
.

With
expansion
of
the
airport
terminal
underway
,
the
facilities
are
quickly
being
upgraded
.

Bus
The
greater
Medford
metro
area
has
been
served
by
Rogue
Valley
Transportation
District
(
RVTD
)
since
0000
.

The
bus
system
operates
eight
routes
from
Monday
to
Saturday
,
four
of
which
travel
to
nearby
cities
Central
Point
,
Jacksonville
,
Phoenix
,
Talent
,
Ashland
,
and
White
City
.

All
routes
connect
at
the
Front
Street
Transfer
Station
,
which
since
October
0000
has
contained
Medford
's
Greyhound
Bus
depot
.

Rail
There
are
no
passenger
trains
that
route
through
Medford
.

Amtrak
trains
serve
nearby
Klamath
Falls
.

People
in
Medford
can
board
the
Southwest
P.O.I.N.T.
(
an
intercity
bus
route
)
at
the
RVTD
Front
Street
Transfer
Station
that
will
deliver
them
to
the
train
station
in

.

Maritime
The
nearest
maritime
port
is
the
Port
of
Coos
Bay
,
which
is
away
.

The
nearby
Rogue
River
is
monitored
for
flood
ing
at
the
Gold
Ray
Dam
,
a
decommissioned
hydroelectric
dam
built
in
0000
near
Gold
Hill
.

The
National
Weather
Service
identifies
0.0
meters
(
00
ft
)
as
the
flood
level
.

At
this
depth
,
navigability
between
the
Pacific
Ocean
and
the
Rogue
Valley
is
limited
.

Even
a
small
"
handysize
"
freighter
is
unable
to
make
the
trip
,
and
any
ship
hauling
cargo
to
Medford
would
have
to
have
a
much
smaller
draw
.

Therefore
,
Medford
does
not
have
a
nearby
maritime
port
.

the
events
that
led
to
the
supposed
death
of
Dietrichson
,
Mr.
Jackson
proclaims
,
"
Mr.
Keyes
,
I
'm

History
Orace
Gabriel
Collver
moved
from
Coos
Bay
,
Oregon
to
Eastern
Oregon
and
founded
the
town
of
Culver
.

Since
he
was
the
postmaster
,
he
got
to
name
the
town
,
but
to
avoid
confusion
with
another
town
with
similar
spelling
and
sound
,
he
changed
it
to
Culver
.

He
built
a
general
store
,
which
housed
the
post
office
and
became
the
center
of
the
community
.

In
0000
,
the
railroad
came
through
,
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
,
so
the
town
relocated
to
the
railroad
.

Orace
had
the
whole
house
moved
to
the
new
location
,
while
the
townspeople
used
the
lumber
from
their
old
homes
and
buildings
to
build
new
ones
.

The
upstairs
of
his
store
housed
a
meeting
hall
that
was
used
for
local
events
and
dances
.

Orace
married
Margaret
J.
Barnett
on
October
00
,
0000
.

They
raised
Ruth
Church
,
the
daughter
of
his
sister
,
Sarah
Collver
Church
,
after
Sarah
's
death
.

Metolius
is
a
city
in
Jefferson
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
city
is
named
for
the
Metolius
River
,
a
nearby
tributary
of
the
Deschutes
River
.

The
name
for
both
comes
from
the
Warm
Springs
word
for
"
white
fish
"
,
referring
to
a
light
colored
salmon
and
not
a
whitefish
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

Geography
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

History
Metolius
was
founded
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
earliest
records
are
from
0000
and
written
in
German
.

In
February
0000
the
Oregon
Trunk
Railroad
decided
to
build
a
depot
,
turntable
and
roundhouse
in
the
town
.

The
railroad
was
connected
to
Bend
,
Oregon
.

Railroad
engines
at
the
time
needed
water
at
regular
intervals
,
and
Metolius
was
picked
as
a
servicing
spot
.

Electricity
was
provided
in
0000
from
a
small
dam
at
the
Cove
.

A
high
school
and
grade
school
were
built
in
0000
.

The
town
continued
to
prosper
during
the
war
years
and
by
0000
,
the
population
was
over
0,000
-
the
town
boasted
two
banks
,
two
newspapers
,
a
flour
mill
,
hotels
,
general
stores
,
hardware
stores
and
a
railroad
maintenance
hub
.

As
railroad
technology
improved
,
maintenance
stations
were
required
less
frequently
and
the
Metolius
shop
was
eliminated
.

Without
the
railroad
base
,
the
population
of
Metolius
went
into
decline
.

A
major
fire
in
the
0000s
destroyed
most
of
the
downtown
buildings
.

Drought
from
0000
to
0000
drove
many
farmers
broke
.

Then
the
great
depression
almost
finished
off
the
town
of
Metolius
.

By
0000
the
population
was
down
to
about
00
people
.

Prior
to
the
0000s
,
only
dry
farming
existed
in
the
area
.

An
irrigation
project
diverting
water
from
the
Deschutes
River
boosted
farming
output
and
the
town
began
to
grow
again
.

[

]
Through
an
extensive
canal
system
,
water
from
the
Deschutes
river
reaches
the
area
.

Farmers
were
now
able
to
grow
large
crops
-
mostly
mint
,
potatoes
and
hay
.

By
0000
over
0000
railroad
cars
of
fresh
potatoes
were
loaded
each
year
from
the
area
.

Four
giant
packing
sheds
stored
fresh
packed
potatoes
and
delivered
them
onto
railroad
cars
.

A
frozen
French
fry
factory
employed
many
workers
year
round
.

In
0000
a
potato
blight
of
nematodes
ended
large
scale
potato
production
in
this
area
.

In
0000
the
railroad
closed
its
depot
in
Metolius
.

By
0000
almost
all
mint
production
had
ended
due
to
root
rot
.

Now
in
0000
most
agricultural
production
around
Metolius
is
marginal
.

In
0000
Metolius
Elementary
began
to
grow
out
of
the
0000
high
school
building
with
a
new
gym
and
two
classrooms
.

Four
more
classrooms
are
built
in
0000
to
teach
the
children
in
the
town
which
was
growing
due
to
the
influx
of
agricultural
workers
and
workers
here
to
build
the
three
dams
which
now
block
the
Deschutes
River
.

About
0000
the
old
high
school
is
destroyed
(
students
now
go
to
Madras
)
and
the
elementary
was
again
expanded
to
include
an
office
,
a
library
and
two
more
classrooms
.

Its
last
expansion
occurred
in
0000
with
the
addition
of
six
new
classrooms
and
a
large
modern
library
.

The
first
Spanish
speaking
people
families
begin
to
settle
in
Metolius
in
the
0000s
drawn
by
field
work
hoeing
,
irrigating
and
harvesting
as
well
as
working
in
the
potato
sheds
.

Non-union
mills
converting
scrap
wood
from
lumber
operations
hired
many
more
Spanish
speaking
workers
from
Mexico
.

Now
over
00
%
of
the
students
at
Metolius
Elementary
speak
Spanish
at
home
.

Around
0000
,
a
fire
in
the
city
's
Post
Office
led
to
the
end
of
the
ZIP
Code
for
the
community
,
and
it
afterward
shared
the
ZIP
Code
of
nearby
Madras
.

However
,
in
late
0000
,
city
leaders
enlisted
the
help
of
U.S.
Representative
Greg
Walden
to
reclaim
the
code
.
"

We
're
just
trying
to
get
the
town
to
have
its
own
personality
again
,
"
said
Metolius
mayor
Darrell
Agee
.
"

Right
now
,
it
's
solely
a
bedroom
community
for
Madras
.

The
ZIP
Code
is
just
one
step
toward
the
future
.
"

Despite
several
attempts
to
start
businesses
,
Metolius
serves
mainly
as
a
bedroom
community
to
Madras
and
other
larger
towns
up
to
00
miles
away
.

But
a
keen
eye
can
see
in
the
various
houses
built
at
different
times
the
pulse
of
migration
into
Metolius
,
Oregon
.

Now
a
prison
is
being
built
in
Madras
and
new
homes
are
being
built
for
its
workers
.

Cave
Junction
,
incorporated

,

As

population
was

.

Its
motto
is
the
"
Gateway
to
the
Oregon
Caves
,
"
and
the
city
got
its
name
by
virtue
of
its
location
at
the
junction
of
Redwood
Highway
(
U.S.
Route

)
and
Caves

Cave
Junction
is
located
in
the
Illinois
Valley
,
where
,
starting
in
the
0000s
,
the
non-native
economy
depended
on
gold
mining
.

After
World
War
II
,
timber
became
the
main
source
of
income
for
residents
.

As
timber
income
has
since
declined
,
Cave
Junction
is
attempting
to
compensate
with
tourism
and
as
a
haven
for
retirees
.

Tourists

Caves
National

History
For
thousands
of
years
,
the
Takelma
Indians
inhabited
the
Illinois
Valley
.

Their
culture
was
destroyed
when
gold
was
discovered
in
the
early
0000s
,
causing
the
subsequent
Rogue
River
Wars
.

After
an
0000
treaty
,
most
of
the
Takelmas
lived
on
the
Table
Rock
Reservation
.

In
0000
,
after
the
wars
ended
,
they
were
moved
to
the
Grand
Ronde
Reservation
and
the
Siletz
Reservation
.

The
first
gold
in
Oregon
history
was
found
in
the
Illinois
Valley
,
as
well
as
the
largest
gold
nugget
(
)
.

In
0000
,
more
than
00
years
after
prospectors
had
started
combing
the
valley
for
gold
,
an
00-year-old
named
Ray
Briggs
discovered
what
newspapers
at
the
time
called
"
the
most
wonderful
gold
discovery
ever
reported
in
Oregon
history
.
"

While
hunting
along
Sucker
Creek
,
he
discovered
gold
lying
on
the
ground
.

He
staked
a
claim
and
called
it
the
"
Wounded
Buck
Mine
,
"
which
produced
of
gold
.

The
"
mine
"
was
a
small
vein
of
gold
wide
,
long
and
deep
.

As
gold
mining
in
the
Illinois
Valley
became
exhausted
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
the
residents
diversified
into
ranching
,
fishing
,
logging
,
tourism
and
agriculture
.

In
0000
,
Elijah
Davidson
found
a
cave
while
on
a
hunting
trip
,
and
is
now
credited
with
discovering
the
Oregon
Caves
.

In
0000
,
Walter
C.
Burch
heard
about
the
cave
from
Davidson
,
and
staked
a
squatter
's
claim
at
the
mouth
of
the
caves
.

He
and
his
brothers-in-law
charged
one
dollar
for
a
guided
tour
.

According
to
their
advertisement
in
the
Grants
Pass
Courier
,
this
included
camping
,
plentiful
pasture
land
and
"
medicinal
"
cave
waters
.

They
attempted
to
acquire
title
to
the
land
,
but
as
the
land
was
unsurveyed
,
they
abandoned
the
idea
a
few
years
later
.

President
William
Howard
Taft
established
the
Oregon
Caves
National
Monument
on
July
00
,
0000
,
to
be
administered
by
the
U.S.
Forest
Service
.

In
0000
,
the
Forest
Service
subcontracted
the
building
of
a
hotel
and
guide
services
to
a
group
of
Grants
Pass
businessmen
.

By
0000
,
the
monument
had
a
chalet
and
seven
two-bedroom
cabins
.

Traffic
into
the
caves
led
to
a
community
developing
at
the
junction
of
the
Redwood
Highway
and
the
branch
highway
to
the
caves
(
now
known
as
Oregon
Route
00
)
.

Cave
Junction
,
originally
known
as
Cave
City
,
was
established
in
0000
on
land
donated
by
Elwood
Hussey
.

In
0000
,
a
post
office
was
applied
for
and
was
named
"
Caves
City
"
,
however
postal
authorities
disapproved
of
the
name
,
partly
because
"
City
"
implied
the
place
was
incorporated
.

Among
the
other
names
suggested
was
"
Cave
Junction
"
,
which
was
adopted
by
the
United
States
Board
on
Geographic
Names
in
0000
with
the
post
office
being
renamed
the
same
year
.

The
locality
was
incorporated
as
Cave
Junction
in
0000
,
and
is
the
only
incorporated
area
in
the
Illinois
Valley
.

In

Cave
Junction

Its
growth
was
fast
in

,
increasing
at
an
average
of

.

The

population
's
primary
growth
period
occurred
in

0000s
,
with

.

Growth
slowed
in
the
0000s
when
the
population
increase
averaged
only
0.0
percent
annually
.

The
rate
fell
further
between
0000
and
0000
,
averaging
0.0

,
which
was
less
than
the
state
and
county
averages
.

Forest

Longwood
Fire
,
part

complex
,
was
ignited
by
lightning
strikes
following
a
three

.

Numerous
residents
of
Cave
Junction
responded
by
evacuating
.

In

,
the
Florence

communities
.

Ultimately
,
the
Biscuit
Fire
lasted
000
days

Economy
Starting
in
the
early
0000s
,
gold
mining
was
the
main
source
of
income
in
the
Illinois
Valley
.

As
gold
mining
dwindled
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
the
economy
diversified
into
ranching
,
fishing
,
logging
,
tourism
and
agriculture
.

In
the
years
after
World
War
II
,
timber
became
an
increasingly
large
part
of
the
county
's
finances
.

There
were
00
lumber
mills
operating
in
the
valley
after
the
war
,
but
by
the
late
0000s
the
number
had
dwindled
to
just
one
.

Because
of
President
Roosevelt
's
creation
of
the
Siskiyou
National
Forest
,
and
the
reversion
of
Oregon
and
California
Railroad
lands
to
federal
government
control
,
by
0000
the
U.S.
Forest
Service
and
the
Bureau
of
Land
Management
were
in
charge
of
00
%
of
the
land
in
Josephine
county
,
and
a
large
part
of
the
Illinois
Valley
.

Because
this
decreased
the
county
's
potential
tax
base
,
the
government
shared
money
earned
from
timber
sales
with
the
county
,
and
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
from
the
federal
government
became
a
large
part
of
its
tax
base
.

In
0000
,
Josephine
County
received
$
00,000,000
in
various
federal
payments
;
by
0000
,
the
payments
had
fallen
to
$
0.0
million
.

Because
of
these
budget
cutbacks
,
Southern
Oregon
has
used
tourism
as
a
means
of
attracting
small
businesses
and
retirees
.

The
movement
of
California
retirees
in
particular
has
helped
the
economy
grow
.

Although
jobs
have
been
created
as
a
result
,
they
are
usually
low-paying
.

Today
the
principal
industries
are
tourism
,
timber
and
agriculture
.

Since
about
0000
,
the
community
has
evolved
into
a
center
for
wine
,
retirement
,
tourism
,
and
small
businesses
.

One
timber
mill
remains
in
Cave
Junction
,
Rough
&
Ready
Lumber
Co.
,
located
six
miles
(
00
km
)
south
of
town
.

In
November
0000
,
Rough
&
Ready
completed
a
$
0
million
biomass
plant
to
replace
their
existing
wood-fired
boiler
,
as
market
forces
have
increased
demand
for
dry
timber
.

The
Illinois
Valley
Community
Development
Organization
(
IVCDO
)
,
formed
in
0000
,
has
attracted
notice
for
its
work
directed
at
improving
the
Illinois
Valley
economy
.

In
0000
,
Cave
Junction
was
awarded
the
Great
Strides
Award
by
the
Northwest
Area
Foundation
for
the
IVCDO
's
efforts
to
reduce
long-term
poverty
.

In
0000
,
the
IVCDO
began
a
partnership
with
the
National
Park
Service
that
resulted
in
the
assumption
of
00
seasonal
and
year-around
jobs
managing
the
Oregon
Caves
Chateau
.

The
project
uses
local
produce
,
food
products
and
wine
at
the
Chateau
,
and
the
proceeds
are
directed
back
into
the
local
community
.

Wine
The
Illinois
Valley
is
the
coolest
and
wettest
of
the
three
valleys
in
the
Rogue
Valley
American
Viticultural
Area
.

In
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
a
new
group
of
Oregonians
started
experimenting
with
growing
grapes
and
making
wine
.

Initially
this
group
was
not
very
successful
,
but
00
years
later
,
Oregon
is
considered
a
prestigious
growing
area
.

Southern
Oregon
is
higher
,
and
its
climate
is
often
warmer
,
than
better
known
wine
producing
valleys
such
as
Napa
Valley
to
the
south
and
Willamette
Valley
and
Columbia
Valley
to
the
north
.

The
Illinois
Valley
has
dry
warm
summers
and
cold
nights
,
which
make
it
well
suited
for
pinot
noir
,
in
contrast
to
the
hotter
and
dryer
Rogue
and
Umpqua
valleys
.

Several
vineyards
and
wineries
are

Historic
sites
Cave
Junction
has
a
number
of
historic
sites
related
to
its
early
gold
mining
days
,
including
various
mines
,
ditches
,
and
Logan
Cut
.

The
historic
Osgood
Ditch
in
Takilma
provided
water
for
early
mining
operations
in
the
Illinois
Valley
.

Although
mining
in
the
Illinois
Valley
started
in
the
rivers
,
gold
was
soon
discovered
in
gravel
beds
high
up
the
slopes
above
the
rivers
.

It
had
been
deposited
by
ancient
rivers
that
then
eroded
deep
into
the
earth
.

To
extract
this
gold
,
prospectors
created
ditches
to
bring
the
water
to
these
areas
.

The
water
was
then
moved
through
piping
to
the
desired
location
.

The
pressure
the
water
built
up
as
it
dropped
was
used
for
hydraulic
mining
.

Water
cannons
fired
water
over
,
and
the
debris
was
run
through
a
sluice
box
.

Gold
was
located
within
pockets
in
the
gravel
,
and
because
the
miners
could
not
predict
where
the
pockets
were
,
almost
every
gravel
deposit
in
the
Illinois
Valley
was
mined
.

The
Illinois
Valley
's
largest
gold
rush
town
,
Waldo
,
Oregon
,
was
located
on
a
gravel
deposit
and
was
eventually
destroyed
when
its
gravel
bed
was
run
through
a
sluice
box
,
along
with
most
of
the
town
.

Today
nothing
of
Waldo
remains
.

The
Osgood
Ditch
provided
water
for
mining
operations
near
Waldo
.

One
building
of
note
in
the
area
is
the
Oregon
Caves
Chateau
,
which
is
a
National
Historic
Landmark
.

One
of
the
well
known
mining
communities
AltHouse
established
the
AltHouse
Church
in
0000
about
a
0/0
mile
down
on
Dick
George
Road
.

This
church
is
one
of
the
oldest
building
in
the
valley
still
standing
and
still
in
use
.

Between
0000-0
the
Church
was
moved
down
to
its
present
site
on
Holland
Loop
Road
where
it
has
served
the
community
till
this
day
.

It
is
currently
known
as
Bridgeview
Community
Church
(
since
the
0000s
)
.

A
newer
building
was
built
in
0000
where
services
are
now
being
held
every
Sunday
.

The
original
church
is
currently
under
restoration
and
will
continue
to
be
as
the
builders
back
then
said
;
"
A
place
for
us
or

to
worship

Grants
Pass
is
a
city
in
,
and
the
county
seat
of
Josephine
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
city
is
located
on
Interstate
0
,
northwest
of
Medford
.

Attractions
include
the
Rogue
River
,
famous
for
its
rafting
,
and
the
nearby
Oregon
Caves
National
Monument
located
south
of
the
city
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
United
States
Census
.

History
Early
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
hunters
and
trappers
,
following
the
Siskiyou
Trail
,
passed
through
the
site
beginning
in
the
0000s
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
settlers
(
mostly
American
)
following
the
Applegate
Trail
began
traveling
through
the
area
on
their
way
to
the
Willamette
Valley
.

The
city
states
that
the
name
was
selected
to
honor
General
Ulysses
S.
Grant
's
success
at
Vicksburg
.

Grants
Pass
post
office
was
established
on
March
00
,
0000
.

The
city
of
Grants
Pass
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
a
year
after
it
had
become
the
county
seat
.

The
Oregon-Utah
Sugar
Company
,
financed
by
Charles
W.
Nibley
was
created
,
leading
to
a
sugar
beet
factory
being
built
in
Grants
Pass
in
0000
.

Before
the
factory
opened
,
Oregon-Utah
Sugar
was
merged
into
the
Utah-Idaho
Sugar
Company
.

Due
to
labor
shortages
and
low
acreage
planted
in
sugar
beets
,
the
processing
machinery
was
moved
to
Toppenish
,
Washington
in
0000
or
0000
.

In
0000
,
a
group
of
local
businessmen
incorporated
the
Grants
Pass
Cavemen
.

Taking
their
name
from
the
nearby
Oregon
Caves
National
Monument
,
this
group
was
one
of
many
groups
of
boosterism
common
in
the
United
States
at
the
time
.

For
decades
afterwards
,
this
group
would
represent
their
city
in
countless
public
gatherings
,
dressed
in
furs
and
bearing
clubs
,
performing
such
uncivilized
acts
as
capturing
female
crowd
members
and
politicians
and
putting
them
in
their
cages
.

To
honor
this
group
,
in
0000
a
fiberglass
statue
of
a
caveman
was
erected
at
the
corner
of
Morgan
Lane
and
Sixth
Street
.

Grants
Pass
High
School
's
mascot
is
also
the
caveman
.

The
original
monument
was
damaged
by
arson
in

and
repaired
in
0000
.

south
wind
blew
hard
.

Their
name
for
the
falls
was
Tiwishkeni
,
or
"
where
the
falling
waters
rush
"
.

The
Modoc
Tribe
's
homeland
is
about
south
of
Klamath
Falls
,
but
when
they
were
pushed
onto
a
reservation
with
their
adversaries
the
Klamath
,
a
rebellion
ensued
and
they
hid
out
in
nearby
lava
beds
.

This
led
to
the
Modoc
War
of
0000
–
0000
,
which
was
a
hugely
expensive
campaign
for
the
US
Cavalry
,
costing
an
estimated
$
000,000
–
the
equivalent
of
over
0
million
in
year-0000
dollars
.

Seventeen
Indians
and
00
whites
were
killed
.

The
Applegate
Trail
,
which
passes
through
the
lower
Klamath
area
,
was
blazed
in
0000
from
west
to
east
in
an
attempt
to
provide
a
safer
route
for
emigrants
on
the
Oregon
Trail
.

The
Klamath
Reclamation
Project
began
in
0000
to
drain
marshland
and
move
water
to
allow
for
agriculture
.

With
the
building
of
the
main
"
A
"
Canal
,
water
was
first
made
available
May
00
,
0000
.

Veterans
of
World
War
I
and
World
War
II
were
given
homesteading
opportunities
on
the
reclaimed
land
.

During
World
War
II
,
a
Japanese-American
internment
camp
,
the
Tule
Lake
War
Relocation
Center
,
was
located
in
nearby
Newell
,
California
,
and
a
satellite
of
the
Camp
White
,
Oregon
,
POW
camp
was
located
just
on
the
Oregon-California
border
near
the
town
of
Tulelake
,
California
.

In
May
0000
,
about
east
of
Klamath
Falls
,
(
near
Bly
,
Oregon
)
a
Japanese
balloon
bomb
killed
a
woman
and
five
children
on
a
church
outing
.

This
is
said
to
be
the
only
Japanese-inflicted
casualty
on
the
US
mainland
during
the
war
.

Timber
harvesting
through
the
use
of
railroad
was
extensive
in
Klamath
County
for
the
first
few
decades
of
the
00th
century
.

With
the
arrival
of
the
Southern
Pacific
Transportation
Company
in
0000
,
Klamath
Falls
grew
quickly
from
a
few
hundred
to
several
thousand
.

Dozens
of
lumber
mills
cut
fir
and
pine
lumber
,
and
the
industry
flourished
until
the
late
0000s
when
the
Northern
Spotted
Owl
and
other
endangered
species
were
driving
forces
in
changing
western
forest
policy
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
an
earthquake
struck
near
Klamath
Falls
.

Many
downtown
buildings
,
including
the
county
courthouse
and
the
former
Sacred
Heart
Academy
and
Convent
,
were
damaged
or
destroyed
.

There
were
two
deaths
attributed
to
the
earthquake
.

Water
rights
controversy
The
city
made
national
headlines
in
0000
when
a
court
decision
was
made
to
shut
off
Klamath
Project
irrigation
water
on
April
0
because
of
Endangered
Species
Act
requirements
.

The
Lost
River
sucker
and
shortnose
sucker
were
listed
on
the
Federal
Endangered
Species
List
in
0000
,
and
when
drought
struck
in
0000
,
a
panel
of
scientists
stated
that
further
diversion
of
water
for
agriculture
would
be
detrimental
to
these
species
,
which
reside
in
the
Upper
Klamath
Lake
,
as
well
as
to
the
protected
Coho
salmon
which
spawn
in
the
Klamath
River
.

Many
protests
by
farmers
and
citizens
culminated
in
a
"
Bucket
Brigade
"
on
Main
Street
May
0
,
0000
in
Klamath
Falls
.

The
event
was
attended
by
00,000
farmers
,
ranchers
,
citizens
,
and
politicians
.

Two
giant
bucket
monuments
have
since
been
constructed
and
erected
in
town
to
commemorate
the
event
.

Such
universal
criticism
resulted
in
a
new
plan
implemented
in
early
0000
to
resume
irrigation
to
farmers
.

Low
river
flows
in
the
Klamath
and
Trinity
rivers
and
high
temperatures
led
to
a
mass
die-off
of
at
least
00,000
salmon
in
0000
.

Dwindling
salmon
numbers
have
practically
shut
down
the
fishing
industry
in
the
region
and
caused
over
$
00
million
in
disaster
aid
being
given
to
fishermen
to
offset
losses
.

Ninety
percent
of
Trinity
River
water
is
diverted
for
California
Agriculture
.

According
to
a
National
Academy
of
Sciences
report
of
October
00
,
0000
,
limiting
irrigation
water
did
little
if
anything
to
help
endangered
fish
and
may
have
hurt
the
populations
.

A
contrary
report
has
criticized
the
National
Academy
of
Sciences
report
.

The
Chiloquin
Dam
has
been
removed
to
help
improve
sucker
spawning
habitat
.

Geothermal
heating
Klamath

geothermal
resource
area

Geothermal
power
has
been
used
directly
for
geothermal
heating
in
the
area
since
the
early
the
0000s
.

A
downtown
district
heating
system
was
constructed
in
0000
and
extended
in
0000
.

There
was
public
opposition
to
the
scheme
.

Many
homes
were
heated
by
private
geothermal
wells
and
owners
were
concerned
that
the
city
system
could
lower
the
water
level
and/or
reduce
water
temperatures
.

System
operation
was
delayed
until
0000
following
an
aquifer
study
.

Full
operational
testing
showed
no
negative
impact
on
the
private
wells
.

The
system
was
shut
down
again
in
0000
after
multiple
distribution
piping
failures
were
discovered
.

By
0000
,
the
distribution
piping
had
been
reconstructed
and
the
system
was
back
in
operation

The
system
has
been
expanded
since
then
and
according
to
the
Oregon
Institute
of
Technology
the
operation
is
"
at

a
fire
swept
through
Lakeview
destroying
00
businesses
.

The
town
was
rebuilt
in
0000
using
brick
and
corrugated
iron
roofs
.

In
0000
a
second
fire
threatened
the
community
,
but
was
contained
to
a
few
buildings
and
homes

fire
in

The
geyser
has
not
erupted
since

,
possibly

the
Warner
Creek
Correctional
Facility
with

not

,
from
whence
the
horse

Cottage
Grove
is
a
city
in
Lane
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Cottage
Grove
is
the
third
largest
city
in
Lane
County
.

The
city
is
located
on
Interstate
0
,
Oregon
Route
00
,
and
the
main
Willamette
Valley
line
of
the
Union
Pacific
railroad
.

History
Cottage
Grove
post
office
was
established
in
0000
east
of
present-day
Creswell
.

The
office
was
named
by
its
first
postmaster
,
G.
C.
Pearce
,
whose
home
was
in
an
oak
grove
.

In
0000
,
the
office
was
moved
to
the
present
site
of
Saginaw
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
the
office
was
moved
to
what
is
now
the
extreme
southwestern
part
of
present-day
Cottage
Grove
,
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Coast
Fork
Willamette
River
.

When
the
Southern
Pacific
railroad
was
built
through
the
area
in
the
0000s
,
Cottage
Grove
station
was
placed
more
than
half
a
mile
northeast
of
the
post
office
,
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
.

This
was
the
start
of
a
neighborhood
dispute
that
lasted
for
nearly
00
years
.

The
people
living
near
the
post
office
did
not
want
it
moved
to
the
railroad
station
,
so
a
new
office
was
established
at
the
station
with
the
name
Lemati
,
which
is
a
Chinook
Jargon
word
that
means
"
mountain
"
.

Lemati
office
ran
from
November
0000
to
September
0000
,
but
in
March
0000
the
Cottage
Grove
office
was
renamed
Lemati
and
it
ran
that
way
until
being
permanently
renamed
Cottage
Grove
in
May
0000
.

The
city
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
but
the
people
living
on
the
east
side
rebelled
in
0000
and
founded
East
Cottage
Grove
.

The
Oregon
State
Legislature
changed
the
name
of
the
place
to
Lemati
in
0000
,
and
the
signboard
for
the
station
listed
Cottage
Grove
,
as
well
as
Lemati
in
smaller
letters
.

In
0000
an
act
was
passed
that
consolidated
the
two
towns
under
the
name
Cottage
Grove
.

In
0000
,
Buster
Keaton
's
The
General

filmed
in
Cottage
Grove
and
the
surrounding
countryside
.

The
movie
included
a
spectacular
locomotive
crash
,
and
the
wrecked
train
became
a
minor
tourist
attraction
until
it
was
dismantled
for
scrap
during
World
War
II
.

History
The
Florence
area
was
originally
inhabited
by
the
Siuslaw
tribe
of
Native
Americans
.

Some
state
that
the
city
was
named
for
state
senator
A.
B.
Florence
,
who
represented
Lane
County
from
0000
–
0000
;
another
notion
is
that
Florence
was
named
for
a
French
vessel
that
was
wrecked
at
the
mouth
of
the
Siuslaw
River
on
February
00
,
0000
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
a
dead
sperm
whale
that
had
washed
up
on
the
beach
was
destroyed
with
dynamite
,
the
theory
being
that
scavengers
such
as
seagulls
and
crabs
would
consume
the
smaller
pieces
.

Decades
later
,
the
resulting
debacle
became
widely
known
via
the
Internet
as
the
exploding
whale
story
.

Geography
The
municipality
is
covered
with
forests
and
lakes
.

It
labels
itself
"
The
southernmost
wildlife
in
Sweden
"
,
probably
because
there
are
scarsely
any
forests
or
lakes
south
of
the
Blekinge
province
.

The

The

Oakridge
is
a
city
in
Lane
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
as
of
the
0000
census
.

It
is
located
east
of
Westfir
on
Oregon
Route
00
,
about
east
of
Eugene
and
southeast
of
Portland
.

Surrounded
by
the
Willamette
National
Forest
and
the
Cascade
Range
,
Oakridge
is
popular
with
outdoor
enthusiasts
for
its
hiking
,
mountain
biking
,
wildflower
s
,
fly
fishing
,
birding
,
watersports
,
and
nearby
Willamette
Pass
Resort
.

The
city
was
originally
a
community
called
"
Hazeldell
"
,
and
its
post
office
was
established
on
July
00
,
0000
.

When
a
station
on
the
Southern
Pacific
Railroad
opened
in
May
0000
,
it
was
named
"
Oak
Ridge
"
by
a
railroad
executive
for
the
surrounding
topography
,
and
on
July
00
of
that
year
,
the
name
was
changed
to
"
Oakridge
"
.

The
economy
of
Oakridge
and
nearby
Westfir
has
been
centered
around
the
railroad
,
the
logging
industry
,
and
recreation
.

In
the
00th
century
,
there
were
two
sawmills
that
processed
logs
from
nearby
timberland
—
an
Oakridge
mill
owned
by
the
Pope
and
Talbot
Lumber
Company
and
an
Edward
Hines
mill
in
Westfir
.

Both
of
the
mills
had
closed
by
0000
,
and
the
local
economy
declined
.

Since
then
it
has
been
slightly
rebounding
,
with
a
new
general
store
opening
in
0000
,
a
bakery
in
0000
,
and
a
brewery
and
mercantile
.

History
The
area
now
known
as
Oakridge
was
first
explored
in
0000
as
a
possible
route
for
pioneers
coming
from
Central
Oregon
to
the
Willamette
Valley
.

A
post
office
was
named
"
Hazeldell
"
in
0000
,
and
the
place
's
name
later
changed
to
"
Big
Prairie
"
,
and
then
"
Oak
Ridge
"
.

In
0000
,
a
new
community
was
formed
and
officially
named
Oakridge
.

Since
its
beginnings
as
a
mountain
ranch
,
Oakridge
has
been
a
railroad
boomtown
,
a
lumberjack
s
'
haven
,
and
an
outdoor
enthusiast
's
destination
.

The
early
boom
for
Oakridge
can
be
attributed
to
the
Southern
Pacific
Railroad
.

By
0000
,
work
had
already
begun
on
Tunnel
00
,
a
short
route
connecting
Oakridge
to
the
area
now
known
as
Westfir
.

Oakridge
was
a
station
on
Southern
Pacific
's
Cascade
subdivision
,
a
line
that
goes
over
Willamette
Pass
via
the
Natron
Cutoff
that
was
built
in
0000
,
and
the
railroad
played
an
integral
part
of
the
economy
and
lifestyle
in
Oakridge
.

The
Union
Pacific
Railroad
still
operates
the
rails
and
trains
are
a
common
sight
in
Oakridge
.

On
July
0
,
0000
,
the
Pope
and
Talbot
Lumber
Company
purchased
timber
land
near
Oakridge
.

By
0000
,
the
company
had
built
a
large
sawmill
and
had
begun
a
massive
timber
logging
operation
.

While
the
railroad
and
Westfir
's
Hines
sawmill
began
to
slow
down
,
the
Pope
and
Talbot
mill
expanded
and
eventually
employed
more
than
000
people
.

The
combined
economic
base
of
the
railroad
and
sawmills
accounted
for
the
population
growth
of
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
when
the
community
of
Willamette
City
was
consolidated
into
Oakridge
.

However
,
in
0000
,
the
Hines
mill
in
Westfir
closed
,
and
by
0000
the
Pope
and
Talbot
Mill
had
laid
off
all
of
its
workers
.

The
City
of
Oakridge
now
owns
the
property
that
formerly
housed
the
Pope
and
Talbot
sawmill
.

History
The
name
Westfir
was
first
used
for
the
community
in
July
0000
.

The
name
came
from
the
Western
Lumber
Company
,
which
produced
Douglas-fir
lumber
and
had
established
Westfir
as
a
company
town
.

A
major
customer
of
the
mill
at
this
time
was
the
Southern
Pacific
Railroad
,
which
was
building
its
line
over
Willamette
Pass
between
Eugene
and
Klamath
Falls
in
the
0000s
and
passing
through
Westfir
.

Westfir
post
office

established
in
November
0000
.

The
population
in
0000
was
000

The
Western
Lumber
sawmill
was
later
sold
to
the
Westfir
Lumber
Company
and
in
0000
to
the
Edward
Hines
Lumber
Company
.

Hines
established
a
plywood
mill
in
Westfir
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Hines
closed
the
mills
and
sold
the
entire
town
,
including
the
water
and
sewer
system
.

The
town
's
new
owners
wanted
the
utilities
to
be
in
public
ownership
,
so
local
residents
voted
to
incorporate
in
0000
.

The
mill
operations
closed
in
0000
,
after
a
series
of
fires
.

Oregon
's
longest
existing
covered
bridge
,
the

Bridge
,
was
built
across
the

Middle
Fork
Willamette
River
in
0000
to
connect
the
Westfir
Lumber
Company
mill
to
the
main
office
.

called
"
Graham
's
Landing
"
until
a

two
years
later
.

Joseph
D.
Graham
,
John

Yachats
(
)
is
a
small
coastal
city
in
Lincoln
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

According
to
Oregon
Geographic
Names
,
the
name
comes
from
the
Siletz
language
,
and
means
"
dark
water
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
"
.

There
is
a
range
of
differing
etymologies
,
however
.

William
Bright
says
the
name
comes
from
the
Alsea
placename
/
yáx̣ayky
/
.

At
the
0000
census
,
the
city
's
population
was
000
.

In
0000
,
Budget
Travel
magazine
named
Yachats
one
of
the
"
Ten
Coolest
Small
Towns
of
the
U.S.A.
"
,
and
Yachats
was
chosen
among
the
top
00
U.S.
up-and-coming
vacation
destinations
by
Virtualtourist
.

In
0000
,
Arthur
Frommer
,
founder
of
Frommer
's
Travel
Guides
,
listed
Yachats
number
seven
among
his
ten
favorite
vacation
destinations
in
the
world
.

History
Archeological
studies
have
shown
that
the
Yachats
area
has
been
inhabited
for
at
least
0,000
years
.

Remains
of
a
pit
house
in
Yachats
have
been
radiocarbon
dated
at
approximately
000
AD
.

Yachats
is
built
on
seashell
midden
s
and
numerous
graves
left
by
its
past
inhabitants
.

Excavations
for
construction
of
buildings
and
U.S.
Highway
000
uncovered
a
great
many
skeletons
and
artifacts
.

Most
of
these
became
part
of
the
fill
dirt
forming
the
base
of
the
current
highway
and
city
.

For
many
centuries
the
Native
Americans
in
this
area
were
hunter-gather
ers
who
migrated
between
summer
camps
and
winter
residences
.

The
Alsea
Tribe
had
as
many
as
00
permanent
villages
(
used
on
an
annually
rotating
basis
)
on
the
Alsea
River
and
the
central
Oregon
coast
.

Archeological
and
linguistic
evidence
support
the
existence
of
a
southern
Alsea
village
known
as
the
Yahuch
band
,
located
on
the
coast
at
the
Yachats
River
.

By
0000
,
the
Yahuch
band
was
extinct
,
many
having
succumbed
to
European
diseases
such
as
smallpox
and
tuberculosis
.

In
order
to
open
up
land
in
the
Coos
Bay
area
for
homesteading
in
the
early
0000s
,
the
U.S.
Army
forcibly
marched
the
Coos
and
Lower
Umpqua
Indians
north
over
rugged
terrain
to
the
Alsea
Sub-Agency
reservation
in
Yachats
where
the
peaceful
Indians
,
treated
by
the
Army
as
though
they
were
prisoners
of
war
,
were
incarcerated
.

Amanda
's
Trail
,
named
for
a
blind
Indian
woman
who
suffered
greatly
on
the
march
,
was
dedicated
on
July
00
,
0000
.

The
trail
climbs
from
downtown
Yachats
to
the
summit
of
Cape
Perpetua
where
it
links
with
the
extensive
trail
system
of
the
Siuslaw
National
Forest
.

In
Yachats
the
hunter-gatherer
tribes
were
forced
to
learn
to
make
a
living
by
agriculture
.

Crops
planted
near
the
ocean
failed
,
resulting
in
many
deaths
from
starvation
.

Approximately
000
Indians
died
in
just
00
years
.

Twelve
years
after
the
Alsea
Sub-Agency
had
opened
,
the
Indians
were
allowed
to
establish
a
trail
and
develop
agricultural
plots
up
the
Yachats
River
Valley
,
where
they
were
able
to
grow
potatoes
,
oats
,
wheat
,
and
corn
.

They
were
also
allowed
to
return
to
hunting
.

Once
the
Indians
had
built
a
new
life
there
,
the
U.S.
government
opened
up
the
area
for
homesteading
in
0000
,
and
once
again
,
forced
the
Indians
to
move
—
some
returned
to
their
ancestral
homelands
,
others
went
north
to
the
Siletz
Reservation
.

Many
of
the
Indians
died
during
this
relocation
.

Homesteaders
used
the
Indian
farms
and
trails
to
develop
the
Yachats
area
.

In
0000
the
first
post
office
was
established
in
Yachats
(
called
Oceanview
until
it
was
renamed
Yachats
in
0000
)
.

Until
Yachats
could
be
reached
by
a
macadam
road
,
rains
made
it
impossible
for
the
mail
to
be
carried
by
car
.

The
Roosevelt
Memorial
Highway
(
now
Highway
000
)
,
carved
out
of
the
rock
of
Cape
Perpetua
in
0000
,
changed
all
this
by
opening
up
a
route
from
the
town
of
Florence
.

Despite
the
early
difficulties
of
reaching
Yachats
,
the
tourist
industry
began
in
0000
with
the
conversion
of
a
chittum
bark
warehouse
into
the
first
hotel
.

Today
tourism
is
the
city
's
main
industry
.

Yachats
was
part
of
the
war
effort
in
both
World
Wars
I
and
II
.

Spruce
was
needed
for
airplanes
during
World
War
I
,
and
in
0000
the
U.S.
Army
Signal
Corps
undertook
logging
at
Camp
0
,
an
area
about
north
of
Yachats
.

A
railroad
needed
for
transporting
logs
to
a
mill
was
completed
just
three
days
before
the
war
ended
.

A
private
company
continued
the
logging
operations
,
however
.

Early
in
World
War
II
the
West
Shelter
built
by
the
Civilian
Conservation
Corps
(
CCC
)
near
the
top
of
Cape
Perpetua
was
used
as
an
observation
site
and
radar
station
for
the
detection
of
enemy
submarines
and
aircraft
.
