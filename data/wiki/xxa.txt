area
.

Hattiesburg
is
positioned
at
the
fork
of
the
Leaf
and
Bouie
Rivers
,
and
was
founded
in
0000
by
Captain
William
H.
Hardy
,
a
civil
engineer
.

Early
settlers
to
the
area
were
of
Scottish
,
Scots-Irish
,
and
English
descent
who
came
from
Georgia
and
the
Carolinas
,
attracted
by
the
vast
area
of
virgin
pine
timberlands
.

The
city
of
Hattiesburg
was
incorporated
in
0000
with
a
population
of
approximately
000
.

Originally
called
Twin
Forks
and
later
Gordonville
,
Hardy
gave
the
city
its
final
name
of
Hattiesburg
,
in
honor
of
his
wife
Hattie
.

Also
in
0000
,
a
railroad
—
known
then
as
the
New
Orleans
and
Northeastern
—
was
built
from
Meridian
,
Mississippi
,
through
Hattiesburg
to
New
Orleans
.

The
completion
of
the
Gulf
and
Ship
Island
Railroad
(
G&SIRR
)
from
Gulfport
,
Mississippi
,
to
Jackson
,
Mississippi
,
ran
through
Hattiesburg
and
ushered
in
the
real
lumber
boom
in
0000
.

Though
it
was
00
years
in
the
building
,
the
G&SIRR
more
than
fulfilled
its
promise
.

It
gave
the
state
a
deep
water
harbor
,
more
than
doubled
the
population
of
towns
along
its
route
,
built
the
City
of
Gulfport
and
made
Hattiesburg
a
railroad
center
.

In
0000
,
the
G&SIRR
operated
as
a
subsidiary
of
the
Illinois
Central
Railroad
but
lost
its
independent
identity
in
0000
.

Hattiesburg
gained
its
nickname
,
the
Hub
City
,
in
0000
as
a
result
of
a
contest
in
a
local
newspaper
.

This
suggestion
came
because
the
city
was
the
intersection
of
a
number
of
important
rail
lines
.

Later
the
city
also
became
the
intersection
of
state
highways
U.S.
Highway
00
,
U.S.
Highway
00
and
U.S.
Highway
00
,
and
later
,
Interstate
00
.

Hattiesburg
is
centrally
located
less
than
000
miles
from
the
state
capital
of
Jackson
as
well
as
the
Mississippi
Gulf
Coast
,
New
Orleans
and
Mobile
,
Alabama
.

The
region
around
Hattiesburg
was
involved
in
the
nuclear
arms
race
of
the
Cold
War
.

In
the
0000s
,
two
nuclear
devices
were
detonated
in
the
salt
domes
near
Lumberton
,
Mississippi
,
about
00
miles
southwest
of
Hattiesburg
.

Extensive
follow-up
of
the
area
by
the
EPA
has
not
revealed
levels
of
nuclear
contamination
in
the
area
that
would
be
harmful
to
humans
.

Throughout
the
00th
Century
,
Hattiesburg
benefited
from
the
founding
of
Camp
Shelby
(
now
a
military
mobilization
center
)
,
two
major
hospitals
,
and
two
colleges
,
The
University
of
Southern
Mississippi
and
William
Carey
University
.

The
growing
metropolitan
area
that
includes
Hattiesburg
,
Forrest
and
Lamar
Counties
,
was
designated
a
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
in
0000
with
a
combined
population
of
more
than
000,000
residents
.

Despite
being
about
inland
,
Hattiesburg
was
hit
very
hard
in
0000
by
Hurricane
Katrina
.

Around
00,000
structures
in
the
area
received
major
damage
of
some
type
.

Approximately
00
percent
of
the
city
's
roads
were
blocked
by
trees
and
power
was
out
in
the
area
for
up
to
00
days
.

The
storm
killed
00
people
in
Hattiesburg
and
the
surrounding
areas
.

The
city
is
strained
by
a
large
influx
of
temporary
evacuees
and
new
permanent
residents
from
coastal
Louisiana
and
Mississippi
towns
to
the
south
,
where
damage
from
Katrina
was
catastrophic
.

The
City
is
also
known
for
its
police
department
,
as
it
was
the
first
—
and
for
almost
a
decade
the
only
—
Commission
on
Accreditation
for
Law
Enforcement
Agencies
federally
accredited
law
enforcement
agency
in
the
State
of
Mississippi
.

The
department
is
serviced
by
its
own
training
academy
,
which
has
traditionally
been
one
of
the
most
difficult
basic
academies
in
the
country
with
over
a
00
%
attrition
rate
.

The
Hattiesburg
Zoo
at
Kamper
Park
is
a
longstanding
tourist
attraction
in
the
city
.

In
0000
,
Hattiesburg
was
named
one
of
America
's
Great
Places
by
the
American
Planning
Association
.

APA
's
flagship
program
celebrates
places
of
exemplary
character
,
quality
,
and
planning
.

Places
are
selected
annually
and
represent
the
gold
standard
in
terms
of
having
a
true
sense
of
place
,
cultural
and
historical
interest
,
community
involvement
,
and
a
vision
for
tomorrow
.

APA
Great

offer
better
choices
for
where
and
how
people
work
and
live
.

They
are
enjoyable
,
safe

.

They
are
places
where
people
want
to
be
—
not
only
to
visit
,
but
to
live
and
work
every
day
.

America
's
truly

are
defined
by
many
criteria
,
including
architectural
features
,
accessibility
,
functionality
,
and
community
involvement
.

Hattiesburg
is
home
to
Southern
charm
and
friendly
neighbors
who
come
together
to
help
each
other
out
.

The
Miss
Hospitality
Pageant
began
in
0000
.

Hattiesburg
received
sponsorship
of
the
state
pageant
in
December
0000
.

The
purpose
of
the
pageant
is
the
identification
and
presentation
of
a
young
and
knowledgeable
lady
to
help
promote
the
state
in
tourism
and
economic
development
.

Claire
Reynolds
who
is
a
junior

University
of
Southern
Mississippi
majoring
in
elementary

Civil
rights
movement
Hattiesburg
and
the
unincorporated
African
American
community
of
Palmers
Crossing
played
a
key
role
in
the
civil
rights
struggles
of
the
0000s
.

In
0000
,
black
Korean
War
veteran
Clyde
Kennard
applied
to
attend
then
all-white
Mississippi
Southern
College
(
today
University
of
Southern
Mississippi
)
.

He
was
denied
admission
on
account
of
his
race
,
and
when
he
persisted
,
the
Mississippi
State
Sovereignty
Commission
conspired
to
have
him
framed
for
a
crime
,
for
which
he
was
sentenced
to
seven
years
in
Parchman
Prison
.

For
years
,
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
leaders
Medgar
Evers
,
Vernon
Dahmer
and
other
Forrest
County
civil
rights
activists
fought
to
overturn
the
conviction
.

Forrest
County
Registrar
Theron
Lynd
prevented
blacks
from
registering
to
vote
.

Thirty
percent
of
the
population
was
black
,
but
less
than
0
%
of
them
were
on
the
voting
rolls
,
while
white
registration
was
close
to
000
%
.

In
0000
,
the
U.S.
Justice
Department
filed
suit
against
Lynd
and
he
became
the
first
southern
registrar
to
be
convicted
under
the
Civil
Rights
Act
of
0000
for
systematically
violating
African
American
voting
rights
.

In
0000
,
Student
Nonviolent
Coordinating
Committee
began
one
of
its
first
voter-registration
projects
in
Hattiesburg
under
the
auspices
of
Council
of
Federated
Organizations
)
.

By
0000
,
the
Delta
Ministry
was
active
in
the
city
.

In
cooperation
with
the
NAACP
and
local
civil
rights
leaders
,
they
formed
the
Forrest
County
Voters
League
.

In
conjunction
with
the
0000
elections
,
civil
rights
leaders
organized
a
statewide
"
Freedom
Ballot
,
"
a
mock
election
that
demonstrated
both
the
state-wide
pattern
of
voting
rights
discrimination
and
the
strong
desire
of
Mississippi
blacks
for
full
citizenship
.

Despite
the
serious
risk
of
both
physical
and
economic
retaliation
,
almost
half
of
Forrest
County
blacks
participated
,
the
highest
turnout
in
the
state
.

January
00
,
0000
,
was
"
Freedom
Day
"
in
Hattiesburg
,
a
major
voter
registration
effort
supported
by
student
demonstrators
and
00
northern
clergymen
.

For
the
first
time
since
Reconstruction
,
an
inter-racial
protest
was
allowed
to
picket
the
courthouse
for
voting
rights
without
being
arrested
.

Roughly
000
African
Americans
attempted
to
register
,
though
only
a
few
were
allowed
into
the
courthouse
and
fewer
still
were
added
to
the
rolls
.

Each
day
thereafter
for
many
months
the
courthouse
protest
was
resumed
in
what
became
known
as
the
"
Perpetual
Picket
.
"

During
Freedom
Summer
in
0000
,
the
Hattiesburg/Palmers
Crossing
project
was
the
headquarters
for
all
civil
rights
activity
in
the
0th
Congressional
District
and
the
largest
and
most
active
site
in
the
state
with
more
than
00
volunteers
and
0,000
local
participants
.

Hundreds
of
Forrest
County
blacks
tried
to
register
to
vote
at
the
courthouse
,
but
most
were
prevented
from
doing
so
.

More
than
000
children
and
adults
attended
one
of
the
seven
Freedom
Schools
in
Hattiesburg
and
Palmers
Crossing
,
three
freedom
libraries
were
set
up
with
donated
books
,
and
a
community
center
was
established
.

Many
whites
opposed
civil
rights
efforts
by
blacks
,
and
both
summer
volunteers
and
local
African
Americans
endured
arrests
,
beatings
,
firings
,
and
evictions
.

Forrest
County
was
also
a
center
of
activity
for
the
Mississippi
Freedom
Democratic
Party
(
MFDP
)
which
sent
a
slate
of
delegates
to
the
Democratic
Convention
in
Atlantic
City
to
challenge
the
seating
of
the
all-white
,
pro-segregation
delegates
elected
by
the
regular
party
in
primaries
in
which
African
Americans
could
not
participate
.

Victoria
Jackson
Gray
of
Palmers
Crossing
ran
on
the
MFDP
ticket
against
incumbent
Senator
John
Stennis
and
John
Cameron
of
Hattiesburg
ran
for
Representative
in
the
0th
District
.

With
blacks
still
denied
the
vote
,
they
knew
they
could
not
be
elected
,
but
their
candidacies
and
campaigns
advanced
the
struggle
for
voting
rights
.

On
the
night
of
January
00
,
0000
,
the
White
Knights
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
attacked
the
Hattiesburg
home
of
NAACP
leader
Vernon
Dahmer
with
firebombs
and
gunfire
.

Dahmer
was
the
most
prominent
black
leader
in
the
county
and
been
the
primary
civil
rights
leader
for
many
years
.

Just
prior
to
the
attack
,
he
had
announced
that
he
would
help
pay
a
$
0
poll
tax
for
black
voters
too
poor
to
do
so
themselves
.

Dahmer
held
off
the
Klan
with
his
rifle
to
give
his
wife
,
their
three
young
children
,
and
elderly
aunt
time
to
escape
their
burning
home
,
but
he
died
of
burns
and
smoke
inhalation
the
next
day
.

His
murder
sparked
large
protest
marches
in
Hattiesburg
.

A
number
of
Klansmen
were
arrested
for
the
crime
and
four
were
eventually
convicted
.

After
four
previous
trials
had
ended
in
deadlocks
,
KKK
Imperial
Wizard
Samuel
Bowers
was
finally
convicted
in
August
0000
for
ordering
the
assassination
of
Dahmer
.

He
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
.

Vela
Uniform/Project
Dribble
nuclear
tests
Vela
Uniform
was
an
element
of
Project
Vela
conducted
jointly
by
the
United
States
Department
of
Energy
and
the
Advanced
Research
Projects
Agency
.

Its
purpose
was
to
develop
seismic
methods
for
detecting
underground
nuclear
testing
.

The
Project
Dribble
program
involved
two
nuclear
detonations
.

Test
SALMON
occurred
on
October
00
,
0000
,
with
a
0.0
kiloton
yield
;
test
STERLING
was
detonated
December
0
,
0000
,
with
a
yield
of
000
tons
.

Both
detonations
took
place
within
Tatum
Salt
Dome
,
southwest
of
the
Hattiesburg
/
Purvis
area
.

Geography
Hattiesburg
is

Most
of
Hattiesburg
is
in
Forrest
County
.

A
smaller
portion
on
the
west
side
is
in
Lamar
County
with
more
of
the
abundant
commercial
land
added
in
a
0000
annexation
.

This
consists
of
first

a
narrow
stretch
of
land
lying
east
of

second
,
of
an
irregularly-shaped
extension
into

Hattiesburg
is
about

.

Climate
Hattiesburg
has
a
humid
subtropical
climate
,
with
short

Snowfall
is
extremely
rare
,
but
on
December
00
,
0000
,
areas
around
Hattiesburg
received
0
to
0
inches
.

As
is
the
case
throughout
the
southern
USA
,
severe
thunderstorms
can
pose
a
threat
,
particularly
during
spring
.

Such
storms
spawn
frequent
lightning
,
heavy
rain
,
occasional
large
hail
and
tornadoes
.

A
recent
tornado
to
affect
the
Hattiesburg
area
was
the
EF0
that
struck
on
February
00
,
0000
,
between
roughly
0:00
p.m.
and
0:00
p.m.
CST
.

This
tornado
formed
in
Lamar
County
just
west
of
Oak
Grove
and
quickly
increased
in
size
and
intensity
.

Although
the
most
severe
damage
occurred
in
the
Oak
Grove
area
especially
near
Oak
Grove
High
School
,
the
tornado
continued
eastward
into
Hattiesburg
causing
widespread
EF0-EF0
damage
to
the
southern
portion
of
the
University
of
Southern
Mississippi
campus
and
the
areas
just
north
of
downtown
,
before
heading
into
neighboring
Petal
,
Mississippi
and
rural
Forrest
County
.

No
fatalities
and
over
00
injuries
were
reported
,
which
was
attributed
to
the
nearly
00
minute
tornado
warning
lead
time
.

Fatal
Attraction
is
a
0000
American
psychological
thriller
film
directed
by
Adrian
Lyne
and
starring
Michael
Douglas
,
Glenn
Close
,
and
Anne
Archer
.

The
film
centers
around
a
married
man
who
has
a
weekend
affair
with
a
woman
who
refuses
to
allow
it
to
end
,
resulting
in
emotional
blackmail
,
stalking
,
and
an
ensuing
obsession
on
her
part
.

The
film
was
adapted
by
James
Dearden
and
Nicholas
Meyer
from
an
earlier
0000
short
film
by
Dearden
for
British
television
,
Diversion
.

Fatal
Attraction
was
a
hit
,
becoming
the
second
highest-grossing
film
of
0000
in
the
United
States
and
the
highest-grossing
film
of
the
year
worldwide
.

Critics
were
enthusiastic
about
the
film
,
and
it
received
six
Academy
Award
nominations
,
including
that
for
Best
Picture
,
Best
Actress
for
Close
and
Best
Supporting
Actress
for
Archer
.

Plot
Dan
Gallagher
(
Michael
Douglas
)
is
a
successful
,
happily
married
New
York
attorney
living
in
Manhattan
when
he
meets
Alexandra
"
Alex
"
Forrest
(
Glenn
Close
)
,
an
editor
for
a
publishing
company
,
through
business
.

While
his
wife
,
Beth
(
Anne
Archer
)
,
and
daughter
,
Ellen
(
Ellen
Hamilton
Latzen
)
,
are
out
of
town
for
the
weekend
,
he
has
a
passionate
affair
with
Alex.
Though
he
thought
it
was
understood
to
be
a
simple
fling
,
she
begins
clinging
to
him
.

Dan
explains
that
he
must
go
home
and
Alex
cuts
her
wrists
in
a
suicide
attempt
.

He
helps
her
to
bandage
them
and
later
leaves
.

He
thinks
the
affair
is
forgotten
,
but
she
shows
up
at
various
places
to
see
him
.

She
waits
at
his
office
one
day
to
apologize
and
invite
him
to
the
opera
,
but
he
turns
her
down
.

She
then
continues
to
telephone
until
he
tells
his
secretary
that
he
will
no
longer
take
her
calls
.

She
then
phones
his
home
at
all
hours
,
and
then
confronts
him
saying
that
she
is
pregnant
and
plans
to
keep
the
baby
.

Although
he
wants
nothing
to
do
with
her
,
she
argues
that
he
must
take
responsibility
.

She
shows
up
at
his
apartment
(
which
is
for
sale
)
and
meets
Beth
,
feigning
interest
as
a
buyer
.

Later
that
night
,
he
goes
to
her
apartment
to
confront
her
about
her
actions
which
results
in
a
violent
scuffle
.

In
response
,
she
replies
that
she
will
not
be
ignored
.

Dan
moves
his
family
to
Bedford
,
but
this
does
n't
deter
Alex.
She
has
a
tape
recording
delivered
to
him
filled
with
verbal
abuse
.

She
stalks
him
in
a
parking
garage
,
pours
acid
on
his
vehicle
,
and
follows
him
home
one
night
to
spy
on
him
,
Beth
,
and
Ellen
from
the
bushes
in
their
yard
;
the
sight
of
their
family
life
literally
makes
her
sick
to
her
stomach
.

Her
obsession
escalates
further
.

Dan
approaches
the
police
to
apply
for
a
restraining
order
against
her
(
claiming
that
it
is
"
for
a
client
"
)
,
to
which
the
lieutenant
claims
that
he
can
not
violate
her
rights
without
probable
cause
and
that
the
adulterer
has
to
own
up
to
his
adultery
.

At
one
point
,
while
the
Gallaghers
are
not
home
,
Alex
kills
Ellen
's
pet
rabbit
,
and
puts
it
on
their
stove
to
boil
.

After
this
,
Dan
tells
Beth
of
the
affair
and
Alex
's
pregnancy
.

Enraged
,
she
asks
him
to
leave
.

Before
he
goes
,
Dan
calls
Alex
to
tell
her
that
Beth
knows
about
the
affair
.

Beth
gets
on
the
phone
and
warns
Alex
that
if
she
persists
,
she
(
Beth
)
will
kill
her
.

Without
Dan
and
Beth
's
knowledge
,
Alex
picks
up
Ellen
at
school
and
takes
her
to
an
amusement
park
,
buying
her
ice
cream
as
well
as
taking
her
on
a
roller
coaster
.

Beth
panics
when
she
realizes
that
she
does
n't
know
where
Ellen
is
.

She
drives
around
searching
and
rear-ends
a
car
stopped
at
an
intersection
and
is
slightly
injured
and
hospitalized
.

Alex
later
drops
Ellen
off
at
the
Gallaghers
'
house
,
asking
Ellen
for
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
.

Dan
barges
into
Alex
's
apartment
and
attacks
her
,
choking
her
and
coming
close
to
strangling
her
.

He
stops
himself
,
but
as
he
does
she
lunges
at
him
with
a
kitchen
knife
.

He
overpowers
her
,
but
puts
the
knife
down
and
leaves
,
with
Alex
leaning
against
the
kitchen
counter
,
smiling
.

He
approaches
the
police
about
having
her
arrested
,
and
they
start
searching
for
Alex
to
bring
her
in
for
taking
Ellen
.

Following
her
release
from
the
hospital
,
Beth
forgives
Dan
and
they
return
home
.

Beth
prepares
a
bath
for
herself
and
Alex
suddenly
appears
,
again
with
the
kitchen
knife
.

She
starts
to
explain
her
resentment
of
her
,
nervously
fidgeting
(
which
causes
her
to
cut
her
own
leg
)
and
then
attacks
her
.

Dan
hears
the
screaming
and
runs
in
,
wrestles
Alex
into
the
bathtub
and
seemingly
drowns
her
.

She
suddenly
emerges
from
the
water
,
swinging
the
knife
.

Beth
,
who
went
searching
for
Dan
's
gun
,
shoots
her
in
the
chest
,
killing
her
.

The
final
scene
shows
police
cars
outside
the
Gallaghers
'
house
.

As
Dan
finishes
talking
with
the
cops
,
he
walks
inside
,
where
Beth
is
waiting
for
him
.

They
embrace
and
proceed
upstairs
as
the
camera
focuses
on
a
picture
of
Dan
,
Beth
,
and
Ellen
.

Alternate
ending
Alex
Forrest
was
originally
scripted
to
die
by
suicide
at
the
film
's
end
by
slashing
her
throat
.

Her
plan
was
to
make
it
look
as
if
Dan
had
murdered
her
,
for
which
he
would
be
arrested
.

Although
Beth
is
shown
to
possibly
have
a
way
to
free
him
when
finding
a
revealing
tape
that
Alex
had
sent
him
and
taking
it
to
the
police
,
test
audience
s
did
not
respond
well
.

This
resulted
in
a
three-week
reshoot
for
the
action-filled
sequence
in
the
bathroom
and
Alex
's
death
by
gunshot
.

Her
shooting
by
Beth
juxtaposes
the
two
characters
,
with
Alex
becoming
the
victim
and
Beth
taking
violent
action
to
protect
her
family
.

In
the
0000
Special
Edition
DVD
,
Close
comments
that
she
had
concerns
re-shooting
the
film
's
ending
because
she
believed
the
character
would
"
self-destruct
and
commit
suicide
.
"

Close
's
opinion
was
also
corroborated
by
psychiatrists
.

However
,
Close
gave
in
on
her
concerns
,
and
filmed
the
new
sequence
after
having
fought
against
the
change
for
two
weeks
.

The
film
was
initially
released
in
Japan
with
the
original
ending
.

The
original
ending
also
appeared
on
a
special
edition
VHS
and
LaserDisc
release
by
Paramount
in
0000
,
and
was
included
on
the
film
's
DVD
release
a
decade
later
.

During
the
film
's
release
,
the
critical
media
,
who
knew
about
the
alternate
ending
,
tried
to
portray
Alex
as
a
victim
discarded
by
a
somewhat
callous
lover
,
but
audiences
would
have
none
of
it
,
and
the
idea
of
Alex
as
a
"
victim
"
rather
than
a
psycho
was
eventually
completely
dropped
.

Cast
Reaction
After
its
release
,
Fatal
Attraction
engendered
much
discussion
of
the
potential
consequences
of
infidelity
.

Feminists
,
meanwhile
,
did
not
appreciate
Alex
's
depiction
as
a
strong
career
woman
who
is
at
the
same
time
profoundly
psychotic
.

Feminist
Susan
Faludi
discussed
the
film
in
Backlash
,
arguing
that
major
changes
had
been
made
to
the
original
plot
in
order
to
make
Alex
wholly
negative
,
while
Dan
's
carelessness
and
the
lack
of
compassion
and
responsibility
raised
no
discussion
,
except
for
a
small
number
of
fundamentalist
men
's
groups
who
said
that
Dan
was
eventually
forced
to
own
up
to
his
irresponsibility
in
that
"
everyone
pays
the
piper
"
.

The
film
has
also
had
an
effect
on
men
.

Glenn
Close
was
quoted
in
0000
as
saying
,
"
Men
still
come
up
to
me
and
say
,
'
You
scared
the
shit
out
of
me
.
'

Sometimes
they
say
,
'
You
saved
my
marriage
.
'
"

The
film
grossed
$
000.0
million
and
was
the
second
highest-grossing
film
of
0000
behind
Three
Men
and
a
Baby
.

Much
of
the
film
's
plot
was
spoofed
in
the
0000
comedy
Fatal
Instinct
.

Psychiatric
diagnosis
The
film
's
female
lead
has
been
discussed
by
psychiatrists
and
film
experts
,
and
has
been
used
as
a
film
illustration
for
the
condition
borderline
personality
disorder
.

The
character
displays
the
behaviors
of
impulsivity
,
emotional
lability
,
frantic
efforts
to
avoid
abandonment
,
frequent
severe
anger
,
self-harming
,
changing
from
idealization
to
devaluation
,
consistent
with
the
diagnosis
,
although
generally
aggression
to
the
self
rather
than
others
is
a
more
common
feature
in
borderline
personality
disorder
.

As
referenced
in

Kamirs
'
Every
Breath
You
Take
:

Narratives
and
the
Law
,
"
Glenn
Close
's
character
Alex
is
quite
deliberately
made
to
be
an
erotomaniac
.

Gelder
reports
that
Glenn
Close
'
consulted
three
separate
shrinks
for
an
inner
profile
of
her
character
,
who
is
meant

suffering
from

form
of

condition
known

Bunny
boiler
The

into
popular
parlance
as
a
term
for
a
jealous
mistress
,
based
on
the
film
's
infamous
rabbit
boiling
scene
.

The
phrase
's

was

Fairborn
is
a
city
in
Greene
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
near
Dayton
and
Wright-Patterson
Air
Force
Base
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
claims
to
be
the
only
city
in
the
world
with
the
name
of
Fairborn
,
a
portmanteau
word
created
from
the
names
Fairfield
and
Osborn
;
the
two
villages
that
merged
in
0000
after
the
Great
Dayton
Flood
of
0000
forced
Osborn
to
move
out
of
a
flood
plain
and
alongside
Fairfield
.

Fairborn
is
the
home
of
Wright
State
University
.

Dayton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Fairborn
is
also
home
to
the
disaster
training
facility
known
as
Calamityville
.

History
Fairborn
was
formed
from
the
union
of
the
two
villages
of
Fairfield
and
Osborn
.

Fairfield
was
originally
founded
in
0000
and
Osborn
in
0000
.

Before
European
settlers
arrived
,
native
inhabitants
of
the
region
included
the
Adena
culture
of
Ohio
and
nearby
states
,
and
the
subsequent
Hopewell
culture
known
from
Illinois
to
Ohio
and
renowned
for
their
geometric
earthworks
.

Several
surviving
examples
of
earthen
mounds
made
by
Mound
builders
still
exist
at
the
Wright
Brother
's
Memorial
atop
the
bluff
overlooking
Huffman
Prairie
,
and
another
lies
on
the
grounds
of
the
base
.

The
area
of
the
village
of
Fairfield
was
settled
before
Ohio
was
a
state
.

The
first
log
cabin
was
built
by
George
Greiner
in
0000
.

The
area
where
the
village
would
grow
was
favorable
to
pioneers
who
were
moving
northward
and
westward
from
Kentucky
and
Virginia
.

Often
there
were
raids
made
upon
the
settlement
by
local
Indians
,
followed
by
similar
raids
on
local
native
settlements
.

Although
no
massacres
took
place
,
both
sides
engaged
in
taking
prisoners
.

There
are
two
accounts
regarding
the
name
"
Fairfield
"
.

One
more
accepted
account
claims
that
a
local
Native
American
-
possibly
a
Shawnee
-
tribal
chief
,
in
speaking
to
one
of
the
town
's
leaders
after
making
peace
and
exchanging
prisoners
,
said
to
William
Cozad
that
when
he
looked
out
from
Reed
's
Hill
over
the
town
,
The
other
possible
source
for
the
name
is
after
a
Fairfield
in
England
.

Osborn
was
a
town
(
no
longer
existing
)
located
near
the
Haddix
Road-Ohio
000
intersection
at
the
northern
edge
of
Wright-Patterson
Air
Force
Base
in
what
is
now
the
flood-prone
basin
of
the
Huffman
Dam
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Ohio
.

Osborn
was
named
after
the
superintendent
of
the
railroad
named
E.F.
Osborn
.

The
previously
unnamed
town
allowed
the
railroad
to
be
built
through
it
after
the
nearby
town
of
Fairfield
refused
the
plan
of
the
railway
to

Huffman
Prairie
,
part
of
Dayton
Aviation
Heritage
National
Historical
Park
,
is
an
00
acre
(
.00
km
²
)
patch
of
rough
pasture
that
was
outside
the
village
of
Fairfield
(
now
known
as
Huffman
Prairie
Flying
Field
)
,
where
the
Wright
Brothers
undertook
the
difficult
and
sometimes
dangerous
task
of
creating
a
dependable
,
fully
controllable
airplane
and
training
themselves
to
be
pilots
.

After
they
began
making
use
of
Huffman
Prairie
in
0000
,
the
Wright
brothers
made
hundreds
of
flights
here
after
developing
the
0000
Wright
Flyer
III
(
the
plane
they
considered
to
be
the
first
practical
airplane
)
,
testing
the
aircraft
built
by
the
Wright
Company
.

At
the
Wright
Flying
School
,
also
located
here
,
they
trained
more
than
a
hundred
pilots
,
including
the
flyers
for
the
Wright
Exhibition
Team
and
the
first
military
flyers
,
including
Henry
H.
Arnold
and
Thomas
DeWitt
Milling
.

The
United
States
Army
Signal
Corps
purchased
the
field
in
0000
and
renamed
it
,
along
with
adjacent
(
0
km
²
)
,
Wilbur
Wright
Field
.

In
0000
the
area
was
merged
with
nearby
Patterson
Field
and
became
Wright-Patterson
Air
Force
Base
.

In
0000
nearly
the
entire
town
of
Osborn
,
along
with
the
railroad
(
now
Norfolk
Southern
Railway
)
,
were
relocated
two
miles
away
during
construction
of
the
Huffman
Dam
on
the
Mad
River
to
a
site
east
of
and
adjacent
to
Fairfield
.

This
was
necessary
because
of
the
Miami
Valley
Flood
Control
Project
and
the
Miami
Conservancy
District
that
was
begun
after
the
Great
Dayton
Flood
(
Dayton
,
Ohio
)
of
March
,
0000
.

The
village
decided
to
move
homes
out
of
the
flood
plain
on
flatbed
trucks
and
settle
alongside
Fairfield
.

Growth
of
the
two
villages
was
hindered
by
the
other
's
borders
,
a
military
flying
field
and
depot
(
now
Wright-Patterson
Air
Force
Base
)
,
township
borders
,
and
county
borders
.

The
two
villages
voted
to
merge
in
0000
and
officially
merged
in
0000
The
first
business
to
depict
the
name
of
the
new
city
was
the
large
vertical
sign
of
the
Fairborn
Theatre
.

From
0000-0000
the
city
experienced
explosive
growth
to
six
times
its
former
population
,
surpassing
Xenia
(
the
county
seat
)
as
the
most
populous
city
in
the
county
,
due
largely
to
the
local
employment
opportunities
made
available
by
the
nearby
Air
Force
Base
.

Another
employer
,
Southwestern
Portland
Cement
,
operated
the
largest
factory
in
the
city
during
this
period
,
mining
the
locally-exposed
Brassfield
Formation
.

The
development
of
Interstate
000
(
Ohio
)
began
in
the
0000s
to
serve
as
an
eastern
bypass
of
Dayton
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
construction
began
on
the
northernmost
part
of
I-000
,
just
east
of
Fairborn
.

The
first
segment
terminated
at
N.
Fairfield
Road
(
exit
00
)
.

No
further
construction
was
done
for
over
a
decade
and
it
was
jokingly
referred
to
by
some
as
"
Fairborn
's
private
Interstate
"
.

Dayton
Mayor
James
H.
McGee
opposed
the
highway
,
contending
it
would
draw
economic
development
out
of
the
city
into
the
suburbs
.

I-000
was
eventually
completed
by
0000
.

Fairborn
's
growth
slowed
significantly
in
the
0000s
and
has
only
resumed
at
a
moderate
pace
since
the
late
0000s
.

It
has
since
been
surpassed
by
neighboring
Beavercreek
,
Ohio
in
population
.

In
local
history
,
The
Fairborn
Agreement
,
a
peace
accord
between
the
parties
to
the
hostilities
of
the
conflict
in
Bosnia-Herzegovina
and
the
former
Yugoslavia
,
was
negotiated
at
Wright-Patterson
Air
Force
Base
.

Negotiations
took
place
from
November
0
,
0000
,
to
November
00
,
0000
,
at
Wright-Patterson
Air
Force
Base
located
next
to
Fairborn
,
Ohio
.

As
of
0000
,
Fairborn
is
a
quiet
town
with
many
still
working
at
the
nearby
Wright
Patterson
Air

Base
,
the
home
of
the
Air

Materiel

and
in
many
measures
the

small
cluster
of
buildings
it
has

Xenia
is
a

00
miles
from
Dayton
and
is
part
of
the
Dayton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
,
as
well
as
the
Miami
Valley
region
.

The
name
comes
from
the
Greek
word
Xenia
(
ξενία
)
,
which
means
"
hospitality
"
.

Many
of
its
residents
supported
the
Underground
Railroad
in
the
years
before
the
Civil
War
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
had
a
population
of
00,000
.

Xenia
is
the
third
largest
city
in
Greene
County
,
behind
Fairborn

Beavercreek
.

By
population
,
it
is
the
largest
place
in
the
United
States
whose
name
begins
with
the
letter
X
.

History
Xenia
was
founded
in
0000
,
the
year
Ohio
was
admitted
into
the
Union
.

In
that
year
,
pioneer
John
Paul
bought
of
land
from
Thomas
and
Elizabeth
Richardson
of
Hanover
County
,
Virginia
,
for
"
0000
pounds
current
moneys
of
Virginia
.
"

Paul
influenced
county
commissioners
to
locate
the
town
seat
on
this
land
at
the
forks
of
the
Shawnee
Creeks
.

Joseph
C.
Vance
was
named
to
survey
the
site
and
lay
out
the
town
.

The
following
year
,
he
bought
the
town
site
of
from
John
Paul
for
$
000
.

The
name
of
the
new
village
was
chosen
in
typically
democratic
fashion
.

Vance
called
a
town
meeting
to
discuss
possible
names
.

The
committee
had
considered
several
suggestions
without
reaching
any
decision
.

Then
the
Rev.
Robert
Armstrong
proposed
the
name
"
Xenia
,
"
meaning
"
hospitality
"
in
Greek
,
because
of
the
fine
hospitality
extended
to
him
in
this
friendly
community
.

When
a
tie
vote
developed
,
Laticia
Davis
,
wife
of
Owen
Davis
,
was
invited
to
cast
the
deciding
ballot
.

She
voted
for
"
Xenia
.
"

The
first
session
of
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
created
Greene
County
from
the
Northwest
Territory
,
embracing
the
homeland
of
the
Shawnee
Indians
.

Their
chief
tribal
village
was
north
of
Xenia
at
old
Chillicothe
,
now
called
Old
Town
.

The
Shawnee
war
chief
Tecumseh
was
born
there
in
0000
.

William
Beattie
was
Xenia
's
first
businessman
.

In
0000
,
he
opened
a
tavern
which
became
a
center
of
community
affairs
.

In
0000
,
John
Marshall
built
Xenia
's
first
home
.

The
first
log
school
house
was
constructed
in
0000
,
and
,
that
same
year
,
Rev.
James
Towler
became
the
town
's
first
postmaster
.

The
growing
community
soon
attracted
many
pioneer
industries
-
flour
mills
,
sawmills
,
woolen
mills
,
pork
packing
plants
,
oil
mills
,
and
tow
mills
.

Xenia
was
incorporated
by
an
act
of
the
legislature
in
0000
and
became
a
city
in
0000
.

However
,
it
was
the
arrival
of
the
Little
Miami
Railroad
(
now
the
site
of
the
Little
Miami
Scenic
Trail
,
which
passes
through
Xenia
Station
)
in
0000
which
gave
the
city
its
first
industrial
impetus
.

On
March
0
,
0000
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
rode
from
Columbus
,
Ohio
to
Xenia
and
back
on
the
newly
completed
Columbus
and
Xenia
Railroad
.

President-Elect
Abraham
Lincoln
made
a
brief
appearance
in
the
city
as
his
inaugural
train
traveled
from
Cincinnati
to
Columbus
on
Wednesday
morning
,
February
00
,
0000
.

He
gave
a
short
speech
which
was
not
recorded
by
the
traveling
writer
from
the
New
York
Times
as
it
echoed
the
same
sentiments
that
he
had
expressed
before
in
his
previous
stops
.

According
to
the
Times
writer
,
"
a
very
large
crowd
assembled
,
and
amid
the
firing
of
a
cannon
and
enthusiasm
,
Mr.
Lincoln
addressed
them
from
the
rear
car
,
reiterating
what
he
had
said
before

The
town
progressed
rapidly
during
the
mid-00th
century
.

Artificial
gas
was
provided
in
the
0000s
and
continued
in
use
until
natural
gas
was
made
available
in
0000
.

The
first
fire
engine
house
was
built
in
0000
;
the
telephone
came
to
Xenia
in
0000
;
electricity
in
0000
and
a
water
works
system
in
0000
.

Xenia
opened
its
first
free
public
library
in
0000
.

By
0000
the
city
was
operating
its
own
sewage
system
.

Xenia
elected
Cornelius
Clark
as
its
first
mayor
in
0000
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
the
commission-manager
plan
succeeded
the
old
form
of
municipal
government
.

The
Xenia
of
today
still
operates
under
this
commission-manager
system
.

Tornadoes
Xenia
has
a
history
of
severe
storm
activity
.

According
to
local
legend
,
the
area
was
referred
to
by
Shawnee
Indians
as
"
the
place
of
the
devil
wind
"
or
"
the
land
of
the
crazy
winds
"
(
depending
upon
the
translation
)
.

Records
of
storms
go
back
to
the
early
00th
century
.

Local
records
show
00
tornadoes
in
Greene
County
since
0000
.

On
April
0
,
0000
a
tornado
rated
F0
on
the
Fujita
scale
cut
a
path
directly
through
the
middle
of
Xenia
during
the
Super
Outbreak
,
the
second
largest
series
of
tornadoes
in
recorded
history
.
.

Five
schools
,
including
Xenia
High
School
,
Central
Junior
High
School
,
McKinley
Elementary
,
Simon
Kenton
Elementary
,
and
Saint
Brigid
Catholic
School
were
destroyed
.

Also
destroyed
were
nine
churches
and
000
businesses
.

The
city
's
plight
was
featured
in
the
national
news
,
including
a
0000
NBC
television
documentary
,
Tornado
!

,
hosted
by
Floyd
Kalber
.

President
Richard
Nixon
visited
stricken
areas
of
Xenia
following
the
devastation
.

Comedian
Bob
Hope
organized
a
benefit
for
Xenia
and
,
in
appreciation
,
the
new
Xenia
High
School
Auditorium
was
named
the
"
Bob
Hope
Auditorium
.
"

In
recognition
of
their
coverage
of
this
tornado
,
the
staff
of
the
Xenia
Daily
Gazette
won
the
Pulitzer
Prize
for
spot
news
reporting
in
0000
.

Xenia
was
struck
by
a
much
smaller
tornado
in
April
,
0000
and
again
by
another
F0
tornado
on
September
00
,
0000
.

The
0000
tornado
caused
over
$
0
million
in
damage
,
but
no
one
was
killed
.

The
twister
of
0000
left
one
person
killed
,
and
000
people
injured
.

This
tornado
followed
a
path
roughly
parallel
to
the
0000
tornado
.

Xenia
currently
has
a
system
of
tornado
sirens
.

After
the
0000
tornado
outbreak
,
the
city
purchased
a
system
of
Federal
Thunderbolt
Sirens
for
warning
.

During
the
0000
tornado
strike
,
the
lack
of
backup
power
silenced
the
sirens
,
so
the
city
purchased
Federal
Signal
0000-SRN
series
sirens
with
battery
backup
.

Most
of
Xenia
's
old
sirens
are
still
standing
,
but
not
operational
.

Railroads
In
0000
,
Xenia
had
three
freight
railroads
that
ran
through
town
.

Today
there
are
none
,
with
the
last
track
sections
abandoned
and
ripped
up
in
0000
.

The
freight
rail
lines
that
served
the
city
of
Xenia
were
:
The
rights-of-way
of
five
of
Xenia
's
six
rail
tracks
have
been
converted
to
rail-trails
.

The
one
exception
,
the
B&O
line
west
of
town
,
is
not
a
separate
trail
because
it
closely
paralleled
the
Pennsylvania
mainline
,
running
side-by-side
for
much
of
the
way
.

With
so
many
trails
in
town
,
a
water
tower
refers
to
Xenia
as
the
"
Bicycle
Capital
of
the
Midwest
"
.

Xenia
was
also
served
by
two
interurban
railways
:
the
Dayton
and
Xenia
Transit
Company
,
and
the
Springfield
and
Xenia
Railway
.

These
were
dismantled
in
the
0000s
or
earlier
.

Yellow
Springs
is
a
village
in
Greene
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
and
is
the
location
of
Antioch
College
and
Antioch
University
Midwest
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Dayton
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
In
0000
,
the
village
was
founded
by
William
Mills
and
approximately
000
families
,
followers
of
Robert
Owen
,
who
wanted
to
emulate
the
utopian
community
at
New
Harmony
,
Indiana
.

The
communitarian
efforts
dissolved
due
to
internal
conflicts
.

The
Little
Miami
Railroad
was
completed
in
0000
and
brought
increased
commerce
,
inhabitants
,
and
tourism
.

Antioch
College
was
founded
in
0000
by
the
Christian
Connection
,
and
began
operating
in
0000
with
the
distinguished
scholar
Horace
Mann
as
its
first
president
.

Arthur
E.
Morgan
was
the
innovative
president
of
Antioch
College
who
implemented
a
much-imitated
work-study
program
for
students
.

An
engineer
by
training
,
Morgan
became
head
of
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
in
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
's
Administration
.

Upon
his
return
to
Yellow
Springs
,
Morgan
was
a
key
leader
of
Quaker
intentional
community
developments
in
Ohio
and
North
Carolina
.

Antioch
College
was
closed
by
Antioch
University
in
0000
but
reopened
,
as
an
independent
college
,
in
0000
.

Yellow
Springs
was
one
of
the
final
stops
on
the
Underground
Railroad
,
due
in
large
part
to
the
abolitionist
reputation
of
Horace
Mann
.

The
Conway
Colony
,
a
group
of
00
freed
slaves
who
were
transported
by
Moncure
D.
Conway
,
the
abolitionist
son
of
their
former
owner
,
settled
in
the
village
in
0000
.

Wheeling
Gaunt
,
a
former
slave
who
purchased
his
own
freedom
,
came
to
Yellow
Springs
in
the
0000s
and
owned
a
substantial
amount
of
land
upon
his
death
in
0000
.

Gaunt
bequeathed
to
the
village
a
large
piece
of
land
on
its
western
side
,
requesting
that
the
rent
be
used
to
buy
flour
for
the
"
poor
and
worthy
widows
"
of
Yellow
Springs
.

Although
the
land
was
used
to
create
Gaunt
Park
,
and
thus
does
not
generate
rent
,
the
village
expanded
the
bequest
to
include
sugar
and
still
delivers
flour
and
sugar
to
the
village
's
widows
at
Christmas
time
,
a
tradition
that
generates
annual
media
coverage
.

During
the
Red
Scare
of
the
0000s
,
Yellow
Springs
and
Antioch
came
under
scrutiny
for
alleged
sympathies
to
the
Communist
Party
due
to
many
locals
'
support
of
free
political
expression
.

After
being
questioned
by
the
Ohio
House
Un-American
Activities
Committee
,
Antioch
president
Douglas
McGregor
released
a
statement
in
0000
that
"
Antioch
upholds
the
American
tradition
of
academic
freedom
.

This
means
the
right
to
hear
and
investigate
all
sides
of
any
question
,
including
the
question
of
Russia
and
Communism
"
.

By
the
late
0000s
and
early
00s
,
the
village
became
a
center
for
the
civil
rights
and
anti-war
movements
in
southwestern
Ohio
,
creating
a
sociopolitical
demographic
change
which
remains
today
.

In
0000
,
Yellow
Springs
held
the
distinction
of
being
the
smallest
municipality
to
pass
an
ordinance
prohibiting
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
.

Hope
and
Glory
is
a
0000
British
comedy-drama
-
war
film
,
written
,
produced
and
directed
by
John
Boorman
,
and
based
on
his
own
experiences
of
growing
up
in
the
Blitz
in
London
during
World
War
II
.

The
title
from
the
traditional
British
patriotic
song
"
Land
of
Hope
and
Glory
"
.

The
film
was
distributed
by
Columbia
Pictures
.

Plot
Beginning
just
before
the
start
of
the
Second
World
War
,
the
film
tells
the
story
of
the
Rowan
family
:
Bill
,
his
sisters
Sue
and
Dawn
,
and
his
parents
Grace
and
Clive
,
living
in
a
suburb
of
London
.

After
the
war
starts
,
Clive
joins
the
army
,
leaving
Grace
alone
to
watch
over
the
children
.

Seen
through
the
eyes
of
00-year-old
Bill
,
the
"
fireworks
"
provided
by
the
Blitz
every
night
are
as
exciting
as
they
are
terrifying
.

His
family
do
not
see
things
in
quite
the
same
way
as
the
bombs
continue
to
drop
,
but
their
will
to
survive
brings
them
closer
together
.

The
nightly
raids
do
not
provide
the
only
drama
,
however
,
as
his
older
sister
,
Dawn
,
falls
for
a
Canadian
soldier
,
becomes
pregnant
,
and
finding
her
life
turned
upside
down
,
soon
discovers
the
value
of
her
family
.

The
family
eventually
moves
to
the
Thames-side
home
of
Grace
's
parents
when
their
house
burns
down
(
not
in
an
air
raid
,
but
in
an
ordinary
fire
)
.

This
provides
an
opportunity
for
Bill
to
spend
more
time
with
his
curmudgeonly
grandfather
.

Cast
Awards
The
film
received

The
film
was
nominated
for
the
prestigious
Grand
Prix
of
the
Belgian
Film
Critics
Association
.

Archival
film
The
"
newsreel
"
footage
shown
in
the
local
cinema
contains
scenes
from
the
0000
film
Battle
of
Britain
.

Critical
response
The
film
was
favourably
reviewed
by
critic
Pauline
Kael
in
her
film
reviews
collection
Hooked
.

It
's
hard
to
believe
that
a
great
comedy
could
be
made
of
the
Blitz
but
John
Boorman
has
done
it
.

In
his
new
,
autobiographical
film
,
he
has
had
the
inspiration
to
desentimentalise
wartime
England
and
show
us
the
Second
World
War
the
way
he
saw
it
as
an
eight
year
old
.

The
war
frees
the
Rowans
from
the
dismal
monotony
of
their
pinched
white-collar
lives
.

He
does
n't
deny
the
war
its
terrors
.

Yet
he
gives
everything
a
comic
fillip
.

That
's
the
joy
of
the
film
:
the
war
has
its
horrors
,
but
it
also
destroys
much
of
what
the
genteel
poor
like
Grace
Rowan
(
Sarah
Miles
)
,
have
barely
been
able
to
acknowledge
they
wanted
destroyed
.

It
's
like
a
plainspoken
,
English
variant
of
the
Taviani
brothers
'
The
Night
of
the
Shooting
Stars
.

Sequel
In
0000
,
John
Boorman
revealed
that
a
sequel
to
the
film
,
to
be
titled
Queen
and
Country
,
is
in
the
works
.

The
film
,
potentially
starring
Caleb
Landry
Jones
,
will
tell
the
story
of
an
older
soldier
during
the
Korean
War
.

.

History
In
0000
,
Col.
Ebenezer
Zane
received
funds
to
blaze
a
road
suitable
for
travel
by
horse
through
the
Ohio
wilderness
from
a
point
on
the
Ohio
River
opposite
Wheeling
,
Virginia
(
now
Wheeling
,
West
Virginia
)
to
another
point
opposite
Maysville
,
Kentucky
.

Where
this
road
,
known
as
Zane
's
Trace
,
crossed
Wills
Creek
,
a
ferry
was
established
in
0000
.

This
was
followed
by
the
first
bridge
authorized
by
the
legislature
of
the
Northwest
Territory
,
built
in
0000
.

The

0000
.

Both
Cambridge

having
inspired
the
naming
of
the
town
.

Also
in
0000
,
another
group
of
early
settlers
from
the
Isle
of
Guernsey
in
the
English
Channel
pitched
camp
in
Cambridge
,
reportedly
because
the
women
in
the
party
refused
to
move
on
.

The
county
for
which
Cambridge
serves
as
the
county
seat
was
later
named
in
honor
of
its
many
settlers
from
Guernsey
.

In
0000
,
the
federally
built
National
Road
came
through
Cambridge
.

The
first
railroad

Theft
indictment
In
July
0000
two
former
Arlington
Heights
employees
,
Donna
Covert
and
her
daughter
Laura
Jarvis
,
were
indicted
by
a
Hamilton
County
grand
jury
on
charges
relating
to
the
theft
of
roughly
$
000,000
from
village
coffers
from
0000
to
0000
.

The
charges
were
the
result
of
a
two-year
investigation
by
the
Ohio
Attorney
General
and
the
Ohio
State
Auditor
after
Robert
Lawson
,
the
Arlington
Heights
police
chief
,
reported
his
concerns
in
January
0000
.

Although
the
grand
jury
indictment
covers
only
the
0000
to
0000
time
span
,
some
former
officials
contend
that
cash
payments
of
fines
had
been
systematically
stolen
as
long
as
00
years
prior
.

Mark
Groteke
,
a
former
Arlington
Heights
police
chief
,
stated
,
"
They
were
stealing
money
.

We
knew
it
—
there
was
discussion
among
the
police
officers
—
we
knew
that
they
were
stealing
money
.
"

In
a
September
0000
letter
to
Mayor
Joseph
Harper
,
which
copied
Steve
Surber
(
then
the
village
treasurer
)
,
Groteke
discussed
"
...
the
possibility
that
citations
may
have
been
improperly
handled
"
,
and
recommended
"
...
an
outside
independent
agency
should
do
a
complete
audit
of
all
tickets
written
for
at
least
the
last
00
months
.
"

Despite
the
warning
,
no
action
was
taken
by
village
officials
.

Seeing
this
,
the
police
chief
requested
an
investigation
from
the
Ohio
Bureau
of
Criminal
Investigation
.

According
to
Groteke
,
the
investigation
was
not
launched
because
approval
from
either
the
mayor
or
the
treasurer
was
required
,
and
each
refused
to
endorse
an
investigation
.

In
0000
,
the
new
police
chief
,
Robert
Lawson
,
also
voiced
concerns
about
the
handling
of
money
within
the
village
.

He
sent
an
email
to
Surber
(
still
the
village
treasurer
)
,
saying
"
Just
a
quick
review
of
the
MUTT
book
,
your
numbers
do
n't
add
up
...
"
(
MUTT
stands
for
"
Multi-count
Uniform
Traffic
Ticket
"
.
)

Again
,
no
investigation
followed
.

When
asked
about
the
prior
letters
,
Surber
said
his
position
as
clerk
treasurer
did
not
give
him
the
power
to
call
for
an
investigation
.

In
0000
,
Hamilton
County
prosecutor
Joe
Deters
called
for
the
village
to
be
shut
down
.

He
said
,
"
The
Village
Council
needs
to
seriously
consider
dissolving
the
Village
of
Arlington
Heights
.

The
Village
seems
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
speed
trap
with
no
checks
and
balances
…
Consolidating
with
another
political
subdivision
is
long
overdue
.

Thirty-seven-year-old
Loretta
Castorini
(

,
an
Italian
American
widow
,
is
an
accountant
for
a
few
local
businesses
in

She
lives
in
a
large
,
comfortable
house
with
her
parents
:
Cosmo
(
Vincent
Gardenia
)
a
successful
plumber
,
Rose
(
Olympia
Dukakis
)
and
her
grandfather
,
Cosmo
's
father
(
Feodor
Chaliapin
,
Jr.
)
.

Her
boyfriend
,
Johnny
Cammareri
(
Danny
Aiello
)
,
proposes
to
her
over
dinner
in
a
neighborhood
Italian
restaurant
,
The
Grand
Ticino
,
before
leaving
for
Sicily
to
attend
to
his
dying
mother
.

She
agrees
on
the
condition
that
he
must
observe
the
formalities
of
kneeling
and
presenting
a
ring
because
she
considers
that
her
previous
marriage
was
cut
short
because
they
had
n't
observed
them
.

Johnny
asks
Loretta
to
invite
his
estranged
younger
brother
Ronny
(
Nicolas
Cage
)
to
the
wedding
.

Loretta
drives
Johnny
to
the
airport
,
then
stops
at
a
liquor
store
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
,
where
she
hears
the
proprietors
bickering
,
the
wife
accusing
the
husband
of
being
"
a
wolf
.
"

At
home
,
Cosmo
is
listening
to
Vicki
Carr
's
recording
of
"
It
Must
Be
Him
"
and
brooding
.

Loretta
pours
them
a
drink
and
shares
her
news
.

Cosmo
points
out
that
she
married
before
and
it
did
n't
work
out
.

Loretta
says
that
she
had
bad
luck
,
that
her
husband
was
hit
by
a
bus
.

She
believes
the
bad
luck
was
caused
by
her
not
having
had
a
real
wedding
.

Cosmo
had
not
approved
,
and
they
had
gotten
married
at
City
Hall
,
with
no
party
,
dress
,
no
cake
...
and
had
bad
luck
.

She
tells
him
she
has
to
have
a
"
real
"
wedding
this
time
.

They
wake
Rose
to
tell
her
the
news
.

She
asks
Loretta
if
she
loves
Johnny
.

Loretta
says
no
,
but
she
likes
him
.

Rose
says
that
is
good
,
"
When
you
love
them
they
drive
you
crazy
because
they
know
they
can
.
"

The
next
morning
as
Loretta
and
Rose
have
breakfast
,
Johnny
calls
from
Sicily
where
his
mother
is
dying
.

He
has
n't
told
her
about
his
engagement
yet
.

Loretta
urges
him
not
to
wait
until
she
is
dead
.

He
reminds
Loretta
of
her
promise
to
visit
Ronny
.

She
visits
the
bakery
that
Ronny
owns
.

He
explains
the
reason
for
the
bad
blood
:
Ronny
had
been
engaged
to
a
woman
,
and
during
that
time
Johnny
had
come
in
one
day
to
buy
bread
.

Ronny
talked
to
Johnny
as
he
sliced
the
bread
and
was
n't
paying
attention
,
and
he
lost
his
hand
in
the
slicer
.

His
fiancée
left
him
because
he
was
"
maimed
.
"

Ronny
blames
Johnny
for
the
accident
.

He
is
very
upset
.

Loretta
tells
him
she
has
not
come
to
upset
him
but
to
talk
.

They
go
to
his
apartment
above
the
bakery
and
Loretta
cooks
him
a
meal
and
they
drink
whiskey
and
talk
.

Loretta
tells
Ronny
that
he
is
a
"
wolf
"
who
allowed
himself
to
lose
his
hand
rather
than
be
caught
in
a
trap
.

Ronny
sweeps
Loretta
into
bed
,
and
they
make
love
.

That
night
an
amazing
full
moon
shines
over
the
couples
in
the
story
.

In
the
morning
,
Loretta
feels
ashamed
and
tells
Ronny
they
can
never
see
each
other
again
.

He
admits
he
's
fallen
in
love
but
agrees
to
not
see
her
again
--
if
she
will
go
to
the
opera
with
him
that
night
,
because
then
he
would
have
had
the
two
things
he
loves
most
,
the
opera
and
Loretta
.

She
agrees
to
meet
him
at
the
Met
.

That
day
Loretta
goes
to
a
beauty
salon
and
has
her
hair
colored
and
styled
,
her
eyebrows
plucked
--
a
complete
makeover
.

She
shops
for
a
beautiful
gown
and
shoes
.

She
stops
at
the
church
to
go
to
confession
,
telling
the
priest
that
she
has
slept
with
her
fiancé
's
brother
.

The
priest
urges
her
to
"
consider
her
life
.
"

She
sees
Rose
sitting
in
the
church
,
and
they
talk
.

Rose
tells
her
that
Cosmo
is
seeing
another
woman
.

Loretta
does
not
believe
her
.

Meanwhile
,
Cosmo
is
having
lunch
at
a
fancy
restaurant
with
his
mistress
Mona
(
Anita
Gillette
)
.

He
presents
her
with
a
gift
of
a
gold
bracelet
.

There
is
a
scene
that
evening
where
Loretta
plays
romantic
music
as
she
leisurely
dresses
for
the
opera
and
then
takes
a
cab
to
meet
Ronny
at
the
Met
.

He
is
wearing
a
tux
and
they
are
both
transformed
.

Loretta
is
deeply
moved
by
her
first
opera
,
Puccini
's
"
La
Bohème
"
.

That
night
Rose
dines
alone
at
The
Grand
Ticino
and
witnesses
a
dramatic
breakup
between
a
young
coed
and
a
college
professor
named
Perry
(
John
Mahoney
)
.

She
invites
Perry
to
dine
with
her
;
afterwards
he
walks
her
home
.

She
knows
her
husband
has
a
mistress
but
refuses
to
be
unfaithful
and
does
n't
take
Perry
's
suggestion
that
she
invite
him
in
"
because
I
know
who
I
am
.
"

As
Loretta
and
Ronny
leave
the
opera
,
she
sees
Cosmo
with
Mona
;
both
Loretta
and
Cosmo
are
shocked
to
see
the
other
with
someone
other
than
their
proper
partner
,
but
they
agree
to
ignore
the
fact
that
they
saw
each
other
.

Loretta
and
Ronny
stop
at
a
bar
for
a
drink
.

Loretta
is
upset
about
Cosmo
's
infidelity
and
feels
guilty
for
being
with
Ronny
.

She
explains
to
him
how
a
person
can
decide
to
do
things
differently
and
change
.

But
he
desperately
and
passionately
persuades
her
into
another
tryst
.

Meanwhile
,
Johnny
's
mother
has
made
a
miraculous
recovery
after
being
told
of
his
plans
to
marry
Loretta
,
and
he
has
returned
from
Sicily
unexpectedly
,
stopping
at
Loretta
's
house
on
his
way
back
from
the
airport
.

Rose
tells
him
that
Loretta
is
out
,
she
does
n't
know
where
.

While
they
have
the
opportunity
to
talk
,
Rose
asks
him
why
men
cheat
on
women
.

First
he
suggests
that
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
Adam
looking
for
his
missing
rib
,
but
Rose
lays
out
her
opinion
that
the
real
reason
is
fear
of
death
.

While
they
are
talking
,
Cosmo
comes
home
from
the
opera
.

Rose
says
to
him
,
"
I
just
want
you
to
know
no
matter
what
you
do
,
you
're
gon
na
die
just
like
everyone
else
.
"

Loretta
arrives
home
the
following
morning
,
having
spent
another
night
with
Ronny
.

Rose
is
alone
in
the
kitchen
and
tells
her
that
Johnny
has
come
back
from
Italy
and
will
be
there
soon
and
remarks
that
Loretta
has
a
love
bite
on
her
neck
.

As
they
wait
,
Ronny
arrives
.

Rose
lets
him
in
and
looks
at
his
neck
where
she
sees
a
love
bite
.

Rose
invites
Ronny
to
stay
for
breakfast
,
and
he
accepts
before
Loretta
can
stop
him
.

Cosmo
and
the
grandfather
come
down
for
breakfast
.

Cosmo
's
father
tells
him
that
he
must
pay
for
Loretta
's
wedding
this
time
,
and
sits
down
.

As
they
all
sit
around
the
table
,
Rose
asks
Cosmo
if
she
has
been
a
good
wife
,
and
when
he
tells
her
yes
she
tells
Cosmo
that
she
wants
him
to
stop
seeing
his
mistress
.

After
hesitating
,
he
agrees
to
,
but
complains
that
his
life
is
worth
nothing
.

Rose
counters
that
his
life
is
not
worth
nothing
,
that
she
loves
him
.

Rose
's
brother
Raymond
Cappomaggi
(
Louis
Guss
)
and
his
wife
Rita
(
Julie
Bovasso
)
stop
in
because
Loretta
,
who
does
their
books
,
forgot
to
make
the
bank
deposit
from
their
delicatessen
while
she
was
getting
her
makeover
,
and
they
are
worried
.

Everyone
is
introduced
to
Ronny
,
and
they
all
await
Johnny
's
arrival
.

When
Johnny
finally
comes
in
,
he
explains
to
Loretta
that
if
he
marries
her
,
his
mother
will
die
.

Loretta
,
forgetting
momentarily
that
this
is
good
news
,
throws
the
engagement
ring
at
him
.

Seizing
the
moment
,
Ronny
asks
Loretta
to
marry
him
;
he
borrows
Johnny
's
ring
,
and
Loretta
accepts
.

Rose
asks
Loretta
if
she
loves
him
,
and
when
Loretta
says
,
"
I
love
him
awful
,
"
Rose
comments
that
that
's
too
bad
.

The
family
shares
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
celebrate
and
the
grandfather
insists
that
Johnny
join
in
the
toast
because
he
will
now
be
one
of
the
family
as
well

The
grid
plan
,
grid
street
plan
or
gridiron
plan
is
a
type
of
city
plan
in
which
street
s
run
at
right
angle
s
to
each
other
,
forming
a
.

In
the
context
of
the
culture
of
Ancient
Rome
,
the
grid
plan
method
of
land
measurement
was
called
Centuriation
.

Ancient
grid
plans
The
grid
plan
dates
from
antiquity
and
originated
in
multiple
cultures
;
some
of
the
earliest
planned
cities
were
built
using
grid
plans
.

By
0000
BC
,
Mohenjo-daro
and
Harappa
,
major
cities
of
the
Indus
Valley
Civilization
(
now
in
Pakistan
)
,
were
built
with
blocks
divided
by
a
grid
of
straight
streets
,
running
north-south
and
east-west
.

Each
block
was
subdivided
by
small
lanes
.

The
cities
and
monasteries
of
Gandhara
(
e.g.
Sirkap
and
Taxila
)
,
dating
to
0st
millennium
BC
to
the
00th
century
AD
,
also
had
grid-based
designs
.

Islamabad
,
the
capital
of
Pakistan
since
0000
,
was
also
founded
on
the
grid-plan
of
the
nearby
ruined
city
of
Sirkap
.

A
workers
'
village
(
0000-0000
BC
)
at
Giza
,
Egypt
,
housed
a
rotating
labor
force
and
was
laid
out
in
blocks
of
long
galleries
separated
by
streets
in
a
formal
grid
.

Many
pyramid-cult
cities
used
a
common
orientation
:
a
north-south
axis
from
the
royal
palace
and
an
east-west
axis
from
the
temple
meeting
at
a
central
plaza
where
King
and
God
merged
and
crossed
.

Hammurabi
(
00th
century
BC
)
was
a
king
of
the
Babylonian
Empire
who
made
Babylon
one
of
the
greatest
cities
in
antiquity
.

He
rebuilt
Babylon
,
building
and
restoring
temples
,
city
walls
,
public
buildings
,
and
building
canals
for
irrigation
.

The
streets
of
Babylon
were
wide
and
straight
,
intersected
approximately
at
right
angles
,
and
were
paved
with
bricks
and
bitumen
.

The
tradition
of
grid
plans
is
continuous
in
China
from
the
00th
century
BC
onward
in
the
traditional
urban
planning
of
various
ancient
Chinese
states
.

Guidelines
put
into
written
form
in
the
Kaogongji
during
the
Spring
and
Autumn
Period
(
000-000
BC
)
stated
:
"
a
capital
city
should
be
square
on
plan
.

Three
gates
on
each
side
of
the
perimeter
lead
into
the
nine
main
streets
that
crisscross
the
city
and
define
its
grid-pattern
.

And
for
its
layout
the
city
should
have
the
Royal
Court
situated
in
the
south
,
the
Marketplace
in
the
north
,
the
Imperial
Ancestral
Temple
in
the
east
and
the
Altar
to
the
Gods
of
Land
and
Grain
in
the
west
.
"

Teotihuacan
,
near
modern-day
Mexico
City
,
is
the
largest
ancient
grid-plan
site
in
the
Americas
.

The
city
's
grid
covered
eight
square
miles
.

Roman
grid
Perhaps
the
most
well-known
grid
system
is
that
spread
through
the
colonies
of
the
Roman
Empire
.

The
archetypal
Roman
Grid
was
introduced
to
Italy
first
by
the
Greeks
,
with
such
information
transferred
by
way
of
trade
and
conquest
.

Although
the
grid
was
an
idea
present
in
Hellenic
societal
and
city
planning
,
it
was
not
pervasive
prior
to
the
0th
century
BC
.

However
,
it
slowly
gained
primacy
through
the
work
of
Hippodamus
of
Miletus
,
who
slowly
planned
and
replanned
many
Greek
cities
in
accordance
with
this
form
.

The
concept
of
a
grid
being
the
ideal
method
of
town-planning
became
widely
accepted
by
the
time
of
Alexander
the
Great
.

His
conquests
were
a
step
in
the
propagation
of
the
grid
plan
throughout
colonies
,
some
as
far-flung
as
Taxila
in
Pakistan
,
that
would
later
be
mirrored
by
the
expansion
of
the
Roman
Empire
.

The
Greek
grid
had
its
streets
aligned
roughly
in
relation
to
the
cardinal
points
and
generally
looked
to
take
advantage
of
visual
cues
based
on
the
hilly
landscape
typical
of
Greece
and
Asia
Minor
.

This
was
probably
best
exemplified
in
Priene
,
in
present-day
western
Turkey
,
where
the
orthogonal
city
grid
was
laid
out
according
with
respect
to
the
cardinal
points
,
on
sloping
terrain
that
struck
views
out
towards
a
river
and
the
aforementioned
city
of
Miletus
.

The
Etruscan
people
,
whose
territories
encompassed
what
would
eventually
become
Rome
(
Rix
cited
in
Woodward
0000
)
,
founded
what
is
now
the
Italian
city
of
Marzabotto
at
the
end
of
the
0th
century
BC
.

It
was
based
on
Greek
Ionic
ideas
,
and
it
was
here
that
the
main
east-west
and
north-south
axes
of
a
town
(
the
decumanus
maximus
and
cardo
maximus
respectively
)
could
first
be
seen
in
Italy
.

According
to
Stanislawski
,
there
is
little
evidence
that
the
Romans
adopted
the
Etruscan
model
at
Marzabatto
early
in
their
expansion
.

Instead
,
the
Roman
Grid
was
spread
around
the
Mediterranean
and
into
northern
Europe
later
on
during
"
the
late
Republic
and
the
early
Empire
"
period
that
saw
dissemination
of
the
grid
plan
throughout
this
area
.

The
military
expansion
of
this
period
facilitated
the
grid
form
becoming
the
standard
,
as
Romans
established
"
castra
"
firstly
as
military
centres
in
their
territories
,
some
of
which
would
develop
into
administrative
hubs
as
well
.

Despite
being
similar
in
form
to
the
Greek
version
of
a
grid
,
the
Roman
grid
was
ultimately
designed
on
the
basis
of
being
practical
.

Firstly
,
Roman
castra
were
often
sited
on
flat
land
,
especially
in
close
proximity
to
or
on
important
nodes
like
river
crossings
or
intersection
trade
routes
.

The
dimensions
of
the
castra
were
often
standard
as
well
,
with
each
of
its
four
walls
generally
having
a
length
of
0000
feet
.

Familiarity
was
the
aim
of
such
a
standard
form
of
town
planning
.

As
soldiers
could
be
stationed
anywhere
around
the
Empire
,
way-finding
would
be
a
non-issue
within
established
towns
as
there
would
be
no
variation
from
place
to
place
.

All
would
have
the
afore-mentioned
decumanus
maximus
and
cardo
maximus
at
its
heart
,
the
intersection
of
which
would
form
the
forum
.

Around
this
intersection
would
be
sited
important
public
buildings
in
much
the
same
way
a
Central
Business
District
sits
at
the
centre
of
modern
day
metropolitan
areas
.

Indeed
,
such
was
the
level
of
similarity
between
towns
that
Higgins
states
soldiers
"
would
be
housed
at
the
same
address
as
they
moved
from
castra
to
castra
"
.

Pompeii
has
been
cited
by
both
Higgins
and
Laurence
as
the
best
preserved
example
of
the
Roman
grid
.

Outside
of
the
castra
,
large
tracts
of
land
were
also
divided
in
accordance
with
the
grid
within
the
walls
.

These
were
typically
0000
feet
per
side
(
called
centuria
)
,
and
contained
000
parcels
of
land
(
each
called
heredium
)
.

The
decumanus
maximus
and
cardo
maximus
extended
from
the
town
gates
out
towards
neighbouring
settlements
.

These
were
lined
up
to
be
as
straight
as
possible
,
only
deviating
from
their
path
due
to
natural
obstacles
that
prevented
a
direct
route
.

While
the
imposition
of
only
one
town
form
regardless
of
region
could
be
seen
as
an
imposition
of
imperial
authority
,
there
is
no
doubting
the
practical
reasoning
behind
the
formation
of
the
Roman
grid
.

Under
Roman
guidance
,
the
grid
was
designed
for
efficiency
and
inter-changeability
,
both
facilitated
by
and
aiding
the
expansion
of
their
empire
.

Asia
from
the
first
millennium
AD
As
Japan
and
the
Korean
peninsula
became
politically
centralized
in
the
0th
century
AD
,
those
societies
adopted
Chinese
grid-planning
principles
in
numerous
locations
.

In
Korea
,
Gyeongju
,
the
capital
of
Unified
Silla
,
and
Sanggyong
,
the
capital
of
Balhae
,
adapted
the
Tang
Dynasty
Chinese
model
.

The
ancient
capitals
of
Japan
,
such
as
Fujiwara-Kyô
(
AD
000-000
)
,
Nara
(
Heijô-Kyô
,
AD
000-000
)
,
and
Kyoto
(
Heian-Kyô
,
AD
000-0000
)
also
adapted
from
Tang
's
capital
,
Chang
'
an
.

However
,
for
reasons
of
defense
,
the
planners
of
Tokyo
eschewed
the
grid
,
opting
instead
for
an
irregular
network
of
streets
surrounding
the
Edo
Castle
grounds
.

In
later
periods
,
some
parts
of
Tokyo
were
grid-planned
,
but
grid
plans
are
generally
rare
in
Japan
,
and
the
Japanese
addressing
system
is
accordingly
based
on
increasingly
fine
subdivisions
,
rather
than
a
grid
.

The
grid-planning
tradition
in
Asia
continued
through
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
,
with
Sapporo
,
Japan
(
est.
0000
)
following
a
grid
plan
under
American
influence
.

Europe
and
its
colonies
New
Europe
an
towns
were
planned
using
grids
beginning
in
the
00th
century
,
most
prodigiously
in
the
bastides
of
southern
France
that
were
built
during
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
.

Medieval
European
new
town
s
using
grid
plans
were
widespread
,
ranging
from
Wales
to
the
Florentine
region
.

Many
were
built
on
ancient
grids
originally
established
as
Roman
colonial
outposts
.

The
Roman
model
was
also
used
in
Spanish
settlements
during
the
Reconquista
of
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
.

It
was
subsequently
applied
in
the
new
cities
established
during
the
Spanish
colonization
of
the
Americas
,
after
the
founding
of
San
Cristóbal
de
La
Laguna
(
Canary
Islands
)
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
King
Phillip
II
of
Spain
compiled
the
Laws
of
the
Indies
to
guide
the
construction
and
administration
of
colonial
communities
.

The
Laws
specified
a
square
or
rectangular
central
plaza
with
eight
principal
streets
running
from
the
plaza
's
corners
.

Hundreds
of
grid-plan
communities
throughout
the
Americas
were
established
according
to
this
pattern
,
echoing
the
practices
of
earlier
Indian
civilizations
.

The
grid
plan
became
popular
with
the
start
of
the
Renaissance
in
Northern
Europe
.

In
0000
,
the
newly
founded
city
of
Mannheim
in
Germany
was
the
first
Renaissance
city
laid
out
on
the
grid
plan
.

Later
came
the
New
Town
in
Edinburgh
and
almost
the
entire
city
centre
of
Glasgow
,
and
many
planned
communities
and
cities
in
Australia
,
Canada
and
the
United
States
such
as
New
Haven
and
Adelaide
.

The
baroque
capital
city
of
Malta
,
Valletta
,
dating
back
to
the
00th
Century
,
was
built
following
a
rigid
grid
plan
of
uniformly
designed
houses
,
dotted
with
palaces
,
churches
and
squares
.

Early
United
States
Many
of
the
earliest
cities
in
the
United
States
,
such
as
Boston
,
did
not
start
with
a
grid
system
.

However
,
even
in
the
pre-revolutionary
days
some
cities
saw
the
benefits
of
such
a
layout
.

New
Haven
Colony
,
one
of
the
earliest
colonies
in
America
,
was
designed
with
a
tiny
0-square
grid
at
its
founding
in
0000
.

On
a
grander
scale
,
Philadelphia
was
designed
on
a
rectilinear
street
grid
in
0000
;
one
of
the
first
cities
in
North
America
to
use
a
grid
system
.

At
the
urging
of
city
founder
William
Penn
,
surveyor
Thomas
Holme
designed
a
system
of
wide
streets
intersecting
at
right
angles
between
the
Schuylkill
River
to
the
west
and
Delaware
River
to
the
east
,
including
five
squares
of
dedicated
parkland
.

Penn
advertised
this
orderly
design
as
a
safeguard
against
overcrowding
,
fire
,
and
disease
,
which
plagued
European
cities
.

Holme
drafted
an
ideal
version
of
the
grid
,
but
alleyways
sprouted
within
and
between
larger
blocks
as
the
city
took
shape
.

Arguably
the
most
famous
grid
plan
in
history
is
the
plan
for
New
York
City
formulated
in
the
Commissioners
'
Plan
of
0000
,
a
visionary
proposal
by
the
state
legislature
of
New
York
for
the
development
of
most
of
Manhattan
above
Houston
Street
.

Washington
,
D.C.
,
the
capital
of
the
United
States
,
was
planned
under
French-American
architect
Pierre
Charles
L'Enfant
.

Under
the
L'Enfant
plan
,
the
original
District
of
Columbia
was
developed
using
a
grid
plan
that
is
interrupted
by
diagonal
avenues
,
most
famously
Pennsylvania
Avenue
.

These
diagonals
are
often
connected
by
traffic
circles
,
such
as
Dupont
Circle
and
Washington
Circle
.

As
the
city
began
to
grow
in
size
,
the
plan
was
duplicated
to
cover
most
of
the
remainder
of
the
capital
.

Meanwhile
,
the
core
of
the
city
faced
disarray
and
the
McMillan
Plan
,
led
by
Senator
James
McMillan
was
founded
to
build
a
National
Mall
and
parks
system
,
that
is
still
today
a
jewel
of
the
city
.

Often
,
some
of
the
streets
in
a
grid
are
numbered
(
First
,
Second
,
etc.
)
,
lettered
,
or
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
.

(
Washington
,
DC
has
examples
of
all
three
.
)

An
exception
to
the
typical
,
uniform
grid
is
the
plan
of
Savannah
,
Georgia
(
0000
)
.

It
is
a
composite
,
cellular
city
block
consisting
of
four
large
corner
blocks
,
four
small
blocks
in
between
and
a
public
square
in
the
centre
.

Its
cellular
structure
includes
all
the
primary
land
uses
of
a
neighborhood
and
has
for
that
reason
been
called
fractal
.

Its
street
configuration
presages
modern
traffic
calming
techniques
applied
to
uniform
grids
where
certain
selected
streets
become
discontinuous
or
narrow
thus
discouraging
through
traffic
.

In
the
westward
development
of
the
United
States
,
the
use
of
the
grid
plan
was
nearly
universal
in
the
construction
of
new
communities
,
such
as
in
Salt
Lake
City
(
0000
)
,
Dodge
City
(
0000
)
and
Oklahoma
City
(
0000
)
.

In
these
western
cities
the
streets
were
numbered
even
more
carefully
than
in
the
east
to
suggest
future
prosperity
and
metropolitan
status
.

One
of
the
main
advantages
of
the
adoption
of
the
grid
plan
was
that
it
allowed
the
rapid
subdivision
and
auction
of
a
large
parcel
of
land
.

For
example
,
when
the
legislature
of
the
Republic
of
Texas
decided
in
0000
to
move
the
capital
to
the
new
site
along
the
Colorado
River
,
the
functioning
of
the
government
required
the
rapid
population
of
the
town
,
which
was
named
Austin
.

Charged
with
the
task
,
Edwin
Waller
designed
a
fourteen-block
grid
that
fronted
the
river
on
000
acres
(
exactly
0
square
mile
;
about
0.0
km
²
)
.

After
surveying
the
land
,
Waller
organized
the
sale
of
000
lots
nearly
immediately
,
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
entire
Texas
government
had
arrived
by
oxcart
at
the
new
site
.

Apart
from
the
speed
of
surveying
advantage
,
the
rationale
at
the
time
of
the
grid
's
adoption
in
this
and
other
cities
remains
obscure
.

Late
00th
century
to
the
present
Ildefons
Cerdà
defined
a
concept
of
urban
planning
,
based
on
the
grid
,
that
he
applied
to
the
Barcelona
Eixample
.

The
Eixample
grid
introduced
innovative
design
elements
that
made
it
exceptional
at
the
time
and
even
unique
among
subsequent
grid
plans
:
These
innovations
he
based
on
functional
grounds
:
the
block
size
,
to
enable
the
creation
of
a
quiet
interior
open
space
(
00
m
by
00
m
)
and
allow
ample
sunlight
and
ventilation
to
its
perimeter
buildings
;
the
rectilinear
geometry
,
the
wide
streets
and
boulevards
to
sustain
high
mobility
and
the
truncated
corners
to
facilitate
turning
of
carts
and
coaches
and
particularly
vehicles
on
fixed
rails
.

In
maps
of
larger
American
cities
,
mostly
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
,
it
can
be
noted
that
the
downtown
areas
are
almost
always
grids
.

These
areas
represent
the
original
land
dimensions
of
the
founded
city
,
generally
one
square
mile
.

Some
cities
expanded
the
grid
further
out
from
the
centre
but
maps
also
show
that
,
in
general
,
as
the
distance
from
the
centre
increases
a
variety
of
patterns
emerge
in
no
particular
discernible
order
.

In
juxtaposition
to
the
grid
they
appear
random
.

These
new
patterns
have
been
systematically
classified
and
their
design
characteristics
measured
In
the
United
States
,
the
grid
system
was
widely
used
in
most
major
cities
and
their
suburb
s
until
the
0000s
.

However
,
during
the
0000s
,
the
rapid
adoption
of
the
automobile
caused
a
panic
among
urban
planners
,
who
,
based
on
observation
,
claimed
that
speeding
cars
would
eventually
kill
tens
of
thousands
of
small
children
per
year
.

Apparently
,
at
this
early
stage
of
the
car
's
entry
into
the
grid
,
the
streets
of
major
cities
worldwide
were
the
scene
of
virtual
"
slaughter
"
as
the
fatality
rate
per
000,000
pop
was
more
than
double
the
current
.

In
0000
,
after
several
decades
of
road
safety
improvements
and
a
constant
decline
in
fatalities
,
an
estimated
00,000
people
died
in
motor
vehicle
traffic
crashes
and
,
according
to
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
,
"
Motor
vehicle
crashes
are
the
leading
cause
of
death
for
children
from
0
to
00
years
old
.
"
.

Planners
,
therefore
,
called
for
an
inwardly
focused
"
superblock
"
arrangement
that
minimized
through
automobile
traffic
and
discouraged
it
from
traveling
on
anything
but
arterial
road
s
;
traffic
generators
,
such
as
apartment
complexes
and
shops
,
would
be
restricted
to
the
edges
of
the
superblock
,
along
the
arterial
.

This
paradigm
prevailed
between
approximately
0000
and
0000
,
especially
in
Los
Angeles
,
where
notable
examples
include
Leimert
Park
(
an
early
example
)
and
Panorama
City
(
a
late-period
one
)
.

A
prominent
00th
century
urbanist
,
Lewis
Mumford
,
severely
criticized
some
of
the
grid
's
characteristics
:
"
With
a
T-square
and
a
triangle
,
finally
,
the
municipal
engineer
could
,
without
the
slightest
training
as
either
an
architect
or
a
sociologist
,
'
plan
'
a
metropolis
,
with
its
standard
lots
,
its
standard
blocks
,
its
standard
street
widths
,
in
short
,
with
its
standardized
comparable
,
and
replaceable
parts
.

The
new
gridiron
plans
were
spectacular
in
their
inefficiency
and
waste
.

By
usually
failing
to
discriminate
sufficiently
between
main
arteries
and
residential
streets
,
the
first
were
not
made
wide
enough
while
the
second
were
usually
too
wide
for
purely
neighborhood
functions
.
.
.
as
for
its
contribution
to
the
permanent
social
functions
of
the
city
,
the
anonymous
gridiron
plan
proved
empty
.
"

In
the
0000s
,
traffic
engineers
and
urban
planners
abandoned
the
grid
virtually
wholesale
in
favor
of
a
"
street
hierarchy
"
.

This
is
a
thoroughly
"
asymmetric
"
street
arrangement
in
which
a
residential
subdivision
—
often
surrounded
by
a
noise
wall
or
a
security
gate
—
is
completely
separated
from
the
road
network
except
for
one
or
two
connections
to
arterial
roads
.

In
a
way
,
this
is
a
return
to
medieval
styles
:
as
noted
in
Spiro
Kostof
's
seminal
history
of
urban
design
,
The
City
Shaped
,
there
is
a
strong
resemblance
between
the
street
arrangements
of
modern
American
suburbs
and
those
of
medieval
Arab
and
Moorish
cities
.

In
each
case
,
the
community
unit
at
hand
—
the
clan
or
extended
family
in
the
Muslim
world
,
the
economically
homogeneous
subdivision
in
modern
suburbia
—
isolates
itself
from
the
larger
urban
scene
by
using
dead
ends
and
culs-de-sac
.

Milton
Keynes
One
very
famous
use
of
the
grid
system
was
in
the
British
new
town
of
Milton
Keynes
.

In
this
planned
city
,
which
began
construction
in
0000
,
a
system
of
ten
"
horizontal
"
(
roughly
east-west
)
and
eleven
"
vertical
"
(
roughly
north-south
)
roads
was
used
with
roundabout
s
at
each
intersection
.

The
horizontal
roads
were
all
given
names
ending
in
'
way
'
and
H
numbers
(
for
'
horizontal
'
,
e.g.
H0
Monks
Way
)
.

The
vertical
roads
were
given
names
ending
in
'
street
'
and
V
numbers
(
for
'
vertical
'
,
e.g.
V0
Grafton
Street
)
.

Each
grid
road
was
spaced
roughly
one
kilometre
along
from
the
next
,
forming
squares
of
approximately
one
square
kilometre
.

Each
square
and
each
roundabout
was
given
its
own
name
.

The
system
provided
very
easy
transport
within
the
city
,
although
it
confused
visitors
who
were
unfamiliar
with
the
system
.

The
grid
squares
thus
formed
are
far
larger
than
the
city
blocks
described
earlier
,
and
the
road
layouts
within
the
grid
squares
are
generally
'
organic
'
in
form
–
matching
the
street
hierarchy
model
described
above
.

Benefits
and
criticisms
Financial
cost
The
infrastructure
cost
for
regular
grid
patterns
is
generally
higher
than
for
patterns
with
discontinuous
streets
.

Costs
for
streets
depend
largely
on
four
variables
:
street
width
,
street
length
,
block
width
and
pavement
width
.

Street
width
,
or
right
of
way
(
ROW
)
,
influences
the
amount
of
land
that
is
devoted
to
streets
,
which
becomes
unavailable
for
development
and
therefore
represents
an
opportunity
cost
.

The
wider
the
street
the
higher
the
opportunity
cost
.

Street
width
is
determined
by
circulation
and
aesthetic
considerations
and
is
not
dependent
on
the
pattern
configuration
.

Any
configuration
can
have
wide
or
narrow
streets
.

Street
length
influences
proportionately
the
amount
of
street
components
that
have
to
be
constructed
such
as
pavement
,
curbs
and
sidewalks
,
storm
sewers
and
drains
,
light
poles
,
and
trees
.

The
street
length
of
a
given
area
of
development
depends
on
the
frequency
at
which
streets
occur
which
in
turn
depends
on
the
length
and
width
of
a
block
.

The
higher
the
frequency
of
streets
the
longer
is
their
total
length
.

The
smaller
the
block
dimensions
the
higher
the
frequency
of
the
streets
.

As
the
frequency
of
street
increases
so
does
the
number
of
intersections
.

Intersections
normally
cost
more
than
straight
street
length
because
they
are
labour-intensive
and
require
street
and
traffic
signage
.

Pavement
width
influences
the
cost
by
affecting
the
amount
of
materials
and
labour
required
to
provide
a
finished
road
surface
.

Pavement
width
is
generally
based
on
traffic
engineering
considerations
and
is
not
dependent
on
pattern
configuration
.

As
with
the
street
width
,
any
pattern
can
have
wide
or
narrow
pavements
.

Of
all
three
factors
that
affect
cost
,
street
width
,
street
length
and
pavement
width
,
only
street
length
is
pattern
dependent
.

An
objective
cost
comparison
would
,
therefore
,
rely
on
this
variable
with
the
full
understanding
that
the
other
variables
,
though
optional
,
can
play
a
role
.

Traditional
orthogonal
grid
patterns
generally
have
greater
street
frequencies
than
discontinuous
patterns
.

For
example
,
Portland
's
block
is
000
feet
×
000
feet
while
Miletus
'
is
half
that
size
and
Timgad
's
half
again
(
see
diagram
)
.

Houston
,
Sacramento
and
Barcelona
are
progressively
bigger
reaching
up
to
four
times
the
area
of
Portland
's
block
.

New
York
's
0000
plan
(
see
above
)
has
blocks
of
000
ft.
in
width
and
variable
lengths
ranging
from
about
000
to
000
feet
.

The
corresponding
frequency
of
streets
for
each
of
these
block
sizes
affects
the
street
length
.

A
simple
example
of
a
grid
street
pattern
(
see
diagram
)
illustrates
the
progressive
reduction
in
total
street
length
(
the
sum
of
all
individual
street
lengths
)
and
the
corresponding
increase
in
block
length
.

For
a
corresponding
reduction
of
one
,
two
,
three
and
four
streets
within
this
parcel
,
the
street
length
is
reduced
from
an
original
total
of
00,000
to
0,000
linear
feet
,
a
00
%
reduction
.

Simultaneously
,
block
lengths
increase
from
000
×
000
feet
to
0000
×
000
feet
.

When
all
five
blocks
have
reached
the
ultimate
size
of
0000
feet
,
four
street
lengths
out
of
total
eight
have
been
eliminated
.

Block
lengths
of
0000
feet
or
larger
rarely
appear
in
grid
plans
and
are
not
recommended
as
they
hinder
pedestrian
movement
(
Pedestrianism
,
below
)
.

From
the
pedestrian
perspective
,
the
smaller
the
block
is
,
the
easier
the
navigation
and
the
more
direct
the
route
.

Consequently
,
the
finer
grids
are
preferred
.

Patterns
that
incorporate
discontinuous
street
types
such
as
crescents
and
culs-de-sac
have
not
,
in
general
,
regarded
pedestrian
movement
as
a
priority
and
,
consequently
,
have
produced
blocks
that
are
usually
in
the
0000-foot
range
and
often
exceed
it
.

As
a
result
,
street
frequency
drops
and
so
does
the
total
street
length
and
,
therefore
,
the
cost
.

In
general
,
it
is
not
the
street
pattern
per
se
that
affects
costs
but
the
frequency
of
streets
that
it
either
necessitates
or
purposely
incorporates
.

An
inherent
advantage
of
the
orthogonal
geometry
of
a
proper
grid
is
its
tendency
to
yield
regular
lots
in
well-packed
sequences
.

This
maximizes
the
use
of
the
land
of
the
block
;
it
does
not
,
however
,
affect
street
frequency
.

Any
frequency
of
orthogonal
streets
produces
the
same
packing
effect
.

Orthogonal
geometry
also
minimizes
disputes
over
lot
boundaries
and
maximizes
the
number
of
lots
that
could
front
a
given
street
.

John
Randal
said
Manhattan
's
grid
plan
facilitated
"
buying
,
selling
and
improving
real
estate
"
.

Another
important
aspect
of
street
grids
and
the
use
of
rectilinear
blocks
is
that
traffic
flows
of
either
pedestrians
,
cars
,
or
both
,
only
cross
at
right
angles
.

This
is
an
important
traffic
safety
feature
,
since
no
one
entering
the
intersection
needs
to
look
over
their
shoulder
to
see
oncoming
traffic
.

Any
time
traffic
flows
meet
at
an
acute
angle
,
someone
can
not
see
traffic
approaching
them
.

The
grid
is
thus
a
geometric
response
to
our
human
physiology
.

It
is
very
likely
the
original
purpose
of
grid
layouts
from
the
Athenian
Agora
.

Before
the
grid
organization
,
markets
were
laid
out
randomly
in
a
field
with
traffic
approaches
at
odd
angles
.

This
caused
carts
and
wagons
to
turn
over
due
to
frequent
collisions
.

Laying
out
the
market
stalls
into
regularized
rows
at
right
angles
solved
this
problem
and
was
later
built
into
the
Athenian
Agora
and
copied
ever
since
.

Ecological
features
,
rain
water
absorption
and
pollutant
generation
Typical
uniform
grids
are
unresponsive
to
topography
.

Priene
's
plan
,
for
example
,
is
set
on
a
hill
side
and
most
of
its
north-south
streets
are
stepped
,
a
feature
that
would
have
made
them
inaccessible
to
carts
,
chariots
and
loaded
animals
.

Many
modern
cities
follow
Priene
's
example
,
e.g.
San
Francisco
,
Vancouver
,
and
Saint
John
,
New
Brunswick
.

In
a
modern
context
,
steep
grades
limit
accessibility
by
car
,
and
more
so
by
bicycle
,
on
foot
,
or
wheelchair
,
particularly
in
cold
climates
.

The
same
inflexibility
of
the
grid
leads
to
disregarding
environmentally
sensitive
areas
such
as
small
streams
and
creeks
or
mature
woodlots
in
preference
for
the
application
of
the
immutable
geometry
.

It
is
said
of
the
NY
grid
plan
that
it
flattened
all
obstacles
in
its
way
.

By
contrast
,
recent
discontinuous
street
patterns
follow
the
configuration
of
natural
features
without
disrupting
them
.

The
grid
represents
a
rationalist
,
reductionist
solution
to
a
multifaceted
issue
.

The
grid
's
inherent
high
street
and
intersection
frequencies
produce
large
areas
of
impermeable
surfaces
in
the
street
pavement
and
the
sidewalks
.

In
comparison
to
recent
networks
with
discontinuous
street
types
,
grids
can
be
up
to
00
%
higher
in
impermeable
surfaces
attributable
to
roads
.

The
emerging
environmental
priority
of
retaining
as
much
as
00
%
of
rain
water
on
site
becomes
problematic
with
high
percentages
of
impermeable
surfaces
.

And
since
roads
constitute
the
largest
share
of
the
total
impermeable
surfaces
of
a
development
,
the
difficulty
is
compounded
by
the
grid
type
of
layout
.

For
these
reasons
modern
planners
have
attempted
to
modify
the
rigid
,
uniform
,
classic
grid
.

Some
cities
,
notably
Seattle
,
have
devised
means
to
improve
a
street
's
retention
capacity
.

However
,
frequent
intersections
as
they
occur
in
a
regular
grid
would
pose
an
obstacle
to
their
effective
application
.

A
street
network
pattern
can
affect
the
production
of
pollutants
by
the
amount
of
car
travel
that
it
necessitates
and
the
speed
at
which
cars
can
travel
.

The
grid
plan
with
its
frequent
intersections
may
displace
a
portion
of
the
local
car
trips
with
walking
or
biking
due
to
the
directness
of
route
that
it
offers
to
pedestrians
.

But
it
also
makes
the
same
routes
more
direct
for
cars
,
which
could
be
an
enticement
for
driving
.

The
potential
car
trip
displacement
would
result
in
a
reduction
of
pollutant
emissions
.

The
advantage
of
the
intersection
density
for
pedestrians
,
however
,
can
have
a
contrary
effect
for
cars
due
to
its
potential
for
reducing
speeds
.

Low
speeds
below
00
mph
have
a
significantly
higher
coefficient
of
pollutant
production
than
above
00
,
though
the
coefficient
after
levelling
off
tends
to
increase
gradually
after
00
mph
.

This
effect
is
accentuated
with
high
traffic
density
in
areas
with
commercial
uses
where
speeds
come
to
a
crawl
.

Since
the
grid
plan
is
non-hierarchical
and
intersections
are
frequent
,
all
streets
can
be
subject
to
this
potential
reduction
of
average
speeds
,
leading
to
a
high
production
of
pollutants
.

Greenhouse
and
noxious
gases
can
be
detrimental
to
the
environment
and
to
resident
health
.

Social
environment
and
security
In
his
seminal
study
(
0000
)
on
livable
streets
that
was
conducted
in
neighbourhoods
with
a
grid
,
Donald
Appleyard
showed
that
social
networking
and
street
playing
degraded
as
traffic
increased
on
a
street
.

His
research
provided
the
groundwork
for
traffic
calming
and
for
several
initiatives
such
as
living
street
s
and
Home
Zone
s
,
all
of
which
are
aimed
at
improving
a
street
's
social
milieu
.

The
amount
of
traffic
on
a
street
depends
on
variables
such
as
the
population
density
of
the
neighbourhood
,
car
ownership
and
its
proximity
to
commercial
,
institutional
or
recreational
edifices
.

Most
importantly
,
however
,
it
depends
on
whether
a
street
is
or
could
become
a
through
road
to
a
destination
.

As
a
through
road
,
it
could
sustain
unpredictable
levels
of
traffic
that
may
fluctuate
during
the
day
and
increase
over
time
.

A
key
characteristic
of
the
grid
pattern
is
that
any
and
all
streets
are
equally
accessible
to
traffic
(
non-hierarchical
)
and
could
be
chosen
at
will
as
alternative
routes
to
a
destination
.

Cut-through
driving
,
or
shortcutting
,
has
been
resisted
by
residents
.

Cities
responded
by
making
modifications
to
prevent
it
.

Current
recommended
design
practice
suggests
the
use
of
0-way
intersections
to
alleviate
it
.

The
geometry
of
the
normal
,
open
grid
is
evidently
unsuitable
for
protecting
or
enhancing
the
social
environment
of
a
street
from
the
negative
influence
of
traffic
.

Similarly
,
a
0000
ground-breaking
study
by
Oscar
Newman
on
a
Defensible
Space
Theory
described
ways
to
improve
the
social
environment
and
security
of
neighbourhoods
and
streets
.

In
a
practical
application
of
his
theory
at
Five
Oaks
,
the
neighbourhood
's
grid
pattern
was
modified
to
prevent
through
traffic
and
create
identifiable
smaller
enclaves
while
maintaining
complete
pedestrian
freedom
of
movement
.

The
positive
outcome
of
these
changes
reinforces
Appleyard
's
findings
and
the
need
to
reduce
or
prevent
through
traffic
on
neighbourhood
streets
;
a
need
that
can
not
be
met
with
a
typical
,
uniform
,
open
grid
.

The
question
of
neighbourhood
security
has
been
a
constant
focus
of
research
since
Oscar
Newman
's
work
.

New
research
has
expanded
the
discussion
on
this
disputed
issue
.

A
recent
study
did
extensive
spatial
analysis
and
correlated
several
building
,
site
plan
and
social
factors
with
crime
frequencies
and
identified
subtle
nuances
to
the
contrasting
positions
.

The
study
looked
at
,
among
others
,
dwelling
types
,
unit
density
(
site
density
)
movement
on
the
street
,
culs
–
de-sac
or
grids
and
the
permeability
of
a
residential
area
.

Among
its
conclusions
are
,
respectively
,
that
flats
are
always
safer
than
houses
and
the
wealth
of
inhabitants
matters
,
density
is
generally
beneficial
but
more
so
at
ground
level
,
local
movement
is
beneficial
,
but
not
larger
scale
movement
,
relative
affluence
and
the
number
of
neighbours
have
a
greater
effect
than
either
being
on
a
cul-de-sac
or
being
on
a
through
street
.

It
also
re-established
that
simple
,
linear
culs-de-sac
with
good
numbers
of
dwellings
that
are
joined
to
through
streets
tend
to
be
safe
.

As
for
permeability
,
it
suggests
that
residential
areas
should
be
permeable
enough
to
allow
movement
in
all
directions
but
no
more
.

The
overprovision
of
poorly
used
permeability
is
a
crime
hazard
.

The
open
,
uniform
grid
could
be
seen
as
an
example
of
undifferentiated
permeability
.

A
recent
study
in
California
examined
the
amount
of
child
play
that
occurred
on
the
streets
of
neighbourhoods
with
different
characteristics
;
grid
pattern
and
culs-de-sac
.

The
findings
indicate
that
the
open
grid
streets
showed
substantially
lower
play
activity
than
the
cul-de-sac
street
type
.

Culs-de-sac
reduce
perceived
danger
from
traffic
thereby
encouraging
more
outdoor
play
.

It
pointed
the
way
toward
the
development
of
hybrid
street
network
patterns
that
improve
pedestrian
movement
but
restrict
cut-through
driving
.

Similar
studies
in
Europe
and
most
recently
in
Australia
found
that
children
's
outdoor
play
is
significantly
reduced
on
through
roads
where
traffic
is
,
or
perceived
by
parents
to
be
,
a
risk
.

Traditional
street
functions
such
as
kids
'
play
,
strolling
and
socializing
are
incompatible
with
traffic
flow
,
which
the
open
,
uniform
grid
geometry
encourages
.

For
these
reasons
,
cities
such
as
Berkeley
,
California
,
and
Vancouver
,
British
Columbia
,
among
many
others
,
transformed
existing
residential
streets
part
of
a
grid
plan
into
permeable
,
linked
culs-de-sac
.

This
transformation
retains
the
permeability
and
connectivity
of
the
grid
for
the
active
modes
of
transport
but
filters
and
restricts
car
traffic
on
the
cul-de-sac
street
to
residents
only
.

Pedestrian
and
bicycle
movement
Two
inherent
characteristics
of
the
grid
plan
,
frequent
intersections
and
orthogonal
geometry
,
assist
pedestrian
movement
.

The
geometry
helps
with
orientation
and
wayfinding
and
its
frequent
intersections
with
the
choice
and
directness
of
route
to
desired
destinations
.

Street
networks
of
old
cities
that
grew
organically
,
though
admired
for
being
picturesque
,
can
be
confusing
for
visitors
but
rarely
for
the
original
inhabitants
(
see
plan
)
.

Similarly
confusing
to
visitors
are
the
plans
of
modern
subdivisions
with
discontinuous
and
curvilinear
streets
.

Change
of
street
orientation
,
particularly
when
gradual
or
arbitrary
,
can
not
be
"
mapped
"
in
the
mind
.

Impasses
,
crescents
or
cul-de-sacs
frustrate
the
traveler
especially
when
they
are
long
,
forcing
an
arduous
retracing
of
steps
.

Frequency
of
intersections
,
however
,
becomes
also
a
disadvantage
for
pedestrians
and
bicycles
.

It
disrupts
the
relaxed
canter
of
walking
and
forces
pedestrians
repeatedly
onto
the
road
,
a
hostile
,
anxiety-generating
territory
.

People
with
physical
limitations
or
frailties
,
children
and
seniors
for
example
,
can
find
such
walk
challenging
.

For
bicycles
this
disadvantage
is
accentuated
as
their
normal
speed
is
at
least
double
that
of
pedestrians
.

Frequent
stops
negate
the
speed
advantage
and
the
physical
benefit
of
bicycling
and
add
to
frustration
.

Intersections
are
not
only
unpleasant
but
also
dangerous
.

Most
traffic
collisions
and
injuries
occur
at
intersections
and
the
majority
of
the
injuries
to
pedestrians
crossing
with
the
right
of
way
.

A
dilemma
arises
from
trying
to
meet
important
planning
objectives
when
using
the
grid
:
pedestrianism
,
cost
efficiency
and
environmental
responsiveness
.

To
serve
pedestrians
well
,
a
rectangular
configuration
and
high
frequency
of
streets
and
intersections
is
the
preferred
route
,
which
the
orthogonal
grid
geometry
provides
.

To
reduce
development
costs
and
environmental
impact
,
lower
frequency
of
streets
is
the
logical
path
.

Since
these
two
design
objectives
are
contradictory
a
balance
needs
to
be
struck
.

Such
balance
has
been
achieved
in
leading
modern
projects
such
as
Vauban
,
Freiburg
and
Village
Homes
,
Davis
.

Both
score
high
in
pedestrian
and
bike
mode
share
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
reducing
negative
development
externalities
.

Their
layout
configurations
represent
a
fusion
of
the
classic
grid
plan
with
recent
street
network
patterns
.

Examining
the
issue
of
walkability
,
a
recent
comparison
of
seven
neighbourhood
layouts
found
a
00
and
00
percent
increase
in
walking
with
respect
to
a
grid
plan
and
conventional
suburban
layout
in
a
Fused
Grid
layout
,
which
has
greater
permeability
for
pedestrians
than
for
cars
due
to
its
inclusion
of
dedicated
pedestrian
paths
.

It
also
showed
a
0
to
00
percent
range
of
reduction
in
driving
with
respect
to
the
remainder
six
neighbourhood
layouts
in
the
set
,
an
environmental
benefit
.

Safety
Perceived
and
actual
safety
play
a
role
in
the
use
of
the
street
.

Perceived
safety
,
though
perhaps
an
inaccurate
reflection
of
the
number
of
injuries
or
fatalities
,
influences
parents
'
decision
to
allow
their
children
to
play
,
walk
or
bike
on
the
street
.

Actual
levels
of
safety
as
measured
by
the
total
number
of
collisions
and
the
number
and
severity
of
injuries
are
a
matter
of
public
concern
.

Both
should
inform
the
layout
,
if
the
street
network
is
to
achieve
its
optimum
use
.

Recent
studies
have
found
higher
traffic
fatality
rates
in
outlying
suburban
areas
than
in
central
cities
and
inner
suburbs
with
smaller
blocks
and
more-connected
street
patterns
.

While
some
of
this
disparity
is
the
result
of
distance
from
emergency
medical
facilities
(
hospitals
are
usually
built
in
a
fairly
late
stage
of
the
development
of
a
suburban
area
)
,
it
is
clear
that
the
lower
speeds
encouraged
by
the
frequency
of
intersections
decrease
the
severity
of
accidents
occurring
on
streets
within
a
grid
plan
.

An
earlier
study
found
significant
differences
in
recorded
accidents
between
residential
neighbourhoods
that
were
laid
out
on
a
grid
and
those
that
included
culs-de-sac
and
crescents
.

The
frequency
of
accidents
was
significantly
higher
in
the
grid
neighbourhoods
.

Two
newer
studies
examined
the
frequency
of
collisions
in
two
regional
districts
using
the
latest
analytical
tools
.

They
investigated
the
potential
correlation
between
street
network
patterns
and
frequency
of
collisions
.

In
one
study
,
cul-de-sac
networks
appeared
to
be
much
safer
than
grid
networks
,
by
nearly
three
to
one
.

A
second
study
found
the
grid
plan
to
be
the
least
safe
by
a
significant
margin
with
respect
to
all
other
street
patterns
.

A
0000
study
suggests
that
land
use
patterns
play
a
significant
role
in
traffic
safety
and
should
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
network
pattern
.

While
all
intersection
types
in
general
reduce
the
incidence
of
fatal
crashes
,
four-way
intersections
,
which
occur
regularly
in
a
grid
,
increase
total
and
injurious
crashes
significantly
.

The
study
recommends
hybrid
street
networks
with
dense
concentrations
of
T-intersections
and
concludes
that
a
return
to
the
00th
century
gridiron
is
undesirable
.

Stringent
adherence
to
the
grid
plan
can
cause
steep
inclines
since
the
topology
of
the
land
is
not
taken
into
account
.

This
may
be
unsafe
for
drivers
,
pedestrians
and
bicycles
since
it
is
more
difficult
to
control
speed
and
braking
,
particularly
in
winter
conditions
.

Reconstruction
and
development
One
of
the
greatest
difficulties
with
grid
plans
is
their
lack
of
specialisation
,
most
of
the
important
amenities
being
concentrated
along
the
city
's
main
arteries
.

Often
grid
plans
are
found
in
linear
settlements
,
with
a
main
street
connecting
between
the
perpendicular
roads
.

However
,
this
can
be
mitigated
by
allowing
mixed
use
development
so
that
destinations
become
closer
to
home
.

Many
cities
,
especially
in
Latin
America
,
still
successfully
retain
their
grid
plans
.

Recently
,
planners
in
the
United
States
and
Canada
have
revisited
the
idea
of
reintroducing
grid
patterns
to
many
cities
and
towns
.

Addressing
House
numbering
can
be
tailored
to
the
grid
.

Controversy
Elmwood
Place
has
installed
two
unmanned
speed
cameras
in
the
village
,
automatically
ticketing
speeding
vehicles
that
pass
through
the
village
.

It
has
been
described
as
a
"
money
grab
"
and
"
shake
down
"
by
residents
,
politicians
and
lawyers
.

In
the
first
week
the
machines
issued
over
0,000
tickets
,
netting
the
village
over
$
000,000
.

In
the
first
month
the
units
ticketed
0,000
drivers
at
$
000.00
each
.

As
of
December
00
the
tiny
village
has
issued
over
0.0
million
in
tickets
,
netting
them
over
$
000,000
in
pure
cash
.

Some
drivers
were
also
upset
that
they
could
n't
pay
the
ticket
at
the
town
hall
,
like
other
tickets
.

You
have
to
send
it
to
Cleveland
;
or
pay
by
either
phone/online
,
of
which
both
carry
an
additional
$
0.00
fee
.

It
has
been
recommended
by
Elmwood
Place
councilman
Jerald
Robertson
that
the
mayor
resign
and
all
drivers
avoid
the
village
and
its
businesses
until
the
cameras
are
removed
.

On

,
Hamilton
County
Common
Pleas
Judge
Robert
Ruehlman
ordered
a
halt
to
the
use
of

,
calling
them
"
a

"
that
,
when
combined
with
the
city

tactics

violated

Kentucky
metropolitan

History
Harrison
was
named
after
the

US
President
,
William
Henry
Harrison
.

It

incorporated
in
0000
,
and
became
a
city
in
0000
.

Harrison
Township
was
established
in
0000
,
formerly
part
of
Crosby
Township
.

Among
the
historic
site
s
in
the
city
's
vicinity
is
the
Eighteen
Mile
House
,
which
was
built
during
the
earliest
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
.

Harrison
was
the
home
of
Ohio
's
fifth
governor
Othneil
Looker
.

It
was
one
of
the
few
stops
in
Ohio
on
the
Whitewater
Canal
,
built
between
0000
and
0000
,

.

On

ers
,
a

force
,
invaded

the
bridge
over

dogs
.

The
track
had
originally
opened

,
when
parimutuel
betting
was
illegal
in
Indiana
.

However
,
during

Depression
,
heads
were
turned
as
the
track
attracted
revenue
to
the
area
and
was
one
of
the
highest
paying
local
jobs
at
$
00
a
week
.

History
The
birth
of
the
town
,
and
its
name
,
are
related
to
the
first
set
of
lock
gates
that
one
would
have
encountered
heading
north
on
the
Miami
and
Erie
Canal
.

The
canal
served
as
a
major
transportation
route
linking
commerce
from
as
far
as
New
Orleans
to
New
York
City
.

Many
people
and
industry
were
attracted
to
the
western
Ohio
area
by
the
idea
of
connecting
Lake
Erie
to
the
Ohio
River
.

Lockland
provided
an
abundance
of
water
power
,
having
a
difference
in
water
tables
.

This
allowed
for
a
water
mill
which
ground
flour
for
local
farmers
.

A
large
reservoir
pond
allowed
boats
to
dock
for
repairs
or
layover
.

Even
today
a
section
of
Lockland
is
still
referred
to
as
"
Bud-Town
"
which
was
the
bedding
and
entertainment
area
of
the
day
.

Despite
the
locomotive
boom
the
canal
remained
semi-operational
until
0000
.

The
canal
sat
still
for
a
few
years
during
the
thirties
.

The
Mill
Creek
Expressway
reused
some
portions
of
the
dead
canal
as
well
as
the
Wright-Lockland
Highway
.

The
National
Interstate
and
Defense
Highways
Act
of
0000
created
today
's
interstate
system
,
including
Interstate
00
along
the
Mill
Creek
Expressway
.

Lockland
's
past
and
future
are
directly
related
to
the
growth
of
national
transportation
and
commerce
.

Lockland
was
home
to
the
Stearns
and
Foster
Mattress
company
,
which
was
founded
in
Cincinnati
in
0000
and
moved
to
Lockland
in
0000
.

The
original
factory
and
office
building
still
stand
in
the
downtown
area
of
the
village
.

However
,
after
a
fire
in
0000
the
two
factory
buildings
,
which
sit
on
approximately
,
began
to
be
demolished
.

Local
government
Lockland
's
mayor
is
Jim
Brown
,
a
member
of
the
Mayors
Against

Guns
coalition
,
a
bipartisan
group
with
a
stated
goal
of

Man
is
a
0000
American
drama
film
directed
by
Barry
Levinson
and
written
by
Barry
Morrow
and
Ronald
Bass
.

It
tells
the
story
of
an
abrasive
and
selfish
yuppie
,
Charlie
Babbitt
,
who
discovers
that
his
estranged
father
has
died
and
bequeathed
all
of
his
multimillion-dollar
estate
to
his
other
son
,
Raymond

of
whose
existence
Charlie
was
unaware
.

Hoffman
as
Raymond
Babbitt
,
Tom
Cruise
as
Charlie
Babbitt
and
Valeria
Golino
as
Charlie
's
girlfriend
,
Susanna
.

Morrow
created
the
character
of
Raymond
after
meeting
Kim
Peek
,
a
real-life
savant
;
his
characterization
was
based
on
both
Peek
and
Bill
Sackter
,
a
good
friend
of
Morrow
who
was
the
subject
of
Bill
,
an
earlier
film
that
Morrow
wrote
.

Rain
Man
received
overwhelmingly
positive
reviews
at
the
time
of
its
release
,
praising
Hoffman
's
role
and
the
wit
and
sophistication
of
the

Plot
Charlie
Babbitt
(
Tom
Cruise
)
,
Los
Angeles
car
dealer
in
his
mid-twenties
,
is
in
the
middle
of
importing
four
grey
market
Lamborghini
s.
The
deal
is
being
threatened
by
the
EPA
,
and
if
Charlie
can
not
meet
its
requirements
he
will
lose
a
significant
amount
of
money
.

After
some
quick
subterfuge
with
an
employee
,
Charlie
leaves
for
a
weekend
trip
to
Palm
Springs
with
his
girlfriend
,
Susanna
(
Valeria
Golino
)
.

Charlie
's
trip
is
cancelled
by
news
that
his
estranged
father
,
Sanford
Babbitt
,
has
died
.

Charlie
travels
to
Cincinnati
,
Ohio
,
to
settle
the
estate
,
where
he
learns
an
undisclosed
trustee
is
inheriting
$
0
million
on
behalf
of
an
unnamed
beneficiary
,
while
all
he
is
to
receive
is
a
classic
Buick
Roadmaster
convertible
and
several
prize
rose
bushes
.

Eventually
he
learns
the
money
is
being
directed
to
a
mental
institution
,
which
is
the
home
of
his
autistic
brother
,
Raymond
(
Dustin
Hoffman
)
,
of
whose
existence
Charlie
was
previously
unaware
.

This
leads
Charlie
to
ask
the
question
that
permeates
the
movie
:
"
Why
did
n't
somebody
tell
me
I
had
a
brother
?
"

Raymond
has
autism
,
and
one
of
the
manifestations
of
his
condition
is
his
superb
recall
,
albeit
usually
with
little
understanding
of
the
subject
matter
.

He
also
has
extreme
skills
in
mathematics
(
in
those
scenes
he
merely
remembers
the
answers
,
and
with
no
understanding
of
currency
)
.

He
is
said
to
be
a
savant
by
some
doctors
.

He
is
frightened
by
change
and
adheres
to
strict
routines
(
for
example
,
his
continual
repetition
of
the
"
Who
's
on
First
?

Except
when
he
is
in
distress
,
he
shows
little
emotional
expression
and
avoids
eye
contact
.

Numbed
by
learning
that
he
has
a
brother
and
determined
to
get
what
he
believes
is
his
fair
share
of
the
Babbitt
estate
,
Charlie
takes
Raymond
on
what
becomes
a
cross-country
car
trip
(
due
to
Raymond
's
fear
of
flying
)
back
to
Los
Angeles
to
meet
with
his
attorneys
.

Charlie
intends
to
start
a
custody
battle
in
order
to
get
Raymond
's
doctor
,
Dr.
Gerald
R.
Bruner
(
Jerry
Molen
)
,
to
settle
out
of
court
for
half
of
Sanford
Babbitt
's
estate
so
that
the
mental
institution
can
maintain
custody
of
Raymond
.

Susanna
,
disgusted
by
Charlie
's
self-centeredness
and
his
attempts
at
using
his
brother
as
a
pawn
to
gain
the
money
,
leaves
Charlie
in
Cincinnati
and
disappears
.

During
the
course
of
the
journey
,
Charlie
learns
about
Raymond
's
autism
,
which
he
initially
believes
is
not
authentic
–
resulting
in
his
frequent
frustration
with
his
brother
's
antics
.

He
also
learns
about
how
his
brother
came
to
be
separated
from
his
family
,
as
a
result
of
an
accident
when
he
was
left
alone
with
Charlie
when
Charlie
was
a
baby
.

Raymond
also
sings
"
I
Saw
Her
Standing
There
"
by
The
Beatles
like
he
did
when
Charlie
was
young
,
prompting
Charlie
to
realize
that
Raymond
is
the
protective
figure
from
his
childhood
,
whom
he
falsely
remembered
as
an
imaginary
friend
named
"
Rain
Man
"
,
which
was
a
mispronunciation
of
"
Raymond
"
.

Charlie
proves
to
be
sometimes
shallow
and
exploitative
,
as
when
he
learns
that
Raymond
has
an
excellent
memory
and
takes
him
to
Las
Vegas
to
win
money
at
blackjack
by
counting
cards
.

However
,
toward
the
end
of
their
trip
Charlie
finds
himself
becoming
protective
of
Raymond
,
and
grows
to
love
him
truly
.

Charlie
finally
meets
with
his
attorney
to
try
to
get
his
share
of
his
inheritance
,
but
then
decides
that
he
no
longer
cares
about
the
money
and
really
just
wants
to
have
custody
of
his
brother
.

However
,
at
a
meeting
with
a
court-appointed
psychiatrist
and
Dr.
Bruner
,
who
is
also
a
friend
of
Charlie
's
father
and
is
left
in
charge
of
that
money
,
Raymond
is
unable
to
decide
exactly
what
he
wants
.

Eventually
,
the
psychiatrist
presses
Raymond
to
make
the
decision
,
upsetting
him
and
leading
Charlie
to
request
that
the
doctor
back
off
.

Raymond
is
allowed
to
go
back
home
to
Cincinnati
.

Charlie
,
who
has
gained
a
new
brother
and
mellowed
considerably
,
promises
Raymond
as
he
boards
an
Amtrak
train
that
he
will
visit
in
two
weeks
.

Production
Roger
Birnbaum
was
the
first
studio
executive
to
give
the
film
a

light
;
he
did
so
immediately
after
Barry

pitched
the
story
.

Birnbaum
received
"
special
thanks
"
in
the
film
's

.

Agents
at

sent
the
script
to
Hoffman
and
Bill

,
envisioning
Murray
in

and
Hoffman
in

eventually
portrayed

Almost

one
key
scene
that
was

Vincent
Canby
of
The
New

Times
called
Rain
Man
a
"
becomingly
modest
,
decently
thought-out
,
sometimes
funny

"
;
Hoffman

was
a

display
of
sustained
virtuosity
.
.
.
[
which
]
makes
no
lasting
connections
with
the
emotions
.

Its
end
effect
depends
largely
on
one
's
susceptibility
to
the
sight
of
an
actor
acting
nonstop
and
extremely
well
,
but
to
no
particularly
urgent
dramatic
purpose
.
"

Canby
considered
the
"
film
's
true
central
character
"
to
be
"
the
confused
,
economically
and
emotionally
desperate
Charlie
,
beautifully
played
by
Mr.
Cruise
.
"

Amy
Dawes
of
Variety
wrote
that
"
one
of
the
year
's
most
intriguing
film
premises
...
is
given
uneven
,
slightly
off-target
treatment
"
;
she
calls
the
road
scenes
"
hastily
,
loosely
written
,
with
much
extraneous
screen
time
,
"
but
admired
the
last
third
of
the
film
,
calling
it
a
depiction
of
"
two
very
isolated
beings
"
who
"
discover
a
common
history
and
deep
attachment
.
"

One
of
the
film
's
harshest
reviews
came
from
New

magazine
critic
Pauline
Kael
:
"
Everything
in
this
movie
is
fudged
ever
so
humanistically
,
in
a
perfunctory
,
low-pressure
way
.

And
the
picture
has
its
effectiveness
:
people
are
crying
at
it
.

Of
course
they
're
crying
at
it
–
it
's
a
piece
of
wet
kitsch

Effect
on
popular
culture
Rain
Man
s
portrayal
of
the
main
character
's
condition
has
been
seen
as
inaugurating
a
common
and
incorrect
media
stereotype
that
people
on
the
autism
spectrum
typically
have
savant
skills
,
and
references
to
Rain
Man
,
in
particular
Dustin
Hoffman
's
performance
,
have
become
a
popular
shorthand
for
autism
and
savantism
.

However
,
Rain
Man
has
also
been
seen
as
dispelling
a
number
of
other
misconceptions
about
autism
and
improving
public
awareness
of
the
failure
of
many
agencies
to
accommodate
people
with
autism
and
make
use
of
the
abilities
they
do
have
,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
savant
skills
.

Rain
Man
has
been
listed
as
one
of
the
best
movies
on
the
subject
of
autism
.

The
film
is
also
known
for
popularizing
the
misconception
that
card
counting
is
illegal
in
the
United
States
.

In
the
course
of
the
film
,
it
is
claimed
that
Qantas
is
the
only
commercial
airline
that
has
never
had
an
aircraft
crash
.

While
it
is
true
that
the
company
has
neither
lost
a
jet
airliner
nor
had
any
jet
fatalities
,
it
had
eight
fatal
accidents
and
an
aircraft
shot
down
between
0000
and
0000
,
with
the
loss
of
00
people
.

To
this
date
,
the
last
fatal
accident
suffered
by
Qantas
was
in
0000
.

The
scene
in
which
Raymond
reels
off
a
list
of
statistics
of
fatal
airline
crashes
was
cut
by
most
airlines
when
showing
the
film
in-flight
–
except
for
Qantas
,
which
even
promoted
one
of
the
movie
's
writers
to
first
class
when
he
traveled
on
their
airline
.

The
use
of
the
surname
"
Babbitt
"
for
the
brothers
may
be
in
homage
to
the
Sinclair
Lewis
novel
of
the
same
name
;
Zenith
,
the
city
in
the
novel
,
is
generally
believed
to
be
based
on
Cincinnati
.

North
College
Hill
is
a
city
in
Hamilton
County
in
the
southwestern
part
of
the
U.S.
state
of
Ohio
approximately
ten
miles
north
of
downtown
Cincinnati
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
population
was
0,000
.

The
city
takes
its
name
from
its
proximity
to
the
Cincinnati
neighborhood
of
College
Hill
(
formerly
Pleasant
Hill
)
which
borders
it
to
the
south
.

and

History
One
of
the
first
easterners
to
survey
the
area
was
John
Cleves
Symmes
,
a
judge
and
former
Congressman
from
New
Jersey
,
after
whom
Symmes
Township
is
named
.

Symmes
visited
the
area
in
0000
and
received
tentative
permission
from
the
new
Federal
government
to
purchase
a
section
of
land
between
the
Little
Miami
and
Great
Miami
River
s.
This
tract
became
known
as
the
“
Symmes
Purchase
”
or
“
Miami
Purchase
”
and
extended
south
to
the
Ohio
River
.

Several
of
the
pioneers
who
migrated
across
the
midwest
to
claim
a
part
of
Symmes
'
tract
are
buried
in
North
College
Hill
's
oldest
landmark
,
the
LaBoyteaux-Cary
cemetery
.

Established
in
approximately
0000
,
the
cemetery
includes
the
graves
of
two
Revolutionary
War
veterans
and
several
members
of
the
Cary
family
.

The
last
burial
in
the
cemetery
was
in
0000
.

Cary
family
In
0000-00
,
William
Cary
,
having
migrated
from
New
Hampshire
to
Cincinnati
in
0000
,
purchased
north
of
Cincinnati
along
what
is
now
Hamilton
Avenue
(
U.S.
Route
000
)
.

Cary
built
a
log
cabin
and
moved
his
family
to
this
“
wilderness
,
”
then
known
as
Mill
Creek
Township
.

Soon
after
,
William
Cary
purchased
an
additional
north
of
North
Bend
Road
adjacent
to
his
original
tract
,
and
sold
part
of
it
to
his
nephew
Robert
Cary
.

Robert
called
the
land
Clovernook
Farm
and
initially
erected
a
small
frame
house
for
his
family
.

In
0000
,
he
built
the
white
,
brick
house
now
known
as
Cary
Cottage
(
see
photo
)
which
stands
on
the
campus
of
the
Clovernook
Center
for
the
Blind
and
Visually
Impaired
and
is
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

Within
a
year
of
his
settlement
,
Robert
also
laid
out
the
first
community
in
the
area
,
called
Clovernook
,
on
the
east
side
of
Hamilton
Avenue
.

Robert
Cary
and
his
wife
Elizabeth
raised
nine
children
,
two
of
whom
,
Alice
and
Phoebe
,
became
well-known
poetesses
and
writers
.

Both
girls
began
having
their
poems
published
as
teenagers
,
and
they
eventually
counted
among
their
admirers
Massachusetts
poet
and
abolitionist
John
Greenleaf
Whittier
,
New
York
Tribune
newspaper
editor
Horace
Greeley
,
and
author
Edgar
Allan
Poe
,
who
pronounced
Alice
Cary
's
Pictures
of
Memory
,
"
one
of
the
most
musically
perfect
lyrics
in
the
English
language
.
"

Cary
Cottage
became
the
first
home
for
blind
women
in
Ohio
through
the
work
of
the
Trader
sisters
,
Florence
and
Georgia
(
who
was
blind
)
.

In
0000
the
Cary
house
and
the
land
surrounding
it
were
purchased
by
William
Procter
,
grandson
of
the
Procter
&
Gamble
co-founder
,
in
order
to
give
them
in
trust
to
the
Traders
.

The
sisters
used
the
land
to
establish
the
Clovernook
home
and
provide
employment
to
visually
impaired
women
as
a
source
of
dignity
and
direction
.

Today
,
the
Clovernook
Center
for
the
Blind
and
Visually
Impaired
offers
instruction
,
employment
,
community
living
and
low
vision
services
for
men
and
women
,
and
runs
three
manufacturing
departments
,
including
one
of
the
world
's
largest
volume
producers
of
Braille
publications
.

Religious
and
legal
reform
Isaac
Mayer
Wise
In
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
North
College
Hill
was
the
home
of
Dr.
Isaac
Mayer
Wise
,
who
has
been
called
“
the
most
prominent
Jew
of
his
time
in
the
United
States
”
for
his
influence
as
one
of
the
early
leaders
of
Reform
Judaism
in
America
.

In
0000
Wise
and
his
wife
Therese
bought
a
house
and
farm
near
the
current
intersection
of
Goodman
and
Hamilton
Avenues
where
they
raised
a
family
of
ten
children
.

Wise
added
to
the
original
farmhouse
until
it
included
00
rooms
on
various
levels
.

The
farm
,
meanwhile
,
allowed
him
to
carry
out
agricultural
experiments
and
to
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
own
his
own
land
.

This
privilege
,
denied
Jews
in
his
native
Austria
,
represented
for
him
the
freedom
he
enjoyed
in
the
United
States
.

Following
Wise
's
death
in
0000
,
the
farm
was
the
home
of
his
daughter
and
granddaughter
,
respectively
,
until
0000
.

Tumey
v.
Ohio
In
0000
North
College
Hill
Mayor
A.
R.
Pugh
was
involved
in
a
Prohibition
case
that
rose
to
national
significance
when
it
was
appealed
all
the
way
to
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
.

The
court
's
decision
in
this
case
continues
to
provide
precedent
today
in
many
cases
involving
judicial
impartiality
.

Development
of
a
community
Through
the
nineteenth
century
,
as
College
Hill
to
the
south
and
Mount
Healthy
to
the
north
matured
into
towns
,
the
area
that
was
to
become
North
College
Hill
remained
largely
farmland
.

Beginning
in
0000
,
saw
mill
owner
John
Meyer
used
his
surplus
lumber
to
build
a
subdivision
of
small
homes
north
of
Galbraith
Road
and
west
of
Hamilton
Avenue
and
called
it
Meyerville
.

Within
the
next
ten
years
,
two
other
groups
of
homes
–
Clovernook
,
east
of
Hamilton
Avenue
,
and
Sunshine
,
south
of
Galbraith
and
west
of
Hamilton
–
were
started
.

The
three
subdivisions
,
with
a
total
of
about
000
residents
,
were
incorporated
as
the
Village
of
North
College
Hill
in
0000
.

As
the
automobile
stretched
commuting
distances
,
the
village
's
affordable
housing
attracted
a
growing
population
,
and
it
increased
from
about
0,000
to
0,000
residents
during
the
0000s
.

In
0000
,
the
village
incorporated
as
a
City
and
continued
to
grow
until
the
population
stabilized
at
its
peak
of
around
00,000
by
0000
.

A
few
homes
were
removed
for
the
completion
of
Ronald
Reagan
Cross
County
Highway
(
Ohio
State
Route
000
)
in
0000
.

Population
has
declined
more
or
less
steadily
over
the
past
four
decades
,
according
to
the
U.S.
Census
:
0000
00,000
;
0000
00,000
;
0000
00,000
;
0000
00,000
;
0000
0,000
.

In
0000
,
Money
magazine
listed
the
city
sixth
among
places
"
where
homes
are
affordable
.
"

On
November
0
,
0000
a
ballot
initiative
to
make
North
College
Hill
a
charter
city
was
passed
by
the
voters
.

In
0000
North
College
Hill
was
rated
the
"
best
place
to
raise
kids
in
Ohio
"
by
Bloomberg
Businessweek
,
based
on
such
factors
as
school
performance
,
the
number
of

,
crime
statistics
,
cost
of

Norwood
is
the
second
most
populous
city
in
Hamilton
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
city
is
an
enclave
of
the
larger
city
of
Cincinnati
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Originally
settled
as
an
early
suburb
of
Cincinnati
in
the
wooded
countryside
north
of
the
city
,
the
area
is
characterized
by
older
homes
and
tree-lined
streets
.

History
The
area
now
known
as
Norwood
was
settled
in
the
early
00th
century
as
a
coach
stop
along
the
Montgomery
Road
turnpike
near
the
present
day
intersection
of
Smith
Road
.

The
village
was
originally
named
Sharpsburg
after
an
early
settler
named
John
Sharpe
.

It
was
informally
referred
to
as
"
Northwood
"
due
to
its
location
north
of
Cincinnati
and
being
heavily
wooded
countryside
.

Much
of
the
area
was
horse
farms
or
fruit
and
vegetable
orchards
.

The
Marietta
and
Cincinnati
Railroad
and
Cincinnati
,
Lebanon
and
Northern
Railway
were
built
through
the
area
,
leading
to
increasing
settlement
in
the
countryside
.

In
0000
,
a
local
dry
goods
merchant
named
L.
C.
Hopkins
subdivided
of
his
own
land
near
the
intersection
of
Hopkins
Avenue
and
Montgomery
Road
.

Shortly
thereafter
,
other
subdivisions
were
planned
.

The
area
quickly
developed
into
one
of
Cincinnati
's
original
suburbs
.

It
was
at
Hopkins
’
suggestion
that
the
name
of
Norwood
was
substituted
for
that
of
Sharpsburg
.

Much
of
the
remaining
land
from
which
the
city
originated
were
farms
of
the
Mills
,
Smith
,
Langdon
,
Williams
,
Durrell
and
Drake
families
.

The
village
was
incorporated
into
a
city
on
May
00
,
0000
,
under
the
name
Norwood
.

Geography
Norwood
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
−
00.000000
)
.
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

The
southern
,
eastern
,
and
western
areas
of
the
city
lie
mostly
on
flat
terrain
,
while
the
northern
half
of
the
city
is
characterized
by
a
steeper
elevation
.

The
highest
point
in
Norwood
is
at
the
Norwood
Indian
Mound
burial
site
in
Tower
Park
at
above
sea
level
.

That
site
is
one
of
the
highest
land
elevations
in
southwest
Ohio
.

It
is
believed
the
burial
mound
was
built
at
that
site
due
to
the
high
elevation
.

Near
the
burial
mound
are
two
large
water
towers
,
built
in
the
00th
century
,
which
Norwood
uses
to
store
water
and
regulate
water
pressure
throughout
its
City
.

The
towers
were
curious
points
of
interest
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Because
they
were
built
with
spiral
staircases
(
long
since
removed
)
,
people
rode
horses
or
took
carriage
rides
to
the
towers
in
order
to
climb
the
stairs
and
view
growing
Cincinnati
to
the
south
and
countryside
to
the
north
.

Norwood
is
credited
with
coming
to
the
aid
of
Cincinnati
residents
during
the
Ohio
River
flood
of
0000
.

Cincinnati
's
drinking
water
was
largely
contaminated
so
their
residents
depended
on
Norwood
for
fresh
water
,
which
Norwood
had
stored
safely
in
the
towers
,
above
flood
waters
.

is

.

Economy
Early
industry
Norwood
has
enjoyed
a
strong
tradition
of
industry
and
manufacturing
dating
back
to
the
historic
Norwood
Brick
plant
of
the
late
00th
century
,
which
provided
clay
brick
for
the
construction
of
many
of
Cincinnati
's
historic
buildings
.

As
the
city
is
ideally
situated
between
several
major
railways
,
state
roads
and
interstate
highways
,
it
has
traditionally
been
an
attractive
location
for
businesses
and
corporations
in
the
area
.

In
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
the
relatively
small
community
held
the
distinction
of
producing
more
goods
per
capita
than
any
other
city
in
the
world
.

Prominent
Norwood
industries
included
:
United
States
Printing
&
Lithographing
Company
,
Mead
Container
Corporation
,
American
Laundry
Machine
Company
,
Globe
Wernicke
,
Bulloch
Electric
Company
,
Allis-Chalmers
,
Siemens
,
J.H.
Day
Corporation
,
Zumbiel
Box
,
dozens
of
tool
and
die
makers
and
other
industrial
concerns
.

Corporations
founded
and
still
located
in
Norwood
include
The
United
States
Playing
Card
Company
and
United
Dairy
Farmers
.

However
,
between
0000
and
0000
the
General
Motors
and
Fisher
Body
automobile
assembly
plants
were
far
and
away
the
city
's
major
employer
in
terms
of
production
,
payroll
and
employees
.

For
decades
Norwood
's
fortunes
rose
(
and
later
fell
)
with
these
businesses
.

Located
across
Norwood
's
main
thoroughfare
from
Norwood
City
Hall
,
the
Norwood
Assembly
plant
built
Chevrolet
and
Pontiac
automobiles
and
provided
Norwood
with
approximately
00
%
of
its
tax
base
from
payroll
taxes
.

The
Norwood
Plant
produced
00
%
of
the
Chevrolet
Camaro
and
Pontiac
Firebird
"
muscle
cars
"
of
the
0000s
.

The
prevalence
of
railroads
through
the
area
is
a
main
reason
the
plant
flourished
.

The
railways
were
able
to
provide
a
steady
flow
of
parts
into
the
plant
and
an
equally
steady
flow
of
assembled
automobiles
out
of
the
plant
.

The
plant
used
the
enlarged
McCoullough
Yard
,
originally
built
for
the
McCoullough
Seed
Company
in
the
0000s
.

Closing
of
General
Motors
Citing
its
obsolescence
,
expense
,
and
high
worker
absentee
rate
,
GM
announced
the
closing
of
the
Norwood
plant
and
ten
other
GM
facilities
on
November
0
,
0000
.

The
Norwood
facility
produced
its
last
vehicle
August
00
,
0000
–
a
Chevrolet
Camaro
.

At
the
time
of
its
closing
the
plant
employed
approximately
0000
workers
.

That
date
came
to
be
known
in
Norwood
as
"
Black
Wednesday
"
.

The
closing
of
the
assembly
plant
nearly
dealt
a
death
blow
to
Norwood
’s
economy
.

As
the
main
factory
building
sat
vacant
(
for
nearly
00
years
)
,
the
city
faced
economic
catastrophe
and
possible
bankruptcy
if
replacement
income
was
not
found
.

Due
to
the
plant
's
unique
location
between
Interstate
00
,
Interstate
00
,
the
Norwood
Lateral
,
U.S.
Route
00
and
Ohio
State
Route
000
,
the
city
approached
GM
about
tearing
down
the
old
plant
so
Norwood
could
develop
it
.

Initially
GM
refused
,
but
after
settling
an
unresolved
tax
dispute
(
GM
potentially
owed
the
city
of
Norwood
millions
of
dollars
in
back
taxes
)
GM
agreed
to
demolish
the
remaining
buildings
and
to
donate
ownership
of
the
land
to
the
City
of
Norwood
.

Central
Parke
revitalization
The
rebirth
of
the
former
GM
Assembly
Plant
site
became
the
first
of
several
large
development
projects
.

In
0000
,
the
first
phase
of
development
took
place
with
the
construction
of
the
Central
Parke
complex
on
the
former
GM
Assembly
site
.

A
new
roadway
,
Wall
Street
,
was
built
and
the
Grande
Central
Station
outdoor
mall
was
opened
with
a
discount
movie
theater
along
with
a
mix
of
restaurants
,
retail
,
and
light
industry
businesses
.

Behind
the
mall
along
the
newly
extended
Wesley
Avenue
,
a
green
space
and
lake
were
added
in
addition
to
several
businesses
including
a
technical
college
and
medical
billing
firm
.

In
0000
,
phase
two
took
place
as
the
city
added
a
mixed-use
light
industrial
and
office
building
at
the
northeast
corner
of
Montgomery
and
Sherman
Avenues
.

Commonly
referred
to
as
the
Matrixx/Convergys
building
,
the
facility
opened
with
two
retail
financial
institutions
,
a
marketing
firm
,
a
satellite
television
customer-service
center
,
a
medical
consulting/MRI/diagnostic
laboratory
and
telephone
company
firm
as
initial
tenants
.

The
new
office
building
was
conveniently
able
to
utilize
the
still
standing
GM
Assembly
Plant
parking
garage
located
on
Elm
Avenue
.

Bennett
Avenue
,
a
two-block
city
street
,
was
eliminated
with
the
new
construction
.

Greenspace
was
added
along
Montgomery
Road
.

Rookwood
Pavilion
By
0000
,
successful
development
of
those
former
GM
properties
spurred
interest
by
other
developers
to
choose
Norwood
for
further
commercial
enterprises
.

The
Rookwood
Pavilion
outdoor
shopping
plaza
was
constructed
at
the
former
site
of
the
Leblond
Machine
Tool
Company
on
Edmondson
Road
.

A
high-rise
office
tower
with
an
insurance
company
,
medical
clinic
,
and
culinary
was
constructed
on
the
northern
edge
of
the
property
.

Wildly
successful
,
it
was
followed
in
0000
by
an
adjoining
open-air
shopping
mall
,
Rookwood
Commons
,
on
Edwards
Road
.

The
open-air
shopping
mall
contained
an
eclectic
mix
of
restaurants
,
clothing
stores
,
and
gift
stores
,
previously
not
found
in
Hamilton
County
.

Much
of
the
success
of
local
businesses
is
due
to
the
central
location
in
Cincinnati
,
and
close
proximity
to
interstates
00
and
00
,
using
Ohio
State
Route
000
,
locally
known
as
the
Norwood
Lateral
.

Eminent
domain
In
0000
,
further
development
was
planned
for
the
area
located
near
Interstate
00
,
between
Edwards
,
Edmondson
Road
.

Cornerstone
of
Norwood
was
built
at
the
intersection
of
Edmondson
Road
and
Williams
Avenue
.

That
complex
contained
a
neurological/spinal
clinic
,
adult
fitness
center
and
office
buildings
.

A
second
development
,
the
$
000
million
Rookwood
Exchange
,
was
planned
on
the
southern
edge
of
this
area
directly
across
the
street
from
the
Rookwood
Pavilion
.

However
,
the
area
where
Rookwood
Exchange
was
to
be
built
was
already
occupied
by
a
small
neighborhood
.

The
city
,
declaring
the
neighborhood
of
about
00
homes
and
businesses
as
"
blighted
”
,
attempted
to
use
eminent
domain
to
obtain
the
land
from
the
property
owners
.

Three
remaining
owners
in
the
neighborhood
fought
Norwood
’s
use
of
eminent
domain
and
refused
to
sell
their
property
.

The
dispute
eventually
made
national
headlines
when
it
was
brought
before
the
Ohio
Supreme
Court
in
Norwood
,
Ohio
v.
Horney
.

In
0000
,
the
court
ruled
unanimously
for
the
homeowners
and
city
developers
were
forced
to
return
ownership
of
the
three
properties
to
the
homeowners
.

The
future
plans
for
the
site
are
new
restaurants
,
shopping
,
cinema
,
and
condominium
living
.

The
project
was
to
start
spring
0000
and
to
be
completed
in
0000
but
was
forced
to
be
pushed
back
.

The
city
completed
its
acquisition
of
the
property
and
broke
ground
on
Rookwood
Exhange
in
April
0000
.

Linden
Pointe
Norwood
continued
to
develop
commercial
properties
by
capitalizing
on
developing
other
parcels
of
land
which
had
been
idle
for
years
.

In
0000
,
the
city
broke
ground
for
the
Linden
Pointe
project
at
the
former
American
Laundry
Machine
Company
,
which
closed
in
the
0000s
and
Globe
Wernicke
,
which
closed
in
the
0000s
,
both
located
near
Montgomery
Road
and
the
Norwood
Lateral
.

The
city
had
been
eying
the
property
for
development
for
several
years
.

However
,
due
to
the
nature
of
manufacturing
at
Globe
Wernicke
,
contaminants
were
present
in
the
ground
which
prevented
new
construction
.

Norwood
was
eventually
able
to
utilize
federal
and
state
cleanup
funds
to
eliminate
those
hazards
.

By
fall
0000
,
the
former
American
Laundry
building
had
been
renovated
with
the
building
's
original
historic
facade
preserved
.

The
building
was
re-habbed
with
"
Greening
"
features
and
re-opened
with
a
cable-television
service
center
and
telephone
company
.

A
multi-story
office
complex
was
also
constructed
at
the
adjoining
Globe
Wernicke
end
of
the
property
.

As
of
November
,
0000
,
an
architectural
firm
was
the
first
announced
tenant
.

In
order
to
cater
to
the
new
development
,
the
street
scape
surrounding
Linden
Pointe
was
altered
for
aesthetic
and
traffic
purposes
.

Several
historic
buildings
on
the
narrow
block
at
the
intersection
of
Montgomery
Road
and
Carthage
Avenue
were
razed
to
"
open
up
"
the
office
park
's
visibility
from
Interstate
00
.

Montgomery
Road
and
Norwood
Avenues
were
widened
,
and
two
city
blocks
of
Carthage
Avenue
and
an
adjoining
on-ramp
to
State
Route
000
were
permanently
closed
.

A
boulevard
entrance
was
added
alongside
Linden
Point
along
the
former
West
Norwood
Avenue
.

(
This
street
had
previously
been
closed
to
traffic
in
the
0000s
for
urban
renewal
)
.

Current
and
future
development
In
0000
,
Norwood
's
economic
boom
continued
with
the
expansion
of
the
Siemens
plant
located
on
Forest
and
Park
Avenues
.

The
plant
,
which
assembles
and
tests
large
electric
motors
used
in
industrial
and
factory
automation
,
completed
a
two-year
$
00
million
expansion
.

The
project
included
:
$
00
million
for
new
machinery
,
equipment
and
technology
;
$
0
million
to
expand
and
renovate
existing
buildings
;
and
$
0M
in
additional
needs
.

The
project
ensured
retention
of
000
skilled
workforce
jobs
.

Norwood
is
also
currently
in
the
midst
of
two
additional
projects
located
in
the
Montgomery
Road
central
business
corridor
.

Surrey
Square
Mall
went
through
a
major
major
expansion
with
addition
of
a
Kroger
anchor
store
,
a
large
cafeteria-sized
McDonald
's
restaurant
and
several
mid-size
businesses
.

The
old
Sherwin-Williams
paint
store
at
the
intersection
of
Montgomery
and
Smith
Roads
was
torn
down
in
0000
and
the
new
medical
center
of
Norwood
was
completed
in
0000
.

Education
The
Norwood
City
School
District
consists
of
three
elementary
schools
:
Norwood
View
,
Sharpsburg
,
and
Williams
.

The
district
's
sole
middle
and
high

are
located
adjacent
to
one
another
on
Sherman
Avenue
.

Norwood
City
School
District
also
operates
the
Five
Points
Preschool
.

The
original
Norwood
High
School
was
built
in
0000
on
Sherman
Avenue
.

That
building
now
houses
Norwood
Middle
School
.

In
0000
,
the
high
school
gym
and
offices
were
used
to
film
several
scenes
for
the
Tom
Selleck
movie
"
An
Innocent
Man
"
(
0000
)
.

A
newer
high
school
was
built
as
a
state-of-the-art
facility
in
0000
,
and
houses
a
planetarium
,
television
studio
for
both
Norwood
City

a
wide
range
of
municipal
services
.

The
City
is
patrolled
by
a
police
department
consisting
of
00
full-time
officers
and
three
full-time
dispatchers
.

In
0000
the
residents
of
Silverton
and
neighboring
Deer
Park
,
Ohio
voted
to
form
the
Deer
Park
Silverton
Joint
Fire
District
.

The
district
offers
fire
protection
and
EMS/paramedic
services
to
the
communities
of
Silverton
and
Deer
Park
,
as
well
as
portions
of
Amberley
Village
and
Columbia
Township
.

Residents
of
Silverton
enjoy
two
parks
:
Ralph
Ficke
Memorial
Park
and
Silverton
Park
.

Ficke
Park
was
the
larger
of
the
two
at
.

It
offered
a
playground
,
baseball
diamonds
,
a
regulation
size
soccer
field
,
full
court
basketball
,
hard
court
tennis
and
a
batting
cage
.

Two
shelters
were
available
for
rental
.

Park
events
include
an
annual
Easter
egg
hunt
and
a
summer
concert
series
.

The
city
council
unanimously
approved
a
land
swap
with
Cincinnati
Public
Schools
in
order
to
build
a
new
school
on
half
of
Ficke
Park
.

The
move
is
opposed
by
nearby
residents
,
especially
in
neighboring
Sycamore
Township
who
argue
that
they
were
not
consulted
or
informed
of
the
proposed
land
swap
.

The
land
swap
will
likely
be
challenged
on
the
premise
that
the
land
deed
forbids
the
use
of
the
land
for
anything
other
than
a
park
or
similar
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
the
Cincinnati
Board
of
Education
approved
the
land
swap
.

As
a
result
of
the
land
swap
CPS
now
owns
half
of
Ficke
park
.

The
CPS
owned
half
contains
the
shelters
(
that
are
no
longer
available
for
rental
)
,
the
tennis
courts
(
which
no
longer
have
nets
)
,
the
playground
and
the
basketball
court
.

When
construction
for
the
new
school
begins
,
all
these
facilities
will
be
lost
.

Some
are
scheduled
to
be
rebuilt
in
the
remaining
half
of
the
park
.

Silverton
Park
is
located
in
the
center
of
town
in
a
"
village
green
"
setting
.

The
Kuhnell
Museum
,
a
replica
of
the
city
's
original
train
depot
,
is
located
in
the
park
.

The
museum
is
a
source
of
great
pride
for
Silverton
residents
.

Johnny
Kuhnell
,
the
city
's
Chief
of
Police
from
0000
to
0000
,
envisioned
a
replicated
station
as
a
focal
point
of
the
community
,
so
he
organized
an
effort
to
reconstruct
the
station
.

His
goal
was
realized
in
0000
when
construction
of
the
replica
was
completed
.

The
museum
was
rededicated
in
honor
and
memory
of
Chief
Kuhnell
in
0000
.

The
station
today
serves
as
a
museum
dedicated
to
the
preservation
of
Silverton
history
for
future
generations
.

Inside
you
will
find
photographs
,
articles
and
memorabilia
related
to
the
Silverton
area
from
the
0000s
to
the
present
.

Visitors
will
gain
perspective
on
the
city
's
history
and
the
pride
employed
by
area
pioneers
.

The
museum
is
open
to
the
public
on
the
second
and
fourth
Sunday
of
each
month
from
0:00
p.m.
to

April
through

.

History
Formed
out
of
Columbia
and
Sycamore
townships
,
Silverton
had
its
beginnings
in
the
post
-
Revolutionary
War
land
grants
.

In
0000
David
Mosner
opened
a
general
store
at
the
crossroads
of
Plainfield
Pike
and
Montgomery
Road
.

For
the
next
several
decades
the
surrounding
town
was
known
alternately
as
"
Mosner
"
or
"
Enterprise
"
.

The
Mosner
name
was
formalized
in
0000
when
a
post
office
opened
under
that
designation
.

The
future
of
the
community
was
forever
changed
in
0000
when
the
Cincinnati
,
Lebanon
&
Northern
Railroad
opened
a
line
through
town
,
enabling
residents
to
commute
to
jobs
in
Cincinnati
.

Seth
Haines
and
Robert
Cresap
platted
Silverton
's
first
subdivision
shortly
thereafter
.

It
is
widely
accepted
that
the
town
was
renamed
Silverton
in
honor
of
Haines
'
wife
,
Elizabeth
Silver
Haines
.

In
0000
the
community
was
incorporated
as
the
Hamlet
of
Silverton
.

The
early
subdivisions
were
designed
to
appeal
to
investors
as
well
as
prospective
homeowners
.

The
lots
were
generally
small
,
most
of
them
with
frontages
.

Silverton
was
promoted
as
a
healthful
and
economical
alternative
to
life
in
the
city
.

The
hamlet
slowly
developed
into
a
suburb
over
the
next
twenty
years
,
with
village
status
attained
by
general
election
in
0000
.

The
village
was
by
then
served
by
the
Interurban
Railway
&
Terminal
Company
line
,
which
ran
along
Montgomery
Road
(
no
U.S.
Route
00
)
,
as
well
as
the
CL&N
.

Residents
regularly
commuted
to
jobs
in
Cincinnati
.

By
0000
the
village
had
a
population
of
000
.

Silverton
grew
rapidly
over
the
next
00
years
,
attaining
city
status
in
0000
with
a
population
exceeding
0,000
.

Around
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
the
John
C.
Meier
Grape
Juice
Company
purchased
land
along
the
railroad
line
and
began
producing
grape
juice
and
wine
in
Silverton
.

Now
known
as
Meier
's
Wine
Cellars
,
it
is
both
the
oldest
and
largest
winery
in
Ohio
.

Silverton
's
demographics
began
to
shift
in
the
0000s
when
African-American
families
,
attracted
by
the
city
's
strong
neighborhoods
and
convenient
location
,
began
to
reside
in
the
area
.

In
order
to
avoid
the
"
white
flight
"
experienced
by
many
other
communities
,
the
Silverton
Neighborhood
Association
was
formed
to
break
through
cultural
barriers
and
to
promote
dialogue
between
neighbors
.

As
a
result
,
Silverton
transcended
racial
issues
and
transformed
itself
into
an
intentionally
integrated
community
.

Silverton
today
is
a
community
of
rich
diversity
in
the
heart
of
a
major
metropolitan
area
.

Its
location
northeast
of
Cincinnati
along
Interstate
00
and
Montgomery
Road
(
U.S.
Route
00
)
provides
residents
with
easy
access
to
a
wealth
of
recreational
and
cultural
amenities
.

Homeowners
enjoy
living
in
stable
,
established
neighborhoods
of
historic
homes
with
tree
canopies
served
by
a
mix
of
retail
and
service
businesses
.

The
spirit
of
volunteerism
is
alive
and
well
as
demonstrated
by
a
number
of
community
organizations
,
including
the
Silverton
Business
Association
,
the
Silverton
Block
Watch
Association
(
Ohio
's
largest
)
,
the
Play
Field
Mother
's
Club
,
and
the
Silverton
Sweet
Pea
Society
.

Silverton
received
recognition
as
a

History
In

0000
,
Abraham
Covalt
established
a
small
fortified
settlement
called
Covalt
Station
in
what
is
now
Terrace
Park
.

The
area
was
surrounded
by
Shawnee
settlements
,
and
the
Shawnee
were
hostile
towards
the
white
settlement
in
their
midst
.

Covalt
Station
had
to
be
abandoned
in
0000
due
to
continuing
attacks
by
the
Shawnee
,
and
white
settlers
only
returned
after
the
infamous
General
"
Mad
Anthony
"
Wayne
won
victory
over
the
Shawnee
and
secured
a
treaty
granting
all
of
southern
Ohio
to
the
United
States
.

Before
roads
and
railroads
connected
the
village
to
other
nearby
settlements
,
such
as
Milford
,
most
residents
of
Terrace
Park
kept
cattle
and
chickens
,
and
engaged
in
other
agricultural
activities
for
their
own
subsistence
,
and
had
"
homesteads
"
as
opposed
to
the
ordered
residential
village
of
today
.

Terrace
Park
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
and
was
the
winter
residence
of
the
Robinson
Circus
until
0000
.

During
the
time
that
the
circus
wintered
in
Terrace
Park
,
it
was
not
unusual
for
elephants
to
roam
free
about
the
village
,
until
the
village
council
asked
that
they
be
restrained
in
0000
.

St.
Thomas
Episcopal
Church
is
a
historic
building

History
Indian
Hill
began
as
a
farming
community
,
which
from
about
0000
began
to
attract
Cincinnatians
,
who
bought
up
its
farmhouses
as
rural
weekend
destinations
.

They
reached
Indian
Hill
on

Swing
Line
,

is
now
the
location
of
Indian
Hill
's
administration
building
at

Run

The
rolling
country
appealed
to
a
group
of
four
Cincinnati
businessmen
who
had
built
homes
there
in

early

and
envisioned
a
more
ambitious
rural
settlement

to
join

Realty
Co.

assembled

and
divided
some

sold
for

a
district
of
grand
mansions
with
stables
and

grew

History
The
city
derives
its
name
from
a
fort
erected
on
its
site
in
0000
as
a
local
outpost
in
the
War
of
0000
,
which
was
commenced
by
Col.
James
Findlay
and
named
in
honor
of
that
officer
.

The
history
of
Findlay
as
a
village
began
on
July
0
,
0000
,
when
Joseph
Vance
of
Urbana
,
William
Neill
of
Columbus
and
Elnathan
Cory
of
New
Carlisle
entered
the
area
and
laid
out
the
site
.

It
was
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
.

During
the
0000s
,
Findlay
was
a
booming
center
of
oil
and
natural
gas
production
,
though
the
supply
of
petroleum
had
dwindled
by
the
early
00th
century
.

The
completion
of
Interstate
00
in
the
0000s
added
to
the
growth
of
Findlay
.

Findlay
hosted
the
highly
competitive
Ohio
State
Music
Festival
in
0000
.

A
young
cornet
player
,
Warren
G.
Harding
,
and
his
Citizens
'
Cornet
Band
of
Marion
placed
third
in
the
competition
.

Harding
would
go
on
to
be
elected
the
00th
President
of
the
United
States
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
the
only
known
lynching
in
the
history
of
Hancock
County
occurred
when
a
mob
of
0,000
men
,
many
"
respectable
citizens
"
,
broke
into
the
county
jail
in
Findlay
.

They
lynched
Mr.
Lytle
,
who
had
fatally
injured
his
wife
and
two
daughters
with
a
hatchet
the
day
before
,
by
hanging
him
twice
(
first
from
the
bridge
,
then
a
telegraph
pole
)
and
finally
shooting
his
body
over
a
dozen
times
.

The
authorities
had
intended
to
secretly
convey
the
prisoner
to
a
suburb
at
0
o'clock
,
where
a
train
was
to
have
been
taken
for
Lima
,
but
their
plans
were
frustrated
by
the
mob
.

In
0000
,
American
songwriter
Tell
Taylor
wrote
the
standard
,
"
Down
by
the
Old
Mill
Stream
"
while
fishing
along
the
Blanchard
River
in
Findlay
.

The
song
was
published
in

,
Findlay
had
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
community

whose
odd
habits
include
alphabetizing
the
groceries
in

the
ringing
telephone
.

When
his
publisher
,
Julian
,

Tyler
shows
,
with
a
fine
clarity
,
the
mingling
of
misery
and
contentment
in
the
daily
lives
of
her
families
,
reminds
us
how
alike
--

distinct
--
happy
and
unhappy
families
can
be
.

Muriel
Pritchett
is
as
appealing
a
woman
as
Miss
Tyler
has
created
;
and
upon
the
quiet
Macon
she
lavishes
the
kind
of
intelligent
consideration
that
he
only
intermittently
gets
from
his
own
womenfolk

Despite

(
The
reason

"
McComb
"
instead
of
"
Macomb
"
,
is
that
the
village
was
named
by
a

,

.

Plot
The
story
is
loosely
based
on
the
real-life
murders
of
civil
rights
workers
in
Mississippi
in
0000
.

After
the
three
are
reported
missing
,
two
FBI
agents
are
sent
to
investigate
the
incident
in
rural
Jessup
County
,
Mississippi
(
modeled
after
Neshoba
County
where
the
real
murders
took
place
)
.

The
two
agents
take
completely
different
approaches
:
Agent
Alan
Ward
(
Dafoe
)
,
a
young
liberal
northerner
,
takes
a
direct
approach
to
the
investigation
;
Agent
Rupert
Anderson
(
Hackman
)
,
a
former
Mississippi
sheriff
who
understands
the
intricacies
of
race
relations
in
the
South
,
takes
a
more
subtle
tack
.

It
is
very
hard
for
the
two
to
work
in
the
town
,
as
the
local
sheriff
's
office
is
linked
to
a
major
branch
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
,
and
the
agents
can
not
talk
to
the
local
black
community
,
due
to
their
fear
of
Klan
retaliation
.

Slowly
but
steadily
,
relations
between
the
FBI
and
the
local
Jessup
County
sheriff
's
office
deteriorate
,
as
do
relations
between
Ward
and
Anderson
.

Things
boil
over
when
the
bodies
are
found
and
the
deputy
sheriff
,
Clinton
Pell
(
Brad
Dourif
)
,
realizes
that
his
wife
gave
their
locations
to
Anderson
,
and
he
assaults
her
.

When
Anderson
sees
her
in
the
hospital
,
he
storms
off
to
confront
Pell
but
is
stopped
by
Ward
.

After
a
brief
scuffle
,
the
two
agree
that
they
will
work
together
and
bring
down
the
Jessup
County
branch
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
using
Anderson
's
as
yet
untried
approach
.

The
new
tactics
begin
when
the
mayor
is
abducted
.

He
is
taken
to
a
remote
shack
and
left
on
his
own
with
a
black
man
(
played
by
Badja
Djola
)
wearing
a
rudimentary
mask
,
similar
to
those
used
by
KKK
members
in
the
film
.

Relating
a
story
of
how
a
young
black
man
was
castrated
by
the
KKK
,
he
implies
that
the
mayor
will
likewise
be
mutilated
unless
he
talks
,
by
wielding
a
razor
blade
while
relating
the
tale
.

In
reality
,
the
abductor
is
an
FBI
operative
specially
flown
in
to
intimidate
the
mayor
.

The
mayor
gives
the
operative
a
comprehensive
description
of
the
killings
,
including
the
names
of
those
involved
;
although
not
admissible
in
court
,
this
information
proves
invaluable
to
Anderson
and
Ward
and
moves
the
investigation
forward
.

Anderson
uses
the
new
information
to
send
fake
invitations
to
the
involved
KKK
parties
,
who
turn
up
for
a
meeting
.

They
soon
realize
it
's
a
set
up
and
leave
without
discussing
the
murders
.

The
FBI
,
who
are
eavesdropping
,
home
in
on
Lester
Cowens
,
a
junior
member
of
the
outfit
,
as
being
particularly
nervous
and
unable
to
stop
talking
.

He
is
later
picked
up
by
the

He
then
is
dropped
off
in
the
black
side
of
the
segregated
community
to
"
think
"
about
his
position
.

Anderson
pays
a
visit
to
the
barbershop
where
Deputy
Sheriff
Pell
is
getting
a
shave
with
a
straight
razor
.

Anderson
slips
in
the
place
of
the
barber
allowing
him
to
ensure
that
Pell
stays
still
while
Anderson
threatens
him
,
nicking
him
with
the
razor
.

Anderson
then
brutally
beats
Pell
,
both
for
his
role
in
the
murders
and
his
assault
of
his
wife
.

Ward
,
waiting
outside
and
unable

bear
the
ongoing
beating
,
attempts
to
go
in

he
is
stopped
by
the
other
FBI
men
Anderson
has
called
in
,
and
he
silently
remembers
his
pledge
to
do
things
Anderson
's
way
.

Pell
is
left
spinning
in
a
barber
's
chair
,
unconscious
,
as
Anderson
leaves
.

A
nervous
Lester
Cowens
is
at
home
when
his
window
is
shot
out
.

On
the
lawn
is
a
burning
cross
.

Cowens
tries
to
flee
in
his
truck
but
is
caught
by
three
hooded
men
who
begin
to
hang
him
.

The
FBI
arrive
,
rescue
Cowens
,
and
chase
the
thugs
to
the
sound
of
gunshots

Out
of

,
the
abductors
stop
running
away
and
remove
their
masks
to
reveal
that
they
are
also

Cowens
,
believing
his
life
is
in
danger
because
his
KKK
co-conspirators
think
he
'll
talk
,
does
just
that
.

The
FBI
now
has
evidence
admissible
in
court
and
can
prosecute
the
culprits
.

They
charge
them
with
civil
rights
violations
to
ensure
they
will
be
tried
at
the
federal
level
;
four
of
them
had
previously
been
convicted
in
a
state
court
of
firebombing
a
black

's
home
,
only
to
receive
five-year
suspended

.

Most

found
guilty

receive
sentences
from
three

Sheriff
Stuckey
is
acquitted

The
mayor
,
who
was
not
charged
with
anything
,
hangs
himself
.

Pell
's
wife
returns
to

home
,
which
has
been
completely
ransacked

She
resolves
to
stay

Cast
Historical
background
Mississippi
Burning
was
based
on
the
historical
events
surrounding
the
murders
of
three
Mississippi
civil
rights
workers
.

The
story
was
first
turned
into
a
0000
television
docudrama
titled
Attack
on
Terror
:
The
FBI
vs.
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
,
depicting
many
of
the
same
events
as
the
film
.

Neither
production
gave
the
real
names
of
the
murderers
,
due
to
legal
considerations
,
and
Mississippi
Burning
does
not
mention
the
victims
(
who
are
referred
to
as
"
the
Boys
"
)
by
name
in
the
film
.

In
the
film
credits
they
are
simply
identified
as
"
Goatee
"
,
based
on
Michael
Schwerner
,
played
by
Geoffrey
Nauffts
;
"
Passenger
"
,
based
on
Andrew
Goodman
,
played
by
Rick
Zieff
;
and
"
Black
Passenger
"
,
based
on
James
Chaney
,
played
by
Christopher
White
.

The
film
presents
Clinton
Pell
's
wife
as
the
informant
.

The
identity
of
the
real
informant
,
known
in
history
as
"
Mr.
X.
"
,
was
a
closely
held
secret
for
forty
years
.

In
the
process
of
reopening
the
case
,
journalist
Jerry
Mitchell
and
teacher
Barry
Bradford
discovered
his
real
name
.

The
mysterious
black
associate
of
Rupert
Anderson
who
threatens
to
castrate
the
mayor
while
he
is
bound
to
the
chair
is
based
on
Colombo
crime
family
capo
and
FBI
informant
Gregory
Scarpa
Sr.
The
character
"
Frank
Bailey
"
,
played
by
Michael
Rooker
,
is
based
on
Alton
Wayne
Roberts
,
Stephen
Tobolowsky
as
"
Clayton
Townley
"
based
on
Samuel
Bowers
and
Pruitt
Taylor
Vince
as
"
Lester
Cowens
"
based
on
Edgar
Ray
Killen
.

According
to
the
testimony
of
Colombo
crime
family
contract
killer
Gregory
S.
Scarpa
Jr.
,
the
cinematic
version
may
have
come
closer
to
the
truth
than
the
official
FBI
story
out
of
Washington
,
D.C.
His
story
has
been
supported
in
several
news
accounts
by
unnamed
FBI
agents
purported
to
have
worked
on
the
MIBURN
case
,
as
well
as
Scarpa
's
own
FD-000
reports
,
which
were
released
and
made
public
after
his
death
.

Scarpa
has
said
that
his
father
,
Gregory
Scarpa
Sr.
,
capo
of
the
Colombo
crime
family
and
Top
Echelon
FBI
informant
,
offered
his
services
in
the
case
to
his
FBI
handler
,
Anthony
Villano
.

He
made
a
three-day
trip
to
Mississippi
where
,
posing
as
a
member
of
the
national
Ku
Klux
Klan
himself
,
he
and
an
FBI
helper
kidnapped
a
local
appliance
salesman
and
Ku
Klux
Klan
member
who
was
viewed
by
the
FBI
as
a
potential
weak
link
in
the
case
.

They
took
the
man
to
a
remote
location
,
tied
him
to
a
chair
,
and
interrogated
him
.

The
first
two
times
he
told
the
story
,
the
agent
and
Scarpa
believed
that
the
man
was
lying
.

On
the
third
try
,
Scarpa
pulled
his
gun
on
the
suspect
.
"

He
said
he
took
a
gun
and
put
it
in
the
guy
's
mouth
and
said
:
For
the
last
time
,
where
are
the
bodies
or
I
'll
blow
your
head
off
"
,
Gregory
S.
Scarpa
Jr.
testified
.

Events
similar
to
Scarpa
Jr.
's
story
are
reenacted
in
the
film
.

The
KKK
member
finally
confessed
to
the
location
of
the
bodies
,
Scarpa
Jr.
said
.

One
such
report
,
written
in
January
0000
,
states
that
Scarpa
was
later
used
as
a
"
special
"
—
the
FBI
term
for
a
nonagent
working
for
the
Bureau
in
the
murder
of
Vernon
Dahmer
,
the
head
of
the
NAACP
office
in
Hattiesburg
,
Mississippi
.

Dahmer
's
house
was
torched
by
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
,
and
the
memo
states
that
Scarpa
Sr.
was
sent
to
Hattiesburg
to
work
on
the
case
.

However
,
evidence
from
journalist
Jerry
Mitchell
and
Illinois
high
school
teacher
Barry
Bradford
contradicts
this
account
.

They
claim
that
the
informant
who
revealed
the
location
of
the
bodies
was
highway
patrolman
Maynard
King
,
who
gave
the
information
willingly
to
FBI
agent
Joseph
Sullivan
.

The
similarity
between
Scarpa
's
account
and
the
film
may
be
best
explained
by
the
fact
that
Scarpa
's
testimony
was
recorded
some
years
after
the
film
was
released
.

Both
the
Justice
Department
and
the
FBI
have
officially
declined
to
comment
on
any
role
Gregory
Scarpa
Sr.
may
have
played
in
the
MIBURN
.

In
Cartha
DeLoach
's
account
of
the
MIBURN
case
in
his
memoir
,
Hoover
's
FBI
,
he
does
not
mention
Scarpa
.

It
does
say
that
a
squad
of
COINTELPRO
agents
were
sent
to
interview
members
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
and
that
"
many
of
them
were
big
,
bruising
men
,
highly
trained
in
the
tactics
of
interrogation
.
"

Cartha
"
Deke
"
DeLoach
's
official
version
is
that
the
FBI
paid
for
its
first
big
break
in
the
case
,
which
was
the
location
of
the
bodies
.

In
his
memoirs
,
he
describes
the
men
only
as
"
a
minister
and
a
member
of
the
highway
patrol
.
"

DeLoach
does
not
say
how
the
two
men
knew
that
the
three
civil
rights
workers
had
been
buried
under
twelve
feet
of
dirt
in
an
earthen
dam
on
a
large
farm
a
few
miles
outside
Philadelphia
,
Mississippi
,
but
he
did
say
that
the
FBI
paid
$
00,000
for
the
piece
of
crucial
information
.

The
statement
made
by
"
Mayor
Tilman
"
to
the
FBI
agents
is
paraphrased
from
a
quote
by
U.S.
Senator
James
Eastland
,
who
reportedly
said
that
when
the
three
civil
rights
workers
(
Mickey
Schwerner
,
James
Chaney
,
and
Andrew
Goodman
)
went
missing
in
Mississippi
on
June
00
,
0000
,
"
the
incident
is
a
hoax
and
there
is
no
Ku
Klux
Klan
in
the
state
;
the
three
have
gone
to
Chicago
"
,
and
that
it
was
staged
by
the
three
young
men
to
call
attention
to
their
cause
.

J.
Edgar
Hoover
,
who
was
being
pressured
by
President
Lyndon
B.
Johnson
,
was
determined
to
break
the
case
.

He
flew
to
Mississippi
just
before
the
first
anniversary
of
the
disappearance
,
which
was
officially
regarded
as
a
"
kidnapping
"
to
justify
the
FBI
's
involvement
.

The
film
has
been
criticized
by
many
for
its
fictionalization
of
history
.

In
an
often-quoted
review
in
Time
Magazine
,
Jack
E.
White
referred
to
the
film
as
a
"
cinematic
lynching
of
the
truth
"
.

Parker
defended
his
film
by
reminding
critics
that
it
was
a
dramatization
,
not
a
documentary
.

It
was
also
criticized
for
its
portrayal
of
southern
African
Americans
as
passive
victims
,
which
also
shapes
the
film
's
reenactment
of
the
assassinations
.

Wisconsin
v.
Mitchell
The
film
itself
shaped
history
when
,
on
October
0
,
0000
,
a
group
of
African
Americans
became
enraged
after
drinking
and
discussing
the
film
,
particularly
the
scene
in
which
a
white
man
beat
a
young
black
boy
who
was
praying
,
and
one
of
the
group
incited
the
others
to
beat
up
a
passing
00-year-old
white
boy
based
on
his
skin
color
.

The
ensuing
court
case
Wisconsin
v.
Mitchell
(

)
was
not
only
one
of
the
few
high-profile
cases
about
a
hate
crime
perpetrated
by
African
Americans
against
whites
but
also
led
to
a
landmark
decision
of
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
ruling
that
a
state
may
consider
whether
a
crime
was
committed
or
initially
considered
due
to
an
intended
victim
's
status
in
a

class

The
case
became
thereby
an
important

History
McClure
owes
its
stock
of
fine
homes
dating
from
the
late
00th
century
and
early
00th
century
to
the
growth
of
rail
lines
throughout
Northwestern
Ohio
in
those
days
.

As
it
did
for
its
neighbors
,
Grelton
,
Malinta
,
Hamler
,
Deshler
,
Holgate
,
Liberty
Center
,
and
Grand
Rapids
,
the
railroad
brought
McClure
a
means
for
farmers
to
get
their
goods
to
market
.

And
while
farmers
were
in
town
,
they
could
patronize
local
businesses
which
sold
items
brought
in
by
rail
.

The
McClure
Telephone
Company
,
which
dates
back
to
the
first
days
of
telephone
service
in
Henry
County
,
in
the
0000s
,
was
established
during
that
boom
time
.

For
years
it
was
a
typical
telephone
company
,
but
by
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
it
was
becoming
an
example
of
a
bygone
era
.

McClure
residents
had
the
distinction
of
living
in
the
last
Ohio
town
to
have
had
a
manual
telephone
system
.

For
nearly
one
hundred
years
,
residents
used
the
same
method
to
signal
their
town
's
operator
;
they
turned
a
crank
and
the
operator
answered
,
who
in
most
cases
knew
their
voice
or
knew
the
person
being
called
.

They
had
phone
numbers
,
like
0
,
or
000
,
or
00
.

But
when
the
operator
knows
everyone
in
town
,
most
people
rarely
used
their
numbers
.

When
people
wanted
to
talk
to
someone
in
the
outside
world
,
the
would
ask
the
operator
for
the
number
,
and
she
'd
connect
them
to
the
long-distance
operator
in
Bowling
Green
,
who
would
complete
the
call
.

They
also
had
a
trunk
line
to
Napeoleon
,
which
could
be
used
if
they
were
calling
numbers
in
that
area
.

Residents
in
some
nearby
towns
for
whom
McClure
was
a
local
call
could
dial
a
single
digit
(
a
0
or
0
for
example
)
and
reach
the
McClure
operator
,
who
could
complete
a
call
to
McClure
for
them
.

McClure
converted
in
0000
to
an
electronic
switching
system
with
all
touch-tone
phones
.

The
customers
found
themselves
getting
used
to
the
new
and
impersonal
equipment
,
and
looking
up
numbers
in
phone
books
.

After
years
of
party
lines
,
they
were
enjoying
having
private
lines
.

While
the
phone
company
remains
in
McClure
and
has
yet
to
be
consolidated
into
a
larger
telecom
company
,
today
most
of
McClure
's
businesses
are
long
closed
,
as
are
those
in
most
of
the
boom
towns
which
grew
up
in
the
same
era
as
McClure
.

Today
a
McClure
resident
would
be
likely
to
drive
to
Napoleon
or
Bowling
Green
to
go
shopping
,
or
possibly
to
Toledo
.

The
rail
lines
which
brought
so
much
money
into
the
area
are
abandoned
.

n't
well
received

tidbit
,
he
hops
off

and
Tess
.

then
convince
Trask

the
move
into

was
Tess
's
idea
,
showing
him
materials
.

Trask
confronts
Katharine
,
asking

she
came
up
with
the
idea

and
is
fired

reveals
she
is
,
in

,
Tess
’s
secretary
.

Tess
insists
they
work
together
as
colleagues
,
showing
she
will
be
very
different
than
Katharine
.

She
then
calls
Cynthia
from
her

Janet

,
in

review

Times
,
wrote
,
"
Mike
Nichols
,
who
directed
Working
Girl
,
also
displays
an
uncharacteristically
blunt
touch
,
and
in
its

stages
the
story
remains
lively
but
seldom
has
the
perceptiveness
or
acuity
of
Mr.
Nichols
's
best
work
"
.

In
his
review
for
Time
,
Richard
Corliss
wrote
,
"
Kevin
Wade
shows
this
in
his
smart
screenplay
,
which
is
full
of
the
atmospheric
pressures
that
allow
stars
to
collide
.

Director
Mike
Nichols
knows
this
in
his
bones
.

He
encourages
Weaver
to
play
(
brilliantly
)
an
airy
shrew
.

He
gives
Ford
a
boyish
buoyancy
and
Griffith
the
chance
to
be

History
Laurelville
was
laid
out
in
0000
by
John
and
W.S.
Albin
,
Soloman
Riegel
and
Rufus
Dodson
.

The
name
probably
comes
from
the
stream
,
"
Laurel
Creek
"
which
flows
through
the
village
.

Laurel
is
an
evergreen
shrub
which
grows
profusely
along
the
cliffs
of
the
winding
stream
from
its
origin
to
the
point
where
it
joins
Saltcreek
,
thus
giving
the
stream
its
name
.

It
is
quite
likely
that
the
location
of
Laurelville
near
where
Laurel
joins
Saltcreek
was
influenced
by
the
potential
water
power
that
these
two
streams
provided
.

Water
power
was
used
soon
after
the
town
was
laid
out
to
provide
power
for
a
saw
mill
and
a
grain
mill
which
were
the
first
business
locations
located
in
the
new
village
.

The
water
from
Laurel
Creek
was
diverted
,
or
at
least
a
portion
of
it
,
into
a
small
lake
or
pond
which
served
as
a
resivoir
for
a
constant
supply
of
water
for
a
mill
race
which
followed
course
directly
past
the
saw
mill
then
past
the
grain
mill
and
returned
to
the
stream
approximately
0/0
mile
from
its
origin
.

Saltcreet
was
also
dammed
on
the
west
side
of
Laurelville
,
out
of
town
,
and
over
in
Pickaway
County
to
provide
for
mills
over
there
.

Before
0000
ended
,
three
houses
had
been
erected
in
the
new
settlement
and
plans
for
others
had
been
made
.

Each
year
following
0000
,
more
dwellings
were
added
along
with
business
places
to
keep
pace
with
the
growth
in
population
.

Soon
,
new
land
was
plotted
for
additional
residences
and
shops
to
provide
for
the
growing
needs
and
for
products
and
services
demanded
by
this
new
community
.

The
fertile
soil
on
every
side
of
Laurelville
attracted
settlers
from
other
parts
of
Ohio
and
from
states
east
of
Ohio
.

By
the
turn
of
the
century
,
Laurelville
was
listed
with
those
pioneer
towns
that
proudly
claimed
a
population
of
over
000
persons
.

It
was
incorporated
,
with
a
mayor
and
other
town
officials
,
and
had
made
improvements
like
good
streets
,
sidewalks
,
shade
trees
,
and
other
facilities
to
enhance
their
neat
and
well-kept
homes
.

Residents
of
the
town
were
rightfully
proud
of
their
progress
and
did
what
they
could
to
make
their
town
attractive
,
clean
and
convenient
.

for
a
Fire
Department
were
made
and
they
organized
a
group
of
men
into
an
effective
and
efficient
bucket
brigade
who
answered
the
fire
alarm
any
time
day
or
night
.

The
organization
of
fire
fighters
started
on
July
0
,
0000
after
the
Village
Council
passed
an
ordinance
creating
the
Volunteer
Fire
Company
and
was
the
forerunner
of
the
present-day
modern
Volunteer
Fire
Department
.

For
many
years
the
department
furnished
fire
protection
to
Benton
,
Saltcreek
,
Perry
townships
and
the
Village
of
Laurelville
with
one
station
and
about
twenty-five
members
.

This
meant
giving
fire
protection
to
0000
people
scattered
over
000
square
mile
area
.

In
December
0000
another
00
square
miles
was
added
to
our
fire
protection
area
when
we
contracted
to
protect
Eagle
Twp
.

This
area
borders
the
southern
boundary
of
Saltcreek
Twp
.

The
people
of
Laurelville
take
great
pride
in
their
Volunteer
Fire
Department
and
the
town
celebrates
with
an
annual
festival
hosted
by
the
Fire
Department
every
year
in
July
.

Laureville
was
strategically
located
equi-distance
between
larger
towns
such
Logan
,
Chillicothe
,
Lancaster
and
Circleville
.

The
pioneer
planners
of
the
Village
were
aware
of
the
importance
of
factors
that
would
contribute
to
the
success
of
the
new
Village
.

Improved
highways
leading
into
these
larger
towns
and
cities
not
only
provided
business
for
the
cities
but
gave
this
area
an
outlet
for
its
marketable
products
and
added
much
to
the
local
economy
.

In
0000
,
the
Columbus
and
Southern
Railroad
began
to
operate
between
Wyandotte
Junction
,
a
connection
with
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
line
,
in
Fairfield
County
,
and
the
coal
mines
in
Hocking
,
Vinton
and
Athens
Counties
.

The
line
actually
operated
between
South
Bloomingville
and
the
junction
and
ran
through
Laurelville
daily
.

This
railroad
line
,
although
plagued
with
poor
equipment
and
financial
problems
,
was
a
boon
to
business
in
this
pioneer
community
.

The
success
of
the
railroad
was
dependent
upon
coal
and
that
success
never
was
realized
,
as
the
rugged
terrain
in
the
area
of
Ash
Cave
,
along
the
right-of-way
,
proved
to
be
too
much
of
a
barrier
to
overcome
.

The
train
never
ran
further
east
than
South
Bloomingville
.

It
did
operate
,
on
a
limited
basis
,
until
0000
.

After
the
railroad
failure
,
public
highways
grew
in
importance
in
the
area
,
and
the
infant
automobile
and
truck
business
became
more
and
more
important
with
each
successive
year
.

Farming
and
industry
prospered
and
the
area
population
increased
both
in
the
Village
and
in
the
countryside
.

The
natives
not
only
demanded
better
and
better
highways
,
they
also
wanted
larger
and
better
schools
and
churches
as
well
.

The
first
school
in
Laurelville
was
a
one
room
structure
,
then
other
rooms
were
added
as
they
were
needed
along
with
other
improvements
.

The
schools
were
organized
on
a
Township
basis
,
with
a
Board
of
Education
to
administer
local
schools
and
a
County
Board
of
Education
to
tie
all
Township
Schools
together
under
a
County
Superintendent
of
Schools
;
so
there
would
be
equality
in
terms
of
curriculum
and
other
matters
.

In
later
years
,
the
State
organized
the
schools
into
larger
and
larger
units
and
in
the
0000s
,
Laurelville
School
became
part
of
the
Logan
Elm
School
District
of
Pickaway
County
with
an
Elementary
School
located
in
the
Village
.

The
Junior
and
Senior
High
School
students
are
transported
to
the
Logan
Elm
High
School
,
located
five
miles
east
of
Circleville
.

All
through
history
,
physicians
have
been
important
to
the
welfare
of
every
community
.

Doctors
in
this
area
contributed
so
much
that
we
can
not
exaggerate
their
services
.

They
called
on
patients
day
and
night
,
and
before
automobiles
were
in
use
,
they
traveled
on
horseback
or
in
horse
drawn
vehicles
.

In
the
Village
,
they
traveled
on
foot
from
house
to
house
.

In
the
winter
and
during
epidemics
they
could
not
get
to
all
who
needed
them
.

It
is
true
that
such
diesases
that
formerly
used
so
much
of
the
doctors
'
time
and
caused
so
much
suffering
to
the
afflicted
are
now
less
prevalent
today
than
they
were
.

Diseases
such
as
malaria
,
typhoid
fever
,
tetanus
,
polio
,
scarlet
fever
and
diphtheria
were
more
common
in
the
early
days
of
the
Village
.

Doctors
who
served
this
area
with
distinction
and
dedication
are
:
Doctors
Cain
,
Simkins
,
Hemminger
,
Barton
,
Melcher
,
Palmer
,
Watson
,
Floyd
and
Grattidge
.

Laurelville
has
often
been
plagued
by
flooding
.

The
streams
that
were
considered
an
asset
when
the
Village
was
founded
also
were
responsible
for
damages
from
time
to
time
when
excessive
rains
caused
them
to
overflow
their
banks
.

Some
years
,
naturally
,
were
worse
than
others
.

The
years
of
0000
,
0000
,
and
again
in
0000
were
extremely
bad
years
for
floods
in
this
area
.

The
citizens
realizing
that
the
flooding
problem
would
not
cease
but
would
probably
become
even
more
serious
with
passing
years
and
increased
development
,
set
out
to
construct
a
levee
and
to
raise
the
houses
and
places
of
business
to
lessen
the
damage
and
infrequence
of
the
floods
.

The
streams
were
dredged
,
their
courses
were
altered
somewhat
but
the
problem
although
relieved
,
was
not
totally
eliminated
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
at
approximately
0:00
A.M.
Laurelville
suffered
its
greatest
flood
.

The
levee
broke
and
a
wall
of
water
0
to
00
feet
high
descended
upon
the
Village
.

In
a
short
period
of
a
few
minutes
,
half
of
the
homes
and
nearly
all
of
the
businesses
were
flooded
.

The
impact
of
this
flood
was
a
tremendous
blow
to
all
of
the
citizens
whose
homes
or
businesses
were
affected
.

Mobile
homes
washed
away
or
were
broken
up
and
destroyed
.

Cars
were
flooded
and
many
washed
downstream
and
permanent
homes
were
washed
off
of
their
foundations
.

Bridges
collapsed
and
fell
into
the
stream
or
were
damaged
almost
beyond
repair
and
hundreds
of
tons
of
mud
and
debris
were
dumped
into
the
streets
,
lawns
,
homes
and
businesses
of
this
quiet
little
Village
.

Within
a
few
hours
after
the
flood
struck
,
the
people
gathered
to
discuss
the
disaster
that
struck
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.

They
organized
and
went
to
work
to
restore
Laurelville
to
what
it
had
been
before
the
flood
.

The
State
Agencies
such
as
Civil
Defense
,
The
National
Guard
and
the
Red
Cross
came
in
with
equipment
and
personnel
,
along
with
church
groups
and
other
civic
organizations
.

With
the
work
of
hundreds
of
friends
and
relatives
,
Laurelville
was
restored
.

Logan
is
a
city
in
Hocking
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Hocking
County
.

Logan
is
located
in
southeast
Ohio
,
on
the
Hocking
River
southeast
of
Columbus
.

The
current
mayor
of
Logan
is
Republican
Martin
Irvine
,
who
began
a
four-year
term
in
January
0000
.

History
Logan
is
the
county
seat
of
Hocking
County
,
Ohio
.

Residents
named
the
town
in
honor
of
Chief
Logan
of
the
Mingo
Indian
tribe
.

Ohio
Governor
Thomas
Worthington
established
the
community
in
0000
.

According
to
the
Ohio
Historical
Society
,
Logan
had
about
000
residents
in
0000
,
and
000
by
0000
.

The
Hocking
River
provided
sufficient
water
power
for
the
purpose
of
operating
grist
and
sawmills
particularly
at
the
falls
above
Logan
.

The
town
of
Logan
was
slow
to
progress
until
the
opening
of
the
Hocking
Canal
,
a
branch
of
the
Ohio
and
Erie
Canal
,
in
0000
.

Several
industries
prospered
due
to
the
rich
mineral
resources
of
the
Hocking
Valley
.

The
discovery
of
immense
quantities
of
coal
led
to
the
flourishing
mining
industry
.

Towns
appeared
and
vanished
as
quickly
as
mines
opened
and
closed
.

It
was
soon
found
that
iron
ore
could
be
extracted
from
the
sandstone
bedrock
of
the
area
.

At
its
height
during
the
Civil
War
,
Ohio
was
the
leading
producer
of
iron
for
implements
and
weapons
.

No
less
than
forty-six
furnaces
were
firing
in
southern
Ohio
's
six-county
Hanging
Rock
Iron
Region
,
and
by
summer
0000
up
to
sixty
furnaces
were
counted
.

The
clay
soils
of
the
Hocking
Valley
helped
Ohio
become
a
leader
in
clay
products
.

The
firebrick
industry
of
the
valley
manufactured
such
products
as
clay
tile
,
building
and
paving
bricks
and
clay
sewer
pipe
.

Evidence
of
the
industry
can
be
seen
in
the
many
brick
houses
and
abandoned
kilns
of
the
area
.

Clay
is
still
an
important
industry
in
the
region
.

In
the
town
's
early
history
,
many
manufacturers
were
established
in
the
community
.

In
the
early
years
,
the
two
largest
employers
were
the
Motherwell
Iron
and
Steel
Company
and
the
railroad
.

In
more
recent
history
,
prominent
industrial
names
in
Logan
have
included
Goodyear
Tire
and
Rubber
Company
,
Selkirk

Today
,
many
residents
of
Logan
and
the
surrounding
area
work
in
the
tourism
sector
.

Numerous
residents
operate
bed
and
breakfasts
or
work
in
hotels
or
restaurants
to
meet
the
needs
of
tourists
visiting
the
Hocking
Hills
State
Park
.

Many
natural
wonders
exist
in
the
area
immediately
surrounding
Logan
.

Driving
Miss
Daisy
is
a
0000
American
comedy-drama
film
adapted
from
the
Alfred
Uhry
play
of
the
same
name
.

The
film
was
directed
by
Bruce
Beresford
,
with
Morgan
Freeman
reprising
his
role
as
Hoke
Colburn
and
Jessica
Tandy
playing
Miss
Daisy
.

The
story
defines
Daisy
and
her
point
of
view
through
a
network
of
relationships
and
emotions
by
focusing
on
her
home
life
,
synagogue
,
friends
,
family
,
fears
,
and
concerns
over
a
00-year
period
.

Plot
Mrs.
(
"
Miss
"
)
Daisy
Werthan
(
Jessica
Tandy
)
,
a
00-year-old
wealthy
white
Jewish
widowed
school
teacher
,
lives
in
Atlanta
,
Georgia
,
alone
except
for
an
African
American
housemaid
named
Idella
(
Esther
Rolle
)
.

In
0000
,
after
a
driving
mishap
where
her
automobile
is
wrecked
,
Miss
Daisy
’s
son
,
Boolie
(
Dan
Aykroyd
)
,
tells
her
she
will
have
to
get
a
chauffeur
because
no
insurance
company
will
cover
her
.

She
refuses
,
but
Boolie
is
determined
to
find
her
a
driver
.

Meanwhile
,
she
is
stuck
at
home
and
unable
to
run
errands
.

Boolie
finds
Hoke
Coleburn
(
Morgan
Freeman
)
,
who
had
chauffeured
for
a
local
judge
until
he
died
and
decided
to
remain
in
the
area
rather
than
accompany
the
judge
's
widow
when
she
moved
away
.

Miss
Daisy
at
first
refuses
to
let
Hoke
drive
her
,
going
so
far
as
to
walk
to
the
local
Piggly
Wiggly
with
Hoke
following
her
by
automobile
,
much
to
her
chagrin
.

It
is
revealed
that
her
reluctance
to
be
driven
around
is
because
she
is
embarrassed
that
people
might
think
she
is
either
too
elderly
to
drive
,
or
so
well
off
that
she
can
pay
for
a
driver
.

Out
of
necessity
,
Miss
Daisy
gradually
starts
to
accept
Hoke
and
the
fact
that
she
needs
him
to
drive
her
around
.

She
eventually
comes
to
respect
him
.

Later
,
Miss
Daisy
finds
out
that
Hoke
is
illiterate
and
teaches
him
how
to
read
.

Miss
Daisy
has
Hoke
drive
her
to
her
brother
's
00th
birthday
party
in
Mobile
,
Alabama
.

During
the
trip
,
Hoke
reveals
that
it
is
the
first
time
he
has
left
his
home
state
of
Georgia
.

Miss
Daisy
realizes
that
Hoke
's
race
affects
how
others
treat
him
in
this
society
and
she
is
further
opened
to
the
social
aspects
of
discrimination
.

As
Miss
Daisy
and
Hoke
spend
time
together
,
she
gains
appreciation
for
his
many
skills
and
the
two
become
friends
.

Boolie
is
also
appreciative
,
and
Hoke
shrewdly
negotiates
salary
increases
from
him
,
which
enables
him
to
buy
Miss
Daisy
's
old
trade-in
's
for
himself
each
time
Daisy
gets
a
new
car
.

The
racism
and
prejudice
that
permeated
American
society
during
the
time
period
in
which
the
story
takes
place
is
explored
in
the
film
,
especially
when
Hoke
is
questioned
by
a
pair
of
Alabama
highway
patrolmen
who
make
out-of-earshot
bigoted
comments
about
Miss
Daisy
being
Jewish
and
Hoke
being
black
.

Idella
,
who
had
served
Miss
Daisy
for
many
years
and
whom
Miss
Daisy
was
very
close
to
emotionally
,
suddenly
dies
in
0000
.

Miss
Daisy
,
Boolie
,
his
wife
Florine
(
Patti
LuPone
)
,
and
Hoke
attend
the
funeral
.

Rather
than
hire
a
new
maid
,
Miss
Daisy
mostly
takes
it
upon
herself
to
care
for
her
house
and
cook
her
meals
.

Hoke
assists
with
cooking
and
the
two
plant
a
vegetable
garden
(
which
Daisy
initially
did
n't
want
out
of
spite
earlier
during
Hoke
's
tenure
)
.

After
her
synagogue
is
bombed
,
Miss
Daisy
realizes
that
she
is
subject
to
some
of
the
same
prejudices
as
Hoke
.

But
in
the
course
of
the
movie
,
American
society
undergoes
radical
changes
,
and
Miss
Daisy
soon
attends
a
dinner
at
which
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
gives
a
speech
.

She
initially
invites
Boolie
to
the
dinner
,
but
he
declines
,
and
suggests
that
Miss
Daisy
invite
Hoke
.

However
,
Miss
Daisy
only
asks
him
to
be
her
guest
during
the
car
ride
to
the
event
and
ends
up
attending
the
dinner
alone
,
with
Hoke
insulted
by
the
manner
of
the
invitation
,
listening
to
the
speech
on
the
car
radio
outside
.

One
morning
in
0000
,
Hoke
arrives
at
the
house
and
finds
Miss
Daisy
in
a
confused
state
,
with
signs
of
dementia
.

Hoke
manages
to
calm
her
down
and
Miss
Daisy
confesses
to
Hoke
that
he
is
her
best
friend
.

After
a
discussion
with
Hoke
,
Boolie
arranges
for
Miss
Daisy
to
enter
a
retirement
home
since
she
is
no
longer
able
to
live
on
her
own
.

In
0000
,
the
family
home
is
sold
,
and
Hoke
,
now
00
,
retires
.

Hoke
is
driven
to
Miss
Daisy
's
house
by
his
adult
granddaughter
where
he
meets
Boolie
.

Boolie
and
Hoke
meet
at
Miss
Daisy
's
house
one
final
time
before
the
new
owner
takes
possession
,
and
then
drive
to
the
retirement
home
to
visit
Miss
Daisy
,
who
is
now
00
.

Boolie
leaves
Hoke
and
Miss
Daisy
alone
so
they
can
spend
time
together
.

Hoke
shows
Miss
Daisy
her
uneaten
pumpkin
pie
.

She
has
difficulty
moving
her
fork
and
Hoke
feeds
her
instead
.

As
Hoke
feeds
Miss
Daisy
,
he
reminisces
upon
all
the
years
he
spent
driving
her
,
and
the
image
of
a
car
drives
off
into
the
distance
.

The

motto
,

"
was
chosen
in

late

by
former

.

New

has

by

.

Geography
New

is
located
at
(

-00.000000
)
.

According

,
the

has
a
total

of
,
of

,
is

New

is
bound
to
the
north
,
west
,
and
east
by
New
London
Township
,
and
to
the
south
by
Ruggles
Township
in
Ashland
County
.

The
village
is
located
00
miles
south
of
Lake
Erie
.

Cultural
geography
New
London
is
thoroughly
Midwestern
,
and
the
village
's
economy
is
closely
tied
to
agriculture
and
manufacturing
.

Although
well
within
the
Great
Lakes
region
(
a
sub
region
of
the
Midwest
)
and
arguably
located
at
the
center
of
the
Rust
Belt
,
significant
influences
from
New
England
and
the
South
have
contributed
to
New
London
's
cultural
identity
.

The
village
was
founded
by
settlers
from
Connecticut
(
and
to
a
lesser
extent
other
parts
of
the
Northeast
)
along
with
neighboring
communities
in
the
Firelands
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
.

The
village
's
New
England
heritage
is
most
evident
in
its
architecture
,
the
names
of
local
families
,
and
the
presence
of
a
village
green
(
a
common
characteristic
of
many
cities
and
towns
in
Northern
Ohio
)
.

In
the
mid
twentieth
century
at
the
climax
of
the
manufacturing
boom
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
,
New
London
welcomed
an
influx
of
new
residents
from
the
Appalachian
South
-
primarily
Eastern
Kentucky
-
to
work
in
fields
and
factories
locally
and
in
nearby
metropolitan
Cleveland
.

Today
,
the
influence
of
these
Southerners
is
most
evident
in
the
hospitality
and
kindness
of
New
London
's
residents
,
and
the
close-knit
community
that
has
grown
up
in
the
midst
of
such
diversity
.

one
for

from
cities
in

that

History
On

00
,
0000
,
Norwalk
,
Connecticut
,
was
burned
by
the
British
Tories
under
Governor
Tryon
.

A
committee
of
the
General
Assembly
estimated
the
losses
to
the
inhabitants
at
$
000,000.00
.

Later
,
the
federal
government
gave
an
area
in
the
Western
Reserve
of
Ohio
as
compensation
for
those
established
losses
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the

States
ceded
the
land
titles
to
the
"
fire
sufferers
"
and
the
representatives
of
the
Reserve
transferred
the
political
jurisdiction
to
the
general
government
.

The
Indian
title
was
extinguished
by
treaty
on
July
0
,
0000
,
on
payment
of
$
00,000.00
;
and

,
a
group
of

,
and

of
Directors
of
the
Proprietors
of
the
of
land
lying
south

Erie
,
called
the
"
Sufferers
Land
"

s
in
this
area
known
as
the
"
Firelands
of
Ohio
"
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
many
families
made

to
look
over
land
they
had
purchased
in
the
"
Firelands
"
.

During

and
purchased
of
land
with
an
eye
toward
establishing
a
town
.

In
July
0000
,
Benedict
returned
to
Norwalk
with
his
family
and
immediately
built
a
house
.

This
was
the
first
permanent
residence
established
within
the
limits
of
Norwalk
Village
.

In
May
0000
,
the
county
seat
was
successfully
removed
from
Avery
,
Ohio
,
to
Norwalk
,
and
by
0000
a
census
showed
a
population
of
000
residents
.

Platt
Benedict
,
the
founder
of
Norwalk
and
its
first
mayor
,
died
in
0000
at
the
age
of
00
.

He

Cemetery

History
The
original
name
of
Willard
was
Chicago
,
named
for
the
junction
of
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
's
line
to
Sandusky
(
the
Sandusky
,
Mansfield
and
Newark
Railroad
)
and
the
branch
west
to
Chicago
(
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
and
Chicago
Railroad
)
.

Later
the
Akron
and
Chicago
Junction
Railroad
was
built
east
from
the
junction
,
providing
a
more
direct
route
between
the
Northeast
and
Chicago
.

With
the
name
of
Chicago
passengers
would
mistake
it
for
Chicago
,
Ill
,
so
they
changed
the
name
to
Chicago
Junction
,
but
the
word
Junction
did
not
fit
on
boards
at
the
time
so
it
did
not
fix
the
problem
.

In
0000
,
to
finally
rectify
the
confusion
,
the
town
changed
its
name
to
Willard
,
after
the
then
president
of
the
B&O
,
Daniel
Willard
.

Economy
Several
key
businesses
have
a
presence
in
Willard
,
they
include
:
the
Willard
rail
yard
of
CSX
Transportation
,
Midwest
Industries
,
RR
Donnelley
,
Pepperidge
Farm
,
and
Mercy
Willard
Hospital
.

primary
crops
being
corn
,
soybeans
,
wheat
,
onions

reduce
their
workforce
in

to
become
more
efficient
and
competitive
against
other

Government
City
Officials
Politics
The
current
political
make-up
of
Steubenville
is
largely
Democratic
and
an
above-average
number
of
registered
Independents
.

There
are
six
Democrats
for
every
one
Republican

.

The
City
of
Steubenville
is
part

Congressional
district
of

longest
US
House
district
in
Ohio
and
runs
along
the
southeast
state
borders
of
Ohio
.

Political
corruption
Steubenville
has
had
a
reputation
for
political
corruption
.

The
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
alleged
that
the
city
and
police
force
had
subjected
numerous
individuals
to
"
excessive
force
,
false
arrests
,
charges
,
and
reports
"
and
had
engaged
in
practices
regarding
"
improper
stops
,
searches
,
and
seizures
.
"

The
report
from
the
Department
also
stated
that
excessive
force
was
levied
against
individuals
who
witnessed
incidents
of
police
misconduct
,
and
against
those
who
were
known
critics
of
the
city
and
its
police
force
.

Those
individuals
were
also
falsely
detained
if
the
city
and
the
police
agreed
that
they
were
"
likely
to
complain
of
abuse
.
"

It
also
stated
that
the
officers
involved
also
falsified
reports
and
tampered
with
official
police
recorders
so
that
"
misconduct
would
not
be
recorded
.
"

Over
a
period
of
00
years
the
city
lost
,
or
settled
out
of
court
,
00
civil
rights
lawsuits
involving
its
police
force
.

The
city
paid
out
more
than
$
000,000
,
$
000,000
of
which
was
between
0000
and
0000
.

As
a
result
,
the
city
's
police
force
became
the
second
city
in
the
United
States
to
sign
a
consent
decree
with
the
federal
government
due
to
an
excessive
number
of
civil
rights
lawsuits
.

The
decree
was
signed
on
September
0
,
0000
under
the
"
pattern
or
practice
"
provision
.

Under
this
agreement
,
the
city
agreed
to
improve
the
training
of
its
police
officers
,
implement
new
guidelines
and
procedures
,
establish
an
internal
affairs
unit
,
and
establish
an
"
early
warning
system
.
"

Speed
cameras
The
speed
camera
program
began
in
0000
and
earned
the
city
$
000,000
in
revenues
,
as
nearly
0,000
tickets
at
$
00
each
were
issued
during
that
time
period
.

In
March
0000
,
the
Jefferson
County
Court
of
Common
Pleas
ruled
that
the
city
ordinance
of
supporting
the
speed
camera
program
was
illegal
and
unconstitutional
.

The
city
refused
to
remove
the
cameras
,
however
,
because
it
stated
it
was
"
bound
by
contract
to
continue
the
services
"
of
Traffipax
,
Inc.
,
the
US
subsidiary
of
ROBOT
Visual
Systems
,
a
German
corporation
.

Despite
attempts
to
remove
the
cameras
,
the
city
continued
to
defy
the
judge
's
order
and
reinstated
an
identical
ordinance
to
continue
issuing
citations
.

Councilman
at
Large
Michael
Hernon
cast
the
sole
dissenting
vote
against
reinstating
the
traffic
cameras
.

In
mid-0000
,
an
attorney
filed
a
class-action
lawsuit
against
the
city
of
Steubenville
for
illegally
collecting
fines
and
generating
unnecessary
revenue
from
motorists
.

He
won
the
case
in
December
0000
and
the
city
was
forced
to
refund
thousands
of
tickets
totaling
$
000,000
.

Stern
also
gathered
enough
signatures
from
the
residents
of
the
city
to
put
forth
a
referendum
that
posed
the
question
of
whether
the
city
's
ordinance
authorizing
the
speed
camera
program
should
continue
.

On
November
0
,
0000
,
city
residents
voted
to
end
the
city
's
speed
camera
program
with
a
00.0
percent
majority
.

the
Steubenville

convicted
of
raping
a

girl
at
a
series
of
parties
on
August
00
,
0000
.

The
case
drew
international
attention
as
speculation
grew
that
police
covered
up
the
incident
to
protect
the
football
players
.

Text
messages
revealed
that
the
football
coach
,
Reno
Saccoccia
,
may
have
been
covering
for
Mays

revealed
texts

that
stated
that
the
football
coach
"
was
joking
about
it
so
I
'm
really
not
worried
"
,
and
that
he
had
gotten
Saccoccia
to
,
"
take
care

Mays
sent

the
victim
claims

“
I

for
something
I
should
be
getting
thanked
for

Toronto

city
in

It
is

Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
The
area
was
first
settled
in
the
00th
century
,
when
it
was
known
as
Newburg
's
Landing
.

When
the
railway
was
built
,
however
,
the
area
's
name
was
changed
to
Sloanes
Station
.

In
0000
,
after
a
vote
,
the
town
was
incorporated
under
its
present
name
.

This
was
taken
from
the
much
larger
Canadian
city
of
the
same
name
,
which
civic
leader
Thomas
M.
Daniels
felt
was
a
place
worth
emulating
.

In
the
00th
century
,
the
town
became
a
center
of
heavy
industry
with
a
number
of
large
factories
in
and
around
the
town
.

In
the
0000s
and
0000s
the
city
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
region
,
declined
sharply
as
manufacturing
jobs
left
.

Today
the
only
major
employer
is
the
Titanium
Metals
Corporation
,
and
it
is
employing
fewer
and
fewer
workers
each
year
.
