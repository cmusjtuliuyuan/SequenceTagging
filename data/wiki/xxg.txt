founded
by
developers
headed
by
William

,
Crews
who

by
"
big
city
living
"
in
Tulsa

Development
began

land
,
although
the
final
order
of
incorporation
was
not
received
by

until
February

,
0000

Winchester
made
the
news
briefly
in
March
0000
when
the
Institute
for
the
Study
of
American
Wars
(
ISAW
)
,
a
Delaware-based
nonprofit
organization
,
chose
Winchester
over
competing
sites
in
Oklahoma
,
Arizona
,
Pennsylvania
and
New
Mexico
for
a
proposed
$
000
million
war
museum
complex
.

However
,
the
selection
was
withdrawn
in
April
after
a
disagreement
regarding
donation
of
the
land
.

ISAW
claimed
the
State
of
Oklahoma
could
not
or
would
not
follow
through
on
an
earlier
pledge
of
immediate
donation
in
fee
of
000
acres
of
land
,
and
was
instead
offering
only
a
000-year
lease
of
the
land
and/or
was
demanding
proof
that
ISAW
had
the
funding
to
build
the
museum
prior
to
transfer
of
the
land
.

ISAW
later
admitted
to
having
raised
only
$
00,000
.

ISAW
then
selected
the
Phoenix
area
and
on
July
00
,
0000
announced
the
exact
site
as
a
donated
000
acres
of
a
0,000-acre
cotton
farm
between
Phoenix
and
Tucson
once
owned
by
movie
star
John
Wayne
,
known
as
John
Wayne
's
Red
River
Ranch
,
in
Casa
Grande
,
Arizona
.

In
the
end
,
the
museum
was
never
built
in
any
location
,
and
ISAW
's
entity
status
was
voided
effective
March
0
,

by

discovered
petroleum
northeast
of
the

.

Burbank
became
a
boom
town
and
other
towns
in
the
area
such
as
Whizbang
sprang
up
overnight
to
exploit
the
rich
petroleum
resources
.

The
Burbank
field
was
mostly
located
in

field
extended
over
an
area
about

Osage
tribe
and
its
members
received
$
00
million
in
royalties
from
the
Burbank
field
in
the
0000s
.

The
Osage
,
unlike
many
tribes
,
had
retained
collective
ownership
of
mineral
rights
on
their
former
reservation
.

Osage
with
a
full
headright
(
those

a
town
in

County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

It

Ohio
Senator
James
B.
Foraker
.

The
Tallgrass
Prairie
Preserve
is
southeast

town
.

The
official
population

declined
steadily
since
0000
.

According

History
Located
in
an
area
of
rolling
plains
and
tallgrass
prairie
,
a
post
office
was
established
at
Foraker
on
February
00
,
0000
.

The
town
began
as
a
000-acre
tract
platted
by
the
U.S.
Department
of
the
Interior
along
the
Midland
Valley
Railroad
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
the
town
had
a
population
of
000
as
the
area
underwent
a
ranching
and
farming
boom
.

Foraker
had
the
amenities
associated

communities
:
sidewalks
,
a
public
park
,
and
plans
for
an
electric
and
water
system
and
a
substantial
school
building
.

The
agriculture
boom
subsided

briefly
revitalized
by
discovery
of
the
Burbank
Oil
Field
in
0000
,
which
Foraker
an
oil
industry
equipment
supply
center
.

In
0000
the

making
Foraker
an
oil
shipping
point
.

The

County
oil
boom
declined
during

,
and
with
it
Foraker
's
fortunes
.

The
Osage
Valley
railroad
was
abandoned
in
0000
and

business
district

A
lonely

History
The
town
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
though
the
initial
settlement
developed
in
the
late
0000s
.

From
the
early
0000s
to
0000
,
Hominy
was
home
to
a
professional
football
team
composed
of
Native

players
.

The

defeated
the
New
York
Giants
in
0000
,
just
after
the
Giants
were
named
champions
of
the
National
Football
League
.

The
team
had
a
00-game
winning
streak
at
one
point
during
its
existence
,
but
was
disbanded
due
to
the
onset
of
the
Great
Depression
.

A
medium
security
prison
was
constructed
at
the
price
of
$
00.0
million
and
received
its
first
inmates
in
August
0000
in
Hominy
.

It
was
originally
named
the
Jess
Dunn
Correctional
Center
in
honor
of
a
warden
killed
in
an
escape
attempt
.

A
0000
joint
resolution
renamed
the
facility
the
Dick
Conner
Correctional
Center
.

The
facility
reached
its
original
design
capacity
of

during
the
spring
of

.

The
prison
was
badly
damaged
by
a
riot
that
took
place
on
August
00
and
00
,
0000
.

A
riot
proclamation
was
issued
by
then
Governor
George
Nigh
on
August
00
,
0000
.

The
inmates
torched
the
buildings
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
and
completely
destroyed
the
library
,
school
,
and
church
area
.

All
of
this
resulted
in
the
death
of
an
inmate
and
the
loss
of
$
0
million
to
the
taxpayer
.

The
first
special
session
of

Legislature
re-appropriated
nearly
$

million
to
fund
reconstruction
of

facility

History
What
became
Commerce
was
land
that
was
part
of
the
Quapaw
Indian
Agency
,
allocated
in
the
late
0000s
.

The
Quapaw
had
moved
to
the
area
after
having
historically
resided
on
the
west
side
of
the
Mississippi
River
,
in
what
later
entered
the
union
as
the
state
of
Arkansas
.

U.S.
immigrants
arrived
in
the
form
of
a
mining
camp
,
known
as
Hattonville
,
named
after
Amos
Hatton
,
who
in
0000
had
developed
the
Emma
Gordon
zinc
and
lead
mine
that
had
attracted
the
immigrants
.

Starting
in
0000
,
the
Oklahoma
,
Kansas
and
Missouri
Inter-Urban
Railway
built
a
line
from
Miami
to
Commerce
to
serve
the
mining
industry
;
in
a
series
of
steps
the
line
was
later
acquired
by
the
St.
Louis
–
San
Francisco
Railway
.

In
0000
,
the
post
office
serving
the
residents
was
called
North
Miami
,
though
by
June
0000
the
post
office
took
the
present-day
city
's
name
,
which
came
from
the
Commerce
Mining
and
Royalty
Company
(
CMRC
)
,
which
had
bought
the
mining
camp
.

In
0000
CMRC
had
the
town
platted
;
two
years
later
a
mayor
–
council
government
was
formed
.

By
the
0000
census
,
Commerce
had
a
population
of
0,000
.

Commerce
was
the
site
of
two
notable
events
in
the
mid-0000s
.

In
April
0000
,
Bonnie
and
Clyde
and
their
associate
Henry
Methvin
killed
William
C.
Campbell
,
a
Commerce
police
officer
,
and
briefly
kidnapped
Percy
Boyd
.

By
May
,
Bonnie
and
Clyde
would
both
be
dead
.

In
0000
,
in
an
event
that
would
later
become
notable
in
retrospect
,
Mickey
Mantle
's
father
would
move
his
family
to
Commerce
,
to
work
as
a
miner
;
Mantle
would
later
be
nicknamed
"
The
Commerce
Comet

History
AuctionWeb
was
founded
in
San
Jose
,
California
,
on
September
0
,
0000
,
by
French-born
Iran
ian-American
computer
programmer
Pierre
Omidyar
(
born
on
June
00
,
0000
)
as
part
of
a
larger
personal
site
that
included
,
among
other
things
,
Omidyar
's
own
tongue-in-cheek
tribute
to
the
Ebola
virus
.

One
of
the
first
items
sold
on
eBay
was
a
broken
laser
pointer
for
$
00.00
.

Astonished
,
Omidyar
contacted
the
winning
bidder
to
ask
if
he
understood
that
the
laser
pointer
was
broken
.

In
his
responding
email
,
the
buyer
explained
:
"
I
'm
a
collector
of
broken
laser
pointers
.
"

The
frequently
repeated
story
that
eBay
was
founded
to
help
Omidyar
's
fiancée
trade
Pez
candy
dispensers
was
fabricated
by
a
public
relations
manager
in
0000
to
interest
the
media
,
which
were
not
interested
in
the
company
's
previous
explanation
about
wanting
to
create
a
"
perfect
market
"
.

This
was
revealed
in
Adam
Cohen
's
0000
book
,
The
Perfect
Store
,
and
confirmed
by
eBay
.

Chris
Agarpao
was
hired
as
eBay
's
first
employee
and
Jeffrey
Skoll
was
hired
as
the
first
president
of
the
company
in
early
0000
.

In
November
0000
,
eBay
entered
into
its
first
third-party
licensing
deal
,
with
a
company
called
Electronic
Travel
Auction
to
use
SmartMarket
Technology
to
sell
plane
tickets
and
other
travel
products
.

Growth
was
phenomenal
;
in
January
0000
the
site
hosted
0,000,000
auctions
,
compared
with
000,000
during
the
whole
of
0000
.

The
company
officially
changed
the
name
of
its
service
from
AuctionWeb
to
eBay
in
September
0000
.

Originally
,
the
site
belonged
to
Echo
Bay
Technology
Group
,
Omidyar
's
consulting
firm
.

Omidyar
had
tried
to
register
the
domain
name
echobay.com
,
but
found
it
already
taken
by
the
Echo
Bay
Mines
,
a
gold
mining
company
,
so
he
shortened
it
to
his
second
choice
,
eBay.com
.

In
0000
,
the
company
received
$
0.0
million
in
funding
from
the
venture
capital
firm
Benchmark
Capital
.

Meg
Whitman
was
hired
as
eBay
President
and
CEO
in
March
0000
.

At
the
time
,
the
company
had
00
employees
,
half
a
million
users
and
revenues
of
$
0.0
million
in
the
United
States
.

eBay
went
public
on
September
00
,
0000
,
and
both
Omidyar
and
Skoll
became
instant
billionaires
.

eBay
's
target
share
price
of
$
00
was
all
but
ignored
as
the
price
went
to
$
00.00
on
the
first
day
of
trading
.

As
the
company
expanded
product
categories
beyond
collectibles
into
almost
any
saleable
item
,
business
grew
quickly
.

In
February
0000
,
the
company
purchased
IBazar
,
a
similar
European
auction
web
site
founded
in
0000
and
then
bought
PayPal
on
October
00
,
0000
.

By
early
0000
,
the
company
had
expanded
worldwide
,
counted
hundreds
of
millions
of
registered
users
,
00,000
+
employees
and
revenues
of
almost
$
0.0
billion
.

After
nearly
ten
years
at
eBay
,
Whitman
decided
to
enter
politics
.

On
January
00
,
0000
the
company
announced
that
Whitman
would
step
down
on
March
00
,
0000
and
John
Donahoe
was
selected
to
become
President
and
CEO
.

Whitman
remained
on
the
Board
of
Directors
and
continued
to
advise
Donahoe
through
0000
.

In
late
0000
,
eBay
completed
the
sale
of
Skype
for
$
0.00
billion
,
but
will
still
own
00
%
equity
in
the
company
.

In
July
0000
,
eBay
was
sued
for
$
0.0
billion
by
XPRT
Ventures
that
accused
eBay
of
stealing
information
shared
in
confidence
by
the
inventors
on
XPRT
's
own
patents
,
and
incorporated
it
into
features
in
its
own
payment
systems
,
such
as
PayPal
Pay
Later
and
PayPal
Buyer
Credit
.

On
December
00
,
0000
,
eBay
announced
its
acquisition
of
a
German
online
shopping
club

In

,
eBay
launched
its
Business

category
,
breaking
into
the
industrial
surplus
business
.

Generally
,
anything
can
be
auctioned
on
the
site
as
long
as
it
is
not
illegal
and
does
not
violate
the
eBay
Prohibited
and
Restricted
Items
policy
.

Services
and
intangibles
can
be
sold
,
too
.

Large
international
companies
,
such
as
IBM
,
sell
their
newest
products
and
offer
services
on
eBay
using
competitive
auctions
and
fixed-priced
storefronts
.

Separate
eBay
sites
such
as
eBay
US
and
eBay
UK
allow
the
users
to
trade
using
the
local
currency
.

Software
developers
can
create
applications
that
integrate
with
eBay
through
the
eBay
API
by
joining
the
eBay
Developers
Program
.

In
June
0000
,
there
were
more
than
00,000
members
in
the
eBay
Developers
Program
,
comprising
a
broad
range
of
companies
creating
software
applications
to
support
eBay
buyers
and
sellers
as
well
as
eBay
Affiliates
.

Controversy
has
arisen
over
certain
items
put
up
for
bid
.

For
instance
,
in
late
0000
,
a
man
offered
one
of
his
kidney
s
for
auction
on
eBay
,
attempting
to
profit
from
the
potentially
lucrative
(
and
,
in
the
United
States
,
illegal
)
market
for
transplantable
human
organs
.

On
other
occasions
,
people
and
even
entire
towns
have
been
listed
,
often
as
a
joke
or
to
garner
free
publicity
.

In
general
,
the
company
removes
auctions
that
violate
its
terms
of
service
agreement
.

Beginning
in
August
0000
,
eBay
required
listings
in
"
Video
Games
"
and
"
Health
&
Beauty
"
to
accept
its
payment
system
PayPal
and
sellers
could
only
accept
PayPal
for
payments
in
the
category
"
Video
Games
:
Consoles
"
.

Starting
January
00
,
0000
,
eBay
said
sellers
can
only
accept
PayPal
as
payment
for
the
categories
"

eBay
announced
that
starting
in
March
0000
,
eBay
had
added
to
this
requirement
that
all
sellers
with
fewer
than
000
feedbacks
must
offer
PayPal
and
no
merchant
account
may
be
used
as
an
alternative
.

This
is
in
addition
to
the
requirement
that
all
sellers
from
the
United
Kingdom
have
to
offer
PayPal
.

Further
,
and
as
noted
below
,
it
was
a
requirement
to
offer
Paypal
on
all
listings
in
Australia
and
the
UK
.

In
response
to
concerns
expressed
by
the
Australian
Competition
and
Consumer
Commission
,
however
,
eBay
has
since
removed
the
policy
on
the
ebay.com
.

au
website
requiring
sellers
to
offer
PayPal
as
a
payment
option
.

In
April
0000
,
eBay
opened
its
new
eBay
Express
site
,
which
was
designed
to
work
like
a
standard
Internet
shopping
site
for
consumers
with
United
States
addresses
.

It
closed
in
0000
.

Selected
eBay
items
were
mirrored
on
eBay
Express
,
where
buyers
shopped
using
a
shopping
cart
to
purchase
from
multiple
sellers
.

The
UK
version
was
launched
to
eBay
members
in
mid-October
0000
but
on
January
00
,
0000
eBay
announced
its
intention
to
close
the
site
.

The
German
version
,
eBay
Express
Germany
,
was
also
opened
in
0000
and
closed
in
0000
.

At
the
0000
eBay
Developer
's
Conference
,
eBay
announced
the
Selling
Manager
Applications
program
(
SM
Apps
)
.

The
program
allows
approved
developers
to
integrate
their
applications
directly
into
the
eBay.com
interface
.

The
applications
created
by
developers
are
available
for
subscription
by
eBay
members
who
also
subscribe
to
Selling

.

eBay
maintains
a
number
of
specialty
sites
including
the
discussion
boards
,
groups
,
answer
center
,
chat
rooms
,
and
reviews
and
guides
.

eBay
has
a
robust
mobile
offering
,
including
SMS
alerts
,
a
WAP
site
,
Java
ME
clients
,
an
Android
OS
application
and
an
Apple
iPhone
application
available
in
certain
markets
.

Unusual
items
Many
unusual
items
have
been
placed
for
sale
on
eBay
,
including
at
least
two
previously
undiscovered
species
,
including
the
Coelopleurus
exquisitus
sea
urchin
,
military
vehicles
,
and
items
of
food
.

Prohibited
or
restricted
items
In
its
earliest
days
,
eBay
was
essentially
unregulated
.

However
,
as
the
site
grew
,
it
became
necessary
to
restrict
or
forbid
auctions
for
various
items
.

Note
that
some
of
the
restrictions
relate
to
eBay.com
(
the
U.S.
site
)
,
while
other
restrictions
apply
to
specific
European
sites
(
such
as
Nazi
paraphernalia
)
.

Regional
laws
and
regulations
may
apply
to
the
seller
or
the
buyer
.

Generally
,
if
the
sale
or
ownership
of
an
item
is
regulated
or
prohibited
by
one
or
more
states
,
eBay
will
not
permit
its
listing
.

Among
the
hundred
or
so
banned
or
restricted
categories
:
Bidding
Auction-style
listings
Bidding
on
eBay
's
auction-style
listing
is
called
proxy
bid
ding
and
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
Vickrey
auction
,
with
the
following
exceptions
.

Seller
ratings
In
0000
,
eBay
began
using
detailed
seller
ratings
with
four
different
categories
.

When
leaving
feedback
,
buyers
are
asked
to
rate
the
seller
in
each
of
these
categories
with
a
score
of
one
to
five
stars
,
with
five
being
the
highest
rating
and
one
the
lowest
.

Unlike
the
overall
feedback
rating
,
these
ratings
are
anonymous
;
neither
sellers
nor
other
users
learn
how
individual
buyers
rated
the
seller
.

The
listings
of
sellers
with
a
rating
of
0.0
or
below
in
any
of
the
four
rating
categories
appear
lower
in
search
results
.

Power
Sellers
are
required
to
have
scores
in
each
category
above
0.0
.

In
a
reversal
of
roles
,
on
January
00
,
0000
Auctionbytes.com
held
an
open
survey
in
which
sellers
could
effectively
rate
eBay
itself
,
as
well
as
competing
auction
and
marketplace
sites
.

In
the
survey
,
users
were
asked
to
rank
00
sites
based
on
five
criteria
:
After
the
results
were
published
,
eBay
had
finished
00th
overall
,
edged
out
by
established
sites
such
as
Amazon
and
Craigslist
,
as
well
as
lesser-known
selling
sites
like
Atomic
Mall
and
Ruby
Lane
.

In
individual
category
rankings
,
eBay
was
rated
the
worst
of
all
the
00
sites
on
Customer
Service
and
Communication
,
and
average
on
Ease
of
Use
.

A
number
of
respondents
said
they
would
have
given
eBay
a
rating
of
ten
0
to
0
years
ago
.

eBay
was
rated
twelfth
out
of
fifteen
in
the
Recommended
Selling
Venue
category
.

Charity
auctions
Using
MissionFish
as
an
arbiter
,
eBay
allows
sellers
to
donate
a
portion
of
their
auction
proceeds
to
a
charity
of
the
seller
's
choice
.

The
program
is
called
eBay
Giving
Works
in
the
US
,
and
eBay
for
Charity
in
the
UK
.

eBay
provides
a
partial
refund
of
seller
fees
for
items
sold
through
charity
auctions
.

As
of
March
0
,
0000
,
$
000
million
has
been
raised
for
U.S.
nonprofits
by
the
eBay
Community
since
eBay
Giving
Works
began
in
0000
.

Some
high-profile
charity
auctions
have
been
advertised
on
the
eBay
home
page
,
and
have
raised
large
amounts
of
money
in
a
short
time
.

For
example
,
a
furniture
manufacturer
raised
over
$
00,000
for
Ronald
McDonald
House
by
auctioning
off
beds
that
had
been
signed
by
celebrities
.

To
date
the
highest
successful
bid
on
a
single
item
for
charity
was
for
the
annual
"
Power
Lunch
"
with
investor
Warren
Buffett
at
the
famous
Smith
&
Wollensky
Steakhouse
in
New
York
.

The
winning
bid
was
$
0.00
million
with
all
of
the
proceeds
going
to
the
Glide
Foundation
.

At
the
time
of
writing
,
the
winning
bidder
is
still
not
publicly
known
,
but
they
will
be
able
to
bring
up
to
seven
friends
to
the
lunch
.

The
previous
highest
successful
bid
on
a
single
item
for
charity
was
for
a
letter
sent
to
Mark
P.
Mays
,
CEO
of
Clear
Channel
(
parent
company
of
Premiere
Radio
Networks
the
production
company
that
produces
The
Rush
Limbaugh
Show
and
Glenn
Beck
Program
)
by
Senator
Harry
Reid
and
forty
other
Democratic
senators
,
complaining
about
comments
made
by
conservative
talk
show
host
Rush
Limbaugh
.

The
winning
bid
was
$
0,000,000
,
with
000
percent
of
the
proceeds
going
to
the
Marine
Corps-Law
Enforcement
Foundation
,
benefiting
the
education
of
children
of
men
and
women
who
have
died
serving
in
the
armed
forces
.

The
winning
bid
was
matched
by
Limbaugh
in
his
largest
charity
donation
to
date
.

In
0000
,
eBay
Canada
partnered
with
Montreal-based
digital
branding
agency
CloudRaker
to
develop
a
campaign
to
raise
money
for
Sainte-Justine
children
's
hospital
in
Montreal
.

They
aligned
themselves
with
internet
phenomenon
Têtes
à
claques
to
create
an
eBay
auction
based
on
popular
T-A-C
character
Uncle
Tom
,
an
infomercial
host
who
pitches
absurd
products
.

eBay
and
CloudRaker
reproduced
Uncle
Tom
's
imaginary
products
,
The
Body
Toner
Fly
Swatter
,
The
Willi
Waller
Potato
Peeler
,
and
the
LCD
Shovel
and
sold
them
online
.

In
0
weeks
,
they
raised
$
00,000
for
Hôpital
St-Justine
with
one
fly
swatter
,
one
potato
peeler
,
and
one
shovel
,
a
world
record
.

The
Body
Toner
Fly
Swatter
sold
for
$
0,000
,
the
Willi

Potato
Peeler
sold
for

,
and
the
LCD
Shovel
sold

Shipping
Before
an
auction
,
eBay
lets
sellers
choose
which
shipping
options
to
offer
—
regular
mail
,
express
mail
,
or
courier
service
.

The
website
lets
buyers
choose
which
option
to
accept
.

Since
0000
,
eBay
has
also
allowed
US
sellers
to
opt
into
its
Global
Shipping
Program
.

The
program
works
as
follows
:
Each
seller
decides
whether
or
not
to
opt
into
the
program
.

If
a
seller
opts
in
,
and
a
non-US
buyer
buys
an
item
from
the
seller
,
then
the
buyer
pays
an
additional
fee
to
Pitney
Bowes
.

The
seller
ships
the
item
to
a
Pitney
Bowes
facility
in
the
US
.

After
receiving
the
item
,
Pitney
Bowes
forwards
it
to
the
buyer
.

The
program
enhances
the
selection
available
to
buyers
,
but
considerably
increases
buyers
'
costs
.

Corporate
affairs
Logo
In
September
0000
,
eBay
introduced
a
new
logo
set
in

.

The
logo
was
introduced
to
the
main
website
on
October

Profit
and
transactions
eBay
generates
revenue
from
various
fees
.

The
eBay
fee
system
is
quite
complex
;
there
are
fees
to
list
a
product
and
fees
when
the
product
sells
(
Final
Value
Fee
)
,
plus
several
optional
adornment
fees
,
all
based
on
various
factors
and
scales
.

As
of
November
0000
,
the
U.S.
based
eBay.com
takes
$
0.00
to
$
0
(
based
on
the
opening
or
reserve
price
)
as
an
insertion
fee
for
a
basic
auction-style
listing
without
any
adornments
,
and
0
%
of
the
total
amount
of
the
sale
(
price
of
the
item
plus
shipping
charges
)
as
a
final
value
fee
.

Fixed-price
listings
have
an
insertion
fee
of
$
0.00
,
and
the
final
value
fee
varies
based
on
category
and
total
amount
of
the
sale
(
e.g.
00
%
for
DVDs
&
Movies
up
to
$
00
)
.

The
UK
based
ebay
.

co.
uk
takes
from
GBP
£
0.00
to
a
maximum
rate
of
GBP
£
0
per
£
000
for
an
ordinary
listing
and
from
0.00
percent
to
00
%
(
writing
as
of
June
0000
)
of
the
final
price
.

Reduced
Final
Value
Fees
are
available
to
business
registered
customers
,
though
this
reduction
is
nowhere
near
the
level
of
reduction
that
Ebay
seems
to
enjoy
with
regard
to
its
own
UK
tax
bill
.

In
addition
,
eBay
owns
the
PayPal
payment
system
that
has
fees
of
its
own
.

Under
current
U.S.
law
,
a
state
can
not
require
sellers
located
outside
the
state
to
collect
a
sales
tax
,
making
deals
more
attractive
to
buyers
.

Although
some
state
laws
require
purchasers
to
pay
sales
tax
to
their
own
states
on
out-of-state
purchases
,
it
is
not
a
common
practice
.

However
,
most
sellers
that
operate
as
a
full-time
business
do
follow
state
tax
regulations
on
their
eBay
transactions
.

However
Value
Added
Tax
(
VAT
)
,
a
form
of
sales
tax
in
EU
countries
,
is
different
.

eBay
requires
sellers
to
include
the
VAT
element
in
their
listing
price
and
not
as
an
add-on
and
thus
eBay
profits
by
collecting
fees
based
on
what
governments
tax
for
VAT
;
i.e.
it
not
only
receives
fees
as
a
percentage
of
the
sale
(
net
)
price
but
also
a
similar
percentage
of
the
VAT
element
of
the
overall
(
gross
)
price
.

The
company
's
current
business
strategy
includes
increasing
international
trade
.

eBay
has
already
expanded
to
over
two
dozen
countries
including
China
and
India
.

The
only
places
where
expansion
failed
were
Taiwan
and
Japan
,
where
Yahoo
!

had
a
head
start
,
and
New
Zealand
where
TradeMe
,
owned
by
the
Fairfax
media
group
is
the
dominant
online
auction
website
.

A
more
recent
strategy
involves
the
company
increasingly
leveraging
the
relationship
between
the
eBay
auction
site
and
PayPal
:
The
impact
of
driving
buyers
and
sellers
to
use
PayPal
means
not
only
does
eBay
turn
buyers
into
clients
(
as
a
pure
auction
venue
its
clients
used
to
be
predominantly
sellers
)
but
for
each
new
PayPal
registration
it
achieves
via
the
eBay
auction
site
it
also
earns
offsite
revenue
when
the
resulting
PayPal
account
is
used
in
non-eBay
transactions
.

In
its
Q0
0000
results
,
total
payment
volume
via
PayPal
increased
00
percent
,
but
off
the
eBay
auction
site
it
was
up
00
percent
.

For
most
listing
categories
,
eBay
sellers
are
permitted
to
offer
a
variety
of
payment
systems
such
as
PayPal
,
Paymate
,
ProPay
,
and
Moneybookers
.

eBay
runs
an
affiliate
program
under
the
name
eBay
Partner
Network
.

eBay
affiliate
marketers
were
originally
paid
a
percentage
of
the
eBay
seller
's
transaction
fees
,
with
commissions
ranging
from
00
%
to
00
%
of
the
fees
paid
for
an
item
purchased
.

In
October
0000
,
eBay
changed
to
an
affiliate
payout
system
that
it
calls
Quality
Click
Pricing
,
in
which
affiliates
are
paid
an
amount
determined
by
an
undisclosed
algorithm
.

The
total
earnings
amount
is
then
divided
by
the
number
of
clicks
the
affiliate
sent
to
eBay
and
is
reported
as
Earnings
Per
Click
,
or
EPC
.

On
April
00
,
0000
eBay
reported
a
00
%
Q0
revenue
increase
to
$
0.0
billion
compared
to
their
Q0
in
0000
.

Net
income
was
reported
to
be
at
$
000
million
for

On
May
0
,
0000
,
eBay
announced
the
opening
of
its
newest
building
on
the
company
's
North
Campus
in
San
Jose
,
which
is
the
first
structure
in
the
city
to
be
built
from
the
ground
up
to
LEED
Gold
standards
.

The
building
,
the
first
the
company
had
built
in
its
00-year
existence
,
uses
an
array
of
0,000
solar
panels
,
spanning
,
and
providing
000
kilo
watt
s
of
power
to
eBay
's
campus
.

The
array
can
supply
00
%
–
00
%
of
the
company
's
total
energy
requirements
,
reducing
the
amount
of
greenhouse
gas
es
that
would
be
produced
to
create
that
energy
by
other
means
.

SolarCity
,
the
company
responsible
for
designing
the
array
,
estimates
that
the
solar
panels
installed
on
eBay
's
campus
will
prevent
00
million
pounds
of
carbon
dioxide
from
being
released
into
the
environment
as
a
result
of
replaced
power
production
over
the
next
three
decades
.

Creating
an
equivalent
impact
to
remove
the
same
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
would
require
planting
of
trees
.

The
design
of
the
building
also
incorporates
other
elements
to
reduce
its
impact
on
the
environment
.

The
building
is
equipped
with
a
lighting
system
that
detects
natural
ambient
light
sources
and
automatically
dims
artificial
lighting
to
save
00
%
of
the
power
usually
required
to
light
an
office
building
.

eBay
's
newest
building
also
reduces
demand
on
local
water
supplies
by
incorporating
an
eco-friendly
irrigation
system
,
and
low-flow
shower
heads
and
faucets
.

Even
during
construction
,
more
than
00
%
of
the
waste
from
construction
was
recycled
.

eBay
also
runs
buses
between
San
Francisco
and
the
San
Jose
campus
to
reduce
the
number
of
commuting
vehicles
.

Acquisitions
SkypeeBay
Inc.
acquired
Skype
in
0000
and
significantly
expanded
its
customer
base
to
more
than
000
million
registered
users
worldwide
.

To
focus
on
its
core
e-commerce
and
payments
businesses
,
eBay
Inc.
sold
a
majority
stake
in
Skype
in
November
0000
,
retaining
a
minority
investment
in
the
company
.

In
May
0000
,
Microsoft
announced
that
it
had
acquired
Skype
for
$
0.0
billion
.

Craigslist
In
the
summer
of
0000
,
eBay
acknowledged
that
it
had
acquired
00
%
of
classified
listings
website
,
Craigslist
.

Former
Craigslist
executive
Phillip
Knowlton
was
the
seller
,
and
he
insisted
that
his
former
employer
was
aware
of
his
plans
to
divest
his
holdings
.

Initially
,
eBay
assured
Craigslist
that
they
would
not
ask
the
company
to
change
the
way
it
does
business
.

eBay
spokesman
Hani
Durzy
stated
that
the
"
investment
was
really
for
learning
purposes
;
it
gives
us
access
to
learn
how
the
classified
market
online
works
.
"

In
March
0000
,
eBay
launched
the
classifieds
service
Kijiji
.

In
April
0000
,
eBay
sued
Craigslist
to
"
safeguard
its
four-year
financial
investment
"
,
claiming
that
in
January
0000
,
Craigslist
took
actions
that
"
unfairly
diluted
eBay
's
economic
interest
by
more
than
00
%
.
"

Craigslist
countersued
in
May
0000
"
to
remedy
the
substantial
and
ongoing
harm
to
fair
competition
"
that
Craigslist
claims
is
constituted
by
eBay
's
actions
as
a
Craigslist
shareholder
.

In
September
0000
,
Delaware
Judge
William
Chandler
ruled
that
the
actions
of
Craigslist
were
unlawful
,
and
that
the
actions
taken
by
Craigslist
founders
Jim
Buckmaster
and
Craig
Newmark
had
"
breached
their
fiduciary
duty
of
loyalty
"
,
and
restored
eBay
's
stake
in
the
company
to
00.0
%
from
a
diluted
level
of
00.00
%
.

However
,
the
judge
dismissed
eBay
's
objection
to
a
staggered
board
provision
citing
that
Craigslist
has
the
right
to
protect
its
own
trade
secrets
.

eBay
spokesman
Michael
Jacobson
stated
"
We
are
very
pleased
that
the
court
gave
eBay
what
it
sought
from
the
lawsuit
.
"

Use
for
economics
As
eBay
is
a
huge
,
publicly
visible
market
,
it
has
created
a
great
deal
of
interest
from
economists
,
who
have
used
it
to
analyze
many
aspects
of
buying
and
selling
behavior
,
auction
formats
,
etc.
,
and
compare
these
with
previous
theoretical
and
empirical
findings
.

Just
as
economists
have
shown
interest
in
eBay
's
operations
,
computer
information
systems
researchers
have
also
shown
interest
in
eBay
.

Recently
Michael
Goul
,
Chairman
of
the
Computer
Information
Systems
department
of
the
W.
P.
Carey
School
of
Business
at
Arizona
State
University
,
published
an
academic
case
based
on
eBay
’s
big
data
management
and
use
.

In
the
case
,
Goul
discusses
how
eBay
is
a
data-driven
company
which
processes
00
petabytes
of
data
a
day
.

eBay
uses
a
system
that
allows
different
departments
in
the
company
to
check
out
data
from
their
data
mart
into
sandboxes
for
analysis
.

According
to
Goul
,
eBay
has
already
experienced
significant
business
successes
through
its
data
analytics
.

To
continue
improving
the
business
through
data-driven
decision
making
,
eBay
employs
0,000
data
analysts
.

Controversy
and
criticism
eBay
has
its
share
of
controversy
,
including
cases
of
fraud
,
its
policy
of
requiring
sellers
to
use
PayPal
,
and
concerns
over
forgeries
and
intellectual
property
violations
in
auction
items
.

There
are
also
issues
of
how
negative
feedback
after
an
auction
can
offset
the
benefits
of
using
eBay
as
a
trading
platform
.

eBay
has
also
been
criticised
for
not
paying
its
share
of
UK
tax
:
the
BBC
reported
in
October
0000
that
eBay
pays
only
£
0.0
m
in
tax
on
sales
of
over
£
000m
.

Picher
is
a
ghost
town
and
former
city
in
Ottawa
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

Formerly
a
major
national
center
of
lead
and
zinc
mining
at
the
heart
of
the
Tri-State
Mining
District
,
over
a
century
of
unrestricted
subsurface
excavation
dangerously
undermined
most
of
Picher
's
town
buildings
and
left
giant
piles
of
toxic
metal
-
contaminated
mine
tailings
(
known
as
chat
)
heaped
throughout
the
area
.

The
discovery
of
the
cave-in
risks
,
groundwater
contamination
and
health
effects
associated
with
the
chat
piles
and
subsurface
shafts
—
particularly
an
alarming
0000
study
which
showed
lead
poisoning
in
00
%
of
the
children
in
Picher
—
eventually
prompted
a
mandatory
evacuation
and
buyout
(
via
eminent
domain
)
of
the
entire
township
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
the
incorporation
of
the
town
(
along
with
the
similarly
contaminated
satellite
towns
of
Treece
and
Cardin
)
into
the
Tar
Creek
Superfund
site
.

A
0000
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
study
showed
00
%
of
Picher
's
buildings
(
including
the
town
school
)
were
badly
undermined
and
subject
to
collapse
at
any
time
.

A
F0
tornado
which
destroyed
or
damaged
000
homes
in
May
0000
accelerated
the
exodus
.

The
town
ceased
official
operations
on
September
0
,
0000
and
the
population
plummeted
from
0,000
at
the
0000
census
to
just
00
at
the
0000
census
.

As
of
January
0000
,
only
six
homes
and
one
business
remain
,
their
owners
having
refused
to
leave
at
any
price
;
the
rest
of
the
town
's
buildings
(
excepting
designated
historical
structures
)
are
scheduled
to
be
demolished
by
the
end
of
the
year
.

Picher
is
one
of
only
a
few
locations
in
the
world
(
along
with
others
such
as
Gilman
,
Colorado
and
Wittenoom
,
Western
Australia
)
to
be
evacuated
and
declared
uninhabitable
due
to
environmental
and
health
damage
caused
by
the
mines
the
town
once
serviced
.

History
In
0000
,
as
the
Tri-State
district
expanded
,
lead
and
zinc
ore
were
discovered
on
Harry
Crawfish
's
claim
and
mining
began
.

A
townsite
developed
overnight
around
the
new
workings
and
was
named
Picher
in
honor
of
O.
S.
Picher
,
owner
of
Picher
Lead
Company
.

The
city
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
and
by
0000
,
Picher
had
a
population
of
0,000
.

Peak
population
occurred
in
0000
with
00,000
residents
and
was
followed
by
a
gradual
decline
due
to
the
decrease
in
mining
activity
,
leaving
Picher
with
only
0,000
by
0000
.

The
Picher
area
became
the
most
productive
lead-zinc
mining
field
in
the
Tri-State
district
producing
over
$
00
billion
worth
of
ore
between
0000
and
0000
.

More
than
fifty
percent
of
the
lead
and
zinc
metal
used
during
World
War
I
were
produced
by
the
Picher
district
.

At
its
peak
over
00,000
miners
worked
the
mines
and
another
0,000
worked
in
mining
services
.

Many
of
these
workers
commuted
by
an
extensive
trolley
system
from
as
far
away
as
Joplin
and
Carthage
,
Missouri
.

Mining
ceased
in
0000
and
water
pumping
from
the
mines
ceased
.

The
contaminated
water
from
some
00,000
abandoned
mine
shafts
,
00
million
tons
of
mine
tailings
,
and
00
million
tons
of
mill
sand
and
sludge
remained
as
a
huge
environmental
cleanup
problem
.

The
area
became
part
of
the
Tar
Creek
Superfund
site
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
Reuters
reported
that
Picher
had
been
scheduled
to
be
closed
and
all
residents
removed
.

Due
in
large
part
to
the
removal
of
large
amounts
of
subsurface
material
during
mining
operations
,
many
of
the
city
's
structures
have
been
deemed
in
imminent
danger
of
caving
in
.

The
city
's
pharmacist
,
Gary
Linderman
was
featured
in
the
May
00
,
0000
,
issue
of
People
magazine
in
the
Heroes
Among
Us
article
"
Prescription
for
Kindness
"
.

He
vowed
to
stay
as
long
as
there
was
anyone
left
who
needed
him
and
to
be
the
last
one
out
of
the
city
.

Tornado
On
May
00
,
0000
,
Picher
was
struck
by
an
EF0
tornado
.

There
were
eight
confirmed
deaths
,
possibly
including
one
child
,
and
many
other
injuries
.

The
tornado
first
touched
down
near
the
Kansas
-
Oklahoma
border
in
Oklahoma
southwest
of
Chetopa
,
Kansas
,
and
tracked
eastward
.

It
then
slammed
into
Picher
with
devastating
results
.

Twenty
blocks
of
the
city
suffered
extensive
damage
with
houses
and
businesses
destroyed
or
flattened
.

The
damage
in
Picher
was
rated
at
"
EF0
"
.

At
least
000
others
were
injured
in
Picher
alone
.

The
tornado
continued
eastward
,
passing
just
north
of
Quapaw
and
Peoria
before
crossing
Interstate
00
into
Missouri
.

This
was
the
deadliest
tornado
in
Oklahoma
since
the
South
Oklahoma
City
F0
tornado
on
May
0
,
0000
,
which
killed
00
.

The
federal
government
also
decided
that
there
would
be
no
aid
given
to
rebuild
homes
,
but
the
buyouts
would
continue
as
previously
scheduled
and
people
will
be
assisted
in
relocation
.

Oklahoma
Governor
Brad
Henry
sent
National
Guard
troops
as
well
as
emergency
personnel
to
assist
the
hardest
hit
area
in
Picher
;
twenty
blocks
which
suffered
major
damage
including
several
destroyed
structures
.

Damage
was
reported
in
Peoria
and
Quapaw
.

Loss
of
power
from
the
tornado
forced
the
city
to
go
on
a
boiled
water
notice
.

Staff
from
the
Oklahoma
Rural
Water
Association
arrived
to
assist
,
since
the
utility
's
testing
equipment
was
destroyed
by
the
storm
.

With
an
emergency
generator
to
supply
power
,
rural
water
staff
had
the
system
running
normally
only
two
days
after
the
tornado
struck
.

Closure
In
April
0000
,
residents
voted
00
–
0
to
dissolve
the
Picher-Cardin
school
district
;
it
graduated
its
final
class
of
00
in
May
.

By
0000
the
district
's
enrollment
had
dropped
to
a
total
of
00
students
from
approximately
000
three
years
prior
.

Remaining
students
will
attend
Commerce
and
Quapaw
school
districts
.

The
city
's
post
office
was
scheduled
to
close
in
July
0000
and
the
city
ceased
operations
as
a
municipality
on
September
0
,
0000
.

By
June
00
,
0000
,
all
of
the
residents
had
been
given
federal
checks
to
enable
them
to
relocate
from
Picher
permanently
.

The
city
is
considered
to
be
too
toxic
to
be
habitable
.

On
the
last
day
,
all
the
final
residents
met
at
the
school
auditorium
to
say
goodbye
.

As
of
November
0000
,
it
was
reported
that
Picher
still
had
"
one
business
and
six
occupied
houses
.
"

The
people
of
the
adjacent
city
of
Treece
,
Kansas
,
saw
the
government
carry
out
a
similar
relocation
program
in
their
city
,
too
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
Congress
voted
to
allow
the
EPA
to
fund
the
relocation
of
the
remaining
citizens
of
Treece
.

Starting
in
January
0000
,
almost
all
remaining
commercial
structures
will
be
demolished
,
with
the
single
exception
of
the
Old
Miner
's
Pharmacy
,
whose
owner
,
Gary
Linderman
,
refuses
to
abandon
it

Points
of
interest
Famous
People
of
SkeDee
Kung
Fu
(

series
)
was
based
on
Kwai
Chang
Caine
.

Caine
came
from
China
in
the
mid-to-late
00th
century
in
search
of
his
American
half-brother
,
Daniel
,
or
Danny
.

Unlike
the
TV
show
,
Kwai
Chang
was
not
wanted
by
the
Chinese
givernment
.

He
was
just
searching
for
the
brother
he
had
never
met
.

And
now
the
best
part
...
in
his
research
for
the
new
book
on
The
Cain
's
Ballroom
,
author
,
music
historian
,
and
Western
swing
expert
John
Wooley
has
discovered
that
Danny
Cain
(
he
had
dropped
the
last
"
e
"
by
the
time
Kwai
Chang
arrived
in
America
)
had
settled
in
Skedee
,
Oklahoma
,
and
was
what
we
would
think
of
now
as
an
"
old
time
fiddler
"
playing
jigs
and
dance
tunes
popular
at
the
time
.

After
giving
up
more
than
once
,
Kwai
Chang
finally
tracked
Danny
to
Oklahoma
in
the
early
part
of
the
00th
century
.

Both
were
old
men
by
this
time
.

They
lived
out
their
lives
in
the
Skedee
area
,
with
Kwai
Chang
becoming
a
full
blood-brother
member
of
the
Pawnee
Indians
.

The
Cain
brothers
,
and
their
story
,
were
very
popular
at
the
time
,
with
coverage
in
all
the
local
newspapers
.

In
the
0000s
,
oil
was
discovered
on
the
humble
Cain
farm
,
and
the
brothers
had
extra
money
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
.

Kwai
Chang
chose
to
continue
the
simple
life
,
but
his
brother
,
Daniel
Madison
Cain
,
fulfilled
his
lifelong
dream
of
a
real
world
class
dancehall
.

He
purchased
a
former
automobile
garage
from
Tulsa
business
man
Tate
Brady
,
and
opened
the
doors
to
the
dancing
public
in
0000
.

And
so
,
The
Cain
's
Ballroom
was
born
.

Kwai
Chang
sat
quietly
in
the
back
as
a
young
fiddler
named
Bob
Wills
took
the
stage
for
the
first
time
.

Though
his
brother
's
vision
was
not
a
path
he
wished
to
share
,
it
is
said
that
he
took
great
joy
in
the
joy
of
his
brother
.

Kwai
Chang
died
the
following
year
.

Daniel
Madison
"
Danny
Boy
"
Cain
lived
another
0
years
and
died
at
his
home
on
the
ranch
by
Skedee
.

He
died
in
his
sleep
,
a
happy
man
,
no
doubt
thinking
of
the
many
nights
he
joined
Bob
and
The
Texas
Playboys
on
an
old
time
fiddle
tune
,
while
the
crowd
filled
the
dance
floor
at
The
Cain
's
Ballroom
.

This

conflicts
in

may
well
be
fanciful

Oil
production
became
based
in

This
should

A
Tour
on
the
Prairies
.

He
wrote
of
“
a
glorious
prairie
spreading
out
beneath
the
golden
beams
of
an
autumnal
sun
.

The
deep
and
frequent
traces
of
buffalo
,
showed
it
to
be
a
one
of
their
favorite
grazing
grounds
.

”
On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
Unassigned
Lands
of
the
Oklahoma
Territory
were
opened
for
homesteading

Stillwater
township
and
a
tent
city
with

always
still
.

Another
legend
states
that
cattlemen
driving
herds
from
Texas
to
railways
back
east
always
found
water
"
still
there
"
.

Regardless
,
the
creek
received
its
official
name
in
0000
when
William
L.
Couch
established
his
“
boomer
colony
”
on
its
banks
.

The
placid
,
spring-like
creek
became
known
as
Stillwater
.

While
the
creek
may
have
been
tranquil
,
the
next
few
years
saw
turmoil
as
pioneers
sought
free
,
fertile
land
and
soldiers
held
them
off
while
complicated
legal
issues
and
land
titles
with
Creek
and
Seminole
tribes
were
hashed
out
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
cannons
fired
signaling
the
race
to
acquire
land
,
and
towns
,
including
Stillwater
,
sprang
up
overnight
.

Another
story
of
how
that
goes
is
David
Payne
walked
up
to
Stillwater
Creek
and
said
,
“
This
town
should
be
named
Still
Water
”
.

Members
of
the
board
thought
he
was
crazy
,
but
the
name
stuck
.

Yale
(
Pawnee
:
Iriireetuhraahkaku
,
Iriíraatuhaahkaku
)
is
a
city
in
Payne
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
,
a
decline
of
0.0
percent
from
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Yale
's
founding
in
0000
is
attributed
to
a
local
farmer
,
Sterling
F.
Underwood
,
who
established
a
post
office
by
that
name
in
his
general
store
,
about
east
of
the
present
town
.

When
the
Eastern
Oklahoma
Railway
built
its
line
across
Payne
County
,
a
group
led
by
George
W.
Canfield
began
a
different
townsite
closer
to
the
railroad
.

Underwood
moved
his
store
to
the
new
site
in
0000
,
making
the
new
site
the
permanent
location
for
the
town
of
Yale
.

By
0000
,
Yale
had
a
population
of
000
,
supported
mostly
by

services
and
cotton
processing
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
an
oil
well
on
the
Randle
farm
produced
a
gusher
.

quickly
followed
.

By

of
0000
,
the

fields

barrels
a
day
.

The
town
boomed
,
attaining
a
population
of
0,000
by
the
census
of
0000
.

The
oil
boom
quickly
deflated
.

Production
began
to
decline
sharply
in
0000
,
and
more
dry
holes
were
reported
.

Major
producers
began
to
shut
down
or
reduce
operations
in
the
early
0000s
.

By
0000
,
the
population
had
dropped
to
0,000
.

,
fourteen
miles
east
of
McAlester
and
a
little
more
than
one
mile
west
of

explorer
Jean
Baptiste
Bénard
de
La
Harpe
first
mapped
the
site
of
Haileyville
in
0000
during
his
expedition
to
the
Arkansas
River
.

In
0000
D.
M.
Hailey
,
M.D.
,
established
the
town
of
Haileyville
,
when
he
claimed
a
tract
of
land
east
of
McAlester
and
opened
the
area
's
first
coal
mines
.

A
confederate
veteran
,
Hailey
had
first
moved
into
Indian
Territory
in
0000
to
practice
medicine
and
before
long
had
become
involved
in
several
business
ventures
.

His
mining
investments
began
when
he
and
James
Elliot
started
the
Hailey-Ola
Mining
Company
,
leasing
coal
land
from
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
,
which
laid
tracks

Number
One
Slope
,
began
production

's
Day
in

the
Choctaw
Nation
,
was
a
company
town
,

common
feature
of
coal-mining
communities
.

Italians
,
American
Indians
,
Russians
,
and
Americans
comprised
most
of
Haileyville
,
and
many
worked
in
the
mines
or
on
the
railroads
.

Coal
from
the
area
was
only
profitable
due
to
the
railroad
junction
.

The
town
was
home
to
the
freight
and
passenger
offices
of
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
,
and
Gulf
Railroad
,
which
later
became
the
Chicago
,
Rock
Island
and
Pacific
Railway
Company
(
Rock

the
railroad
had
0,000
miles
of
track
,

a
branch
from
the
town
that
ran
to
Ardmore
.

Haileyville
remained
the
division
point
of
the
Rock
Island
Railroad
until
0000
,
when
the
offices
moved
to
El
Reno
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
U.S.
Post
Office
Department
designated
a
Haileyville
post
office
.

the
New
State
newspaper
,
five
hotels
,
three
doctors
,
and
several
retail
and
other
businesses
served
the

The
community
and
its
close
neighbor
,
Hartshorne
,
are
known
as
the
"
twin

In
the
mathematical
field
of
differential
geometry
,
the
Riemann
curvature
tensor
,
or
Riemann
–
Christoffel
tensor
after
Bernhard
Riemann
and
Elwin
Bruno
Christoffel
,
is
the
most
standard
way
to
express
curvature
of
Riemannian
manifolds
.

It
associates
a
tensor
to
each
point
of
a
Riemannian
manifold
(
i.e.
,
it
is
a
tensor
field
)
,
that
measures
the
extent
to
which
the
metric
tensor
is
not
locally
isometric
to
a
Euclidean
space
.

The
curvature
tensor
can
also
be
defined
for
any
pseudo-Riemannian
manifold
,
or
indeed
any
manifold
equipped
with
an
affine
connection
.

It
is
a
central
mathematical
tool
in
the
theory
of
general
relativity
,
the
modern
theory
of
gravity
,
and
the
curvature
of
spacetime
is
in
principle
observable
via
the
geodesic
deviation
equation
.

The
curvature
tensor
represents
the
tidal
force
experienced
by
a
rigid
body
moving
along
a
geodesic
in
a
sense
made
precise
by
the
Jacobi
equation
.

The
curvature
tensor
is
given
in
terms
of
the
Levi-Civita
connection
\
nabla
by
the
following
formula
:
where
[
u
,
v
]
is
the
Lie
bracket
of
vector
fields
.

For
each
pair
of
tangent
vectors
u
,
v
,
R
(
u
,
v
)
is
a
linear
transformation
of
the
tangent
space
of
the
manifold
.

It
is
linear
in
u
and
v
,
and
so
defines
a
tensor
.

Occasionally
,
the
curvature
tensor
is
defined
with
the
opposite
sign
.

If
u
=
\
partial
/
\
partial
x
^
i
and
v
=
\
partial
/
\
partial
x
^
j
are
coordinate
vector
fields
then
[
u
,
v
]
=
0
and
therefore
the
formula
simplifies
to
The
curvature
tensor
measures
noncommutativity
of
the
covariant
derivative
,
and
as
such
is
the
integrability
obstruction
for
the
existence
of
an
isometry
with
Euclidean
space
(
called
,
in
this
context
,
flat
space
)
.

The
linear
transformation
w
\
mapsto
R
(
u
,
v
)
w
is
also
called
the
curvature
transformation
or
endomorphism
.

The
curvature
formula
can
also
be
expressed
in
terms
of
the
second
covariant
derivative
defined
as
:
which
is
linear
in
u
and
v.
Then
:
Thus
in
the
general
case
of
non-coordinate
vectors
u
and
v
,
the
curvature
tensor
measures
the
noncommutativity
of
the
second
covariant
derivative
.

Geometrical
meaning
When
a
vector
in
a
Euclidean
space
is
parallel
transport
ed
around
a
loop
,
it
will
again
point
in
the
initial
direction
after
returning
to
its
original
position
.

However
,
this
property
does
not
hold
in
the
general
case
.

The
Riemann
curvature
tensor
directly
measures
the
failure
of
this
in
a
general
Riemannian
manifold
.

This
failure
is
known
as
the
holonomy
of
the
manifold
.

Let
xt
be
a
curve
in
a
Riemannian
manifold
M.
Denote
by
τxt
:
Tx0M
→
TxtM
the
parallel
transport
map
along
xt
.

The
parallel
transport
maps
are
related
to
the
covariant
derivative
by
for
each
vector
field
Y
defined
along
the
curve
.

Suppose
that
X
and
Y
are
a
pair
of
commuting
vector
fields
.

Each
of
these
fields
generates
a
pair
of
one-parameter
groups
of
diffeomorphisms
in
a
neighborhood
of
x0
.

Denote
by
τtX
and
τtY
,
respectively
,
the
parallel
transports
along
the
flows
of
X
and
Y
for
time
t.
Parallel
transport
of
a
vector
Z
∈
Tx0M
around
the
quadrilateral
with
sides
tY
,
sX
,
−
tY
,
−
sX
is
given
by
This
measures
the
failure
of
parallel
transport
to
return
Z
to
its
original
position
in
the
tangent
space
Tx0M
.

Shrinking
the
loop
by
sending
s
,
t
→
0
gives
the
infinitesimal
description
of
this
deviation
:
where
R
is
the
Riemann
curvature
tensor
.

Coordinate
expression
Converting
to
the
tensor
index
notation
,
the
Riemann
curvature
tensor
is
given
by
where
\
partial
_
=
\
partial
/
\
partial
x
^
are
the
coordinate
vector
fields
.

The
above
expression
can
be
written
using
Christoffel
symbols
:
(
see
also
the
list
of
formulas
in
Riemannian
geometry
)
.

The
Riemann
curvature
tensor
is
also
the
commutator
of
the
covariant
derivative
of
an
arbitrary
covector
A
_
\
,
with
itself
:
since
the
connection
\
Gamma
^
\
alpha
_
\
,
is
torsionless
,
which
means
that
the
torsion
tensor
\
Gamma
^
\
lambda
_
-
\
Gamma
^
\
lambda
_
\
,
vanishes
.

This
formula
is
often
called
the
Ricci
identity
.

This
is
the
classical
method
used
by
Ricci
and
Levi-Civita
to
obtain
an
expression
for
the
Riemann
curvature
tensor
.

In
this
way
,
the
tensor
character
of
the
set
of
quantities
R
^
_
\
,
is
proved
.

This
identity
can
be
generalized
to
get
the
commutators
for
two
covariant
derivatives
of
arbitrary
tensors
as
follows
This
formula
also
applies
to
tensor
densities
without
alteration
,
because
for
the
Levi-Civita
(
not
generic
)
connection
one
gets
:
It
is
sometimes
convenient
to
also
define
the
purely
covariant
version
by
Symmetries
and
identities
The
Riemann
curvature
tensor
has
the
following
symmetries
:
The
last
identity
was
discovered
by
Ricci
,
but
is
often
called
the
first
Bianchi
identity
or
algebraic
Bianchi
identity
,
because
it
looks
similar
to
the
Bianchi
identity
below
.

(
Also
,
if
there
is
nonzero
torsion
,
the
first
Bianchi
identity
becomes
a
differential
identity
of
the
torsion
tensor
.
)

These
three
identities
form
a
complete
list
of
symmetries
of
the
curvature
tensor
,
i.e.
given
any
tensor
which
satisfies
the
identities
above
,
one
can
find
a
Riemannian
manifold
with
such
a
curvature
tensor
at
some
point
.

Simple
calculations
show
that
such
a
tensor
has
n
^
0
(
n
^
0-0
)
/
00
independent
components
.

Yet
another
useful
identity
follows
from
these
three
:
On
a
Riemannian
manifold
one
has
the
covariant
derivative
\
nabla_u
R
and
the
Bianchi
identity
(
often
called
the
second
Bianchi
identity
or
differential
Bianchi
identity
)
takes
the
form
:
Given
any
coordinate
chart
about
some
point
on
the
manifold
,
the
above
identities
may
be
written
in
terms
of
the
components
of
the
Riemann
tensor
at
this
point
as
:
The
algebraic
symmetries
are
also
equivalent
to
saying
that
R
belongs
to
the
image
of
the
Young
symmetrizer
corresponding
to
the
partition
0
+0
.

Special
cases
For
a
two-dimensional
surface
,
the
Bianchi
identities
imply
that
the
Riemann
tensor
can
be
expressed
as
where
g
_
is
the
metric
tensor
and
K
is
a
function
called
the
Gaussian
curvature
and
a
,
b
,
c
and
d
take
values
either
0
or
0
.

The
Riemann
tensor
has
only
one
functionally
independent
component
.

The
Gaussian
curvature
coincides
with
the
sectional
curvature
of
the
surface
.

It
is
also
exactly
half
the
scalar
curvature
of
the
0-manifold
,
while
the
Ricci
curvature
tensor
of
the
surface
is
simply
given

A
Riemannian
manifold

,
if
the

McAlester
is
a

The
population
was
00000
at
the

of
Pittsburg
County
.

It
is
currently
the

city
in
the
Choctaw
Nation
of
Oklahoma
,
followed
by
Durant
.

The
town
gets
its
name
from
J.J.
McAlester
,
who
later
became
Lieutenant
Governor
of
Oklahoma
and
was
immortalized
as
a
character
in
the
novel
True
Grit
,
which
was
then
made
into
feature
films
in
0000
and
0000

is
the
home
of
the
Oklahoma
State
Penitentiary
,
site
of
an
"
inside

"
prison
rodeo
from
which
ESPN

the
state
prison
simply
as
"
Big
Mac
"

"
McAlester
,
"

for
having
been
the
home
base
of
several
noted
American

History
The
crossing
of
the
east-west
California
Road
with
the
north-south
Texas
Road
formed
a
natural
point
of
settlement
in
Tobucksy
County
of
the
Choctaw
Nation
.

Alyssia
Young
who
emigrated
from
Mississippi
to
the
Indian
Territory
first
established
a
settlement
at
the
intersection
of
the
two
roads
in
0000
.

The
town
there
was
named
after
Perry
by
being
called
Perryville
.

At
one
time
Perryville
was
the
capitol
of
the
Choctaw
Nation
and
County
Seat
of
Tobucksy
County
.

During
the
War
Between
the
States
the
Choctaw
allied
with
the
Confederate
States
of
America
(
CSA
)
as
the
war
reached
Indian
Territory
[
0
]
a
depot
providing
supplies
to
Confederate
Forces
in
Indian
Territory
was
set
up
at
Perryville
.

On
August
00
,
0000
a
force
of
0,000
Union
soldiers
crossed
the
Canadian
River
and
destroyed
the
Confederate
munitions
depot
at
Perryville
.

This
became
known
as
the
Battle
of
Perryville
Indian
Territory
.

Major
General
James
G.
Blunt
(
Union
)
finding
the
Confederate
supplies
and
realizing
that
Perryville
was
a
major
supply
depot
for
Confederate
forces
ordered
the
town
burned
.

The
town
was
rebuilt
,
but
never
reached
its
prewar
glory
or
population
.

After
the
end
of
the
war
and
the
surrender
of
General
Stand
Waite
,
Captain
James
Jackson
McAlester
obtained
a
job
with
the
trading
company
of
Reynolds
and
Hannaford
.

McAlester
,
an
employee
of
licensed
traders
Reynolds
and
Hannaford
convinced
the
firm
to
locate
a
general
store
at
Tupelo
in
the
Choctaw
Nation
.

McAlester
had
learned
of
coal
deposits
in
Indian
Territory
during
the
War
Between
the
States
while
serving
as
a
Captain
with
the
00nd
Arkansas
Volunteer
Infantry
(
Confederate
)
.

At
Fort
Smith
Arkansas
before
going
to
work
with
Reynolds
and
Hannaford
McAlester
had
received
maps
of
the
coal
deposits
from
engineer
Oliver
Weldon
,
who
had
served
with
McAlester
during
the
war
.

Weldon
had
worked
for
the
U.S.
surveying
Indian
Territory
before
the
war
and
knew
of
the
rich
coal
deposits
.

Hearing
of
the
railroad
plans
to
extend
through
Indian
Territory
and
knowing
that
rich
deposits
of
coal
were
in
an
area
north
of
the
town
of
Perryville
,
McAlester
convinced
Reynolds
and
Hannaford
that
Bucklucksy
would
be
a
more
suitable
and
profitable
location
for
the
trading
post
.

McAlester
constructed
a
trading
post/general
store
at
that
location
in
late
0000
.

The
general
store
was
an
immediate
success
,
but
J.
J.
McAlester
recognized
an
even
greater
opportunity
in
the
abundance
of
coal
deposits
in
the
area
,
and
he
began
obtaining
rights
to
the
coal
deposits
from
the
Choctaws
anticipating
the
impending
construction
of
a
rail
line
through
Indian
Territory
.

By
virtue
of
having
been
the
first
to
extend
its
line
to
the
northern
border
of
Indian
Territory
,
the
Union
Pacific
Railway
Southern
Branch
earned
right
of
way
and
a
liberal
bonus
of
land
to
extend
the
line
to
Texas
.

A
number
of
New
York
businessmen
,
including
Levi
P.
Morton
,
Levi
Parsons
,
August
Belmont
,
J.
Pierpont
Morgan
,
George
Denison
and
John
D.
Rockefeller
were
interested
in
extending
rail
line
through
Indian
Territory
,
and
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
,
familiarly
called
the
Katy
Railroad
,
began
its
corporate
existence
in
0000
toward
that
end
.

Morton
and
Parsons
selected
a
site
near
the
Kansas
border
with
Indian
Territory
at
which
a
town
operated
by
the
railroad
could
be
located
,
with
the
settlement
incorporated
under
the
name
of
Parsons
,
Kansas
,
in
0000
.

That
same
year
,
J.J.
McAlester
,
after
buying
out
Reynolds
’
share
of
the
trading
post
,
journeyed
with
a
sample
of
coal
to
the
railroad
town
in
hopes
of
persuading
officials
to
locate
the
line
near
his
store
at
Bucklucksy
.

The
location
of
the
trading
post
on
the
Texas
Road
weighed
in
its
favor
,
given
that
the
Katy
Railroad
line
construction
roughly
followed
the
Shawnee
Trail
–
Texas
Road
route
southward
to
the
Red
River
.

The
line
reached
Bucklucksy
in
0000
,
and
Katy
Railroad
officials
named
the
railway
stop
McAlester
.

With
the
coming
of
the
railroad
,
businesses
in
nearby
Perryville
began
relocating
to
be
near
the
McAlester
Rail
Depot
,
marking
the
end
of
Perryville
and
the
beginning
of
McAlester
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
J.J.
McAlester
married
Rebecca
Burney
(
born
0000
in
Mississippi
-
died
May
0
,
0000
,
in
Oklahoma
)
.

Rebecca
was
a
member
of
the
Chickasaw
Nation
and
this
made
it
possible
for
McAlester
to
gain
citizenship
and
the
right
to
own
property
in
both
the
Choctaw
and
Chickasaw
nations
.

This
allowed
McAlester
to
legally
obtain
his
own
mineral
rights
to
the
coal
deposits
.

McAlester
being
a
savvy
businessman
quickly
obtained
land
near
the
intersection
of
the
north-south
and
east-west
rail
line
intersection
.

McAlester
opened
a
second
general
store
on
this
corner
and
was
able
to
continue
doing
business
selling
coal
to
the
railroads
.

Fritz
Sittle
(
Sittel
)
,
a
Choctaw
citizen
by
marriage
and
one
of
the
first
settlers
in
the
area
,
urged
visiting
newspaperman
Edwin
D.
Chadick
in
0000
to
pursue
the
possibility
of
establishing
an
east-west
rail
line
to
run
through
the
coal
mining
district
at
Krebs
that
would
connect
with
the
north-south
line
at
McAlester
.

Chadick
eventually
found
financing
and
established
the
Choctaw
Coal
and
Railway
in
0000
,
but
was
unable
to
come
to
terms
with
J.J.
McAlester
over
the
issue
of
right
of
way
.

Chadick
and
his
investors
purchased
land
to
the
south
of
McAlester
's
General
Store
,
and
where
the
two
rail
lines
crossed
formed
a
natural
trading
crossroads
,
and
quickly
became
a
bustling
community
designated
as
South
McAlester
.

The
original
town
location
became
known
familiarly
as
North
McAlester
or
North
Town
although
early
U.S.
Census
records
simply
identified
it
as
McAlester
.

The
two
towns
operated
as
somewhat
separate
communities
until
0000
,
when
the
United
States
Congress
passed
an
Act
joining
the
two
communities
as
a
single
municipality
,
the
action
being
required
since
the
towns
were
under
Federal
jurisdiction
in
Indian
Territory
.

The
separate
entities
of
McAlester
and
South
McAlester
were
combined
under
the
single
name
McAlester
with
office-holders
of
South
McAlester
as
officials
of
the
single
town
.

Designation
as
a
single
community
by
the
United
States
Post
Office
came
on
July
0
,
0000
,
nearly
five
months
before
Oklahoma
Statehood
,
which
caused
a
redrawing
of
county
lines
and
designations
and
the
majority
of
Tobucksy
County
fell
within
the
new
lines
of
Pittsburg
County
.

J.J.
McAlester
was
instrumental
in
starting
the
coal
mining
industry
,
telephone
company
,
electrical
company
and
other
businesses
in
the
town
of
McAlester
.

McAlester
was
the
site
of
the
0000
trial
of
Terry
Nichols
on
Oklahoma
state
charges
related
to
the
Oklahoma
City
bombing
(
0000
)
.

On
December
00
,
0000
an
ice
storm
hit
the
area
leaving
residence
without
electrical
service
and
water
for
more
than
two
weeks
;
in
January
0000
,
another
devastating
ice
storm
crippled
the
city
,
leaving
residents
without
power
and
water
for
more
than
a

History
In
the
late
0000s
,
the
Daggs
family
(
by
way
of
Texas
)
became
the
first
family
to
settle
what
is
now
known
as
Ada
,
which
was
originally
known
as
Daggs
Prairie
.

In
April
0000
,
Jeff
Reed
(
a
native
Texan
,
and
relative
of
the
Daggs
family
)
was
appointed
to
carry
the
mail
from
Stonewall
to
Center
(
which
was
later
combined
with
Pickett
)
,
two
small
communities
in
the
Indian
Territory
.

With
his
family
and
his
stock
,
he
sought
a
place
for
a
home
on
a
prairie
midway
between
the
two
points
,
where
he
constructed
a
log
house
and
started
Reed
's
Store
.

Other
settlers
soon
built
homes
nearby
.

In
0000
,
a
post
office
was
established
and
named
after
Reed
's
oldest
daughter
,
Ada
.

Ada
was
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
and
grew
rapidly
with
the
arrival
of
the
St.
Louis
and
San
Francisco
Railway
line
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
an
organized
mob
hanged
four
men
set
to
be
tried
for
the
murder
of
a
former
U.S.
marshal
and
member
of
the
local
freemason
lodge
.

The
town
had
a
population
of
about
0,000
at
the
time
,
and
00
murders
a
year
at
the
time
of
the
lynching
.

The
Daily
Ardmoreite
reported
that
the
four
lynched
men
were
"
one
of
the
bloodiest
band
of
murderers
in
the
state
of
Oklahoma
and
an
organization
of
professional
assassins
,
that
for
a
record
of
blood
crimes
,
probably
has
no
equal
in
the
annals
of
criminal
history
in
the
entire
southwest
.

murders
In
0000
,
a
book
by
author
John
Grisham
brought
Ada
into
the
national
spotlight
related
to
the
false
convictions

imprisonment
of

murder
of

Sue
"
Debbie
"
Carter
and
two
individuals
convicted
of
the
murder
of
Denice
Haraway
that
the
city
officials
were
under
pressure
to
solve
.

The
cases
were
researched
by
a
New

reporter
and
were
the
subject
of
the
book
The
Dreams
of
Ada
and
eventually
written
about
in
The
Innocent
Man
,
Grisham
's
first
non-fiction
book
.

Accounts
from
both
books
suggest
major
flaws

outright
miscarriages
of
justice
including
forced

made-up
confessions
by

History
Beginnings
Asher
dates
back
to
0000
when
George
"
Matt
"
Asher
,
from
Clay
County
,
Kentucky
,
purchased
land
in
Oklahoma
Territory
from
a
Shawnee
estate
salesperson
to
set
up
his
farm
home
.

The
post
office
was
established
November
00
,
0000
when
the
postmaster
of
nearby
Avoca
,
Oklahoma
,
George
A.
McCurry
,
moved
the
Avoca
post
office
and
his
store
to
the
new
community
that
would
become
Asher
.

This
was
done
without
permission
from
the
government
and
left
Avoca
without
a
post
office
.

According
to
the
tale
,
McCurry
was
given
a
home
and
store
building
as
payment
for
moving
the
post
office
to
the
new
settlement
.

The
town
was
named
for
Mr.
Asher
,
who
supplied
the
land
with
the
consideration
the
community
would
carry
his
namesake
,
though
he
never
lived
there
.

There
was
a
sale
of
public
lots
in
0000
.

Avoca
Township
Asher
is
the
last
remaining
post
office
in
the
original
Avoca
Township
,
which
also
included
the
towns
of
Sacred
Heart
Mission
,
Osmit
,
Avoca
,
Meanko
,
Boyer
and
Violet
.

Growth
On
October
00
,
0000
,
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
(
CO&G
)
bought
the
Shawnee
to
Tecumseh
Railway
branch
from
the
Tecumseh
Railway
Co.
and
promptly
extended
the
branch
to
Asher
.

For
the
next
00
years
,
Asher
would
serve
as
the
termination
point
for
the
branch
and
its
engine
,
"
Old
Beck
"
.

Rapid
construction
of
railroads
opened
up
of
a
fertile
section
of
the
South
Canadian
River
valley
to
shipping
facilities
.

Asher
was
the
trade
center
and
market
of
the
area
.

Further
development
came
when
,
on
January
00
,
0000
,
The
Jennings
Company
closed
on
0,000
business
and
residence
lots
.

The
Jennings
Company
advertised
investment
in
the
growing
town
and
new
factories
and
industries
of
various
kinds
soon
located
in
Asher
.

Asher
and
the
new
settlers
had
hopes
of
creating
a
large
city
.

However
,
the
settlers
were
disappointed
when
the
towns
of
Seminole
and
Konawa
were
built
and
took
away
much
of
Asher
’s
trade
.

The
people
of
Asher
would
not
give
up
,
and
pulled
together
town
resources
and
constructed
a
bridge
across
the
Canadian
River
.

The
state
then
used
the
bridge
in
its
construction
of
State
Highway
00
,
drawing
a
small
amount
of
trade
to
the
area
from
nearby
cities
,
such
as
Ada
.

Before
the
construction
of
the
bridge
,
those
south
of
Asher
could
only
cross
the
river
when
it
was
shallow
enough
.

Asher
,
originally
a
cotton
farming
community
,
suffered
in
its
early
years
from
crop
losses
caused
by
boll
weevils
.

Farmers
were
then
dealt
a
further
blow
when
the
town
’s
first
two
cotton
gins
were
destroyed
by
fire
.

These
setbacks
compounded
the
loss
of
trade
and
left
the
town
in
dire
straits
.

In
0000
,
oil
was
discovered
in
and
around
the
town
.

Asher
sprang
up
almost
overnight
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
oil
workers
.

It
was
also
around
this
time
that
executives
moved
into
Asher
and
purchased
enormous
amounts
of
supplies
and
merchandise
at
inflated
prices
.

There
were
many
businesses
in
town
including
feed
and
grocery
stores
,
jewelry
stores
and
drug
stores
as
well
as
banks
,
barber
shops
,
hotels
and
a
small
theater
.

Many
leading
families
of
Oklahoma
,
such
as
the
McAlisters
,
the
O'Dells
,
the
Patterson
's
,
the
Campbells
and
the
Byruns
,
lived
in
the
town
.

There
were
also
many
doctors
with
offices
in
Asher
.

For
a
while
,
Asher
became
prosperous
.

County
Seat
potential
Tecumseh
,
Oklahoma
was
originally
the
county
seat
of
Pottawatomie
County
.

In
late
0000
,
a
long-standing
war
between
Shawnee
and
Tecumseh
escalated
when
voters
approved
measures
to
move
the
seat
to
Shawnee
.

A
spin-off
of
this
feud
was
the
move
for
the
creation
of
a
new
county
,
to
be
named
Petroleum
County
.

The
new
county
would
be
composed
of
prime
oil-producing
land
,
including
the
southern
half
of
Pottawatomie
County
and
portions
of
Seminole
,
Pontotoc
and
McClain
Counties
.

The
move
was
started
by
Tecumseh
supporters
who
wanted
to
make
Shawnee
’s
county
seat
victory
as
hollow
as
possible
by
removing
the
most
valuable
section
of
the
county
.

Asher
was
slated
to
be
the
county
seat
and
it
was
planned
that
the
greater
part
of
Tecumseh
would
move
down
to
form
an
impressive
community
.

There
was
a
paper
--
The
Petroleum
County
Times
—
produced
,
meetings
held
and
petitions
circulated
.

However
,
the
measure
never
progressed
further
as
times
were
not
favorable
for
the
creation
of
a
new
county
.

End
of
the
oil
boom
The
oil
boom
ended
when
only
four
wells
proved
to
be
profitable
.

Once
again
,
Asher
was
in
danger
of
dying
out
.

Fortunately
,
another
oil
well
was
found
just
west
of
the
town
.

This
time
the
people
connected
to
the
well
were
local
citizens
and
were
cautious
and
conservative
in
their
estimates
and
spending
.

This
led
to
a
small
but
steady
production
of
oil
in
the
community
.

Asher
was
dealt
another
setback
in
0000
when
SH-00
was
taken
out
of
commission
and
traffic
was
diverted
west
of
town
on
the
new
US
Highway
000
.

Businesses
migrated
to
the
new
highway
and
many
storefronts
in
the
original
town
were
closed
.

The
final
business
,
Green
's
Market
,
which
was
located
on
Division
Street
(
old
SH-00
)
closed
in
0000
,
after
serving
the
community
for
00
years
.

Several
businesses
on
US-000
remain
,
mostly
serving
those
traveling
through
the
area
.

Centennial
In
0000
,
Asher
celebrated
its
000th
anniversary
.

The
town
,
along
with
others
in
the
county
that
had
passed
the
centennial
mark
,
was
honored
on
a
centennial
monument
dedicated
September
00
,
0000
.

This
date
was
chosen
to
coincide
with
the
Oklahoma
Centennial
.

Other
Asher
honorees
were
the
First
Baptist
Church
,
which
was
founded
in
0000
and
Asher
School
,
which
was
established
in
0000
.

The
monument
is
located
in
Centennial
Park
,
on
the
grounds
of
the
Santa
Fe
Museum
,
in
Shawnee
,
Oklahoma
.

Asher
School
Brief
history
Asher
Public
Schools
is
an
independent
school
district
.

It
has
an
elementary
school
(
grades
Pre-K
to
0
)
and
a
high
school
(
grades
0
to
00
)
.

The
school
was
established
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
there
were
four
other
school
districts
within
three
miles
(
0
km
)
of
Asher
—
Clover
Dale
,
Gravel
Hill
,
Avoca
,
and
Pleasant
Hill
.

The
schools
were
small
,
consisting
of
only
a
room
or
two
.

Basic
facilities
were
at
a
minimum
.

Talk
began
of
consolidating
all
of
the
schools
into
the
Asher
district
.

This
was
later
accomplished
,
presumably
around
the
time
Asher
’s
new
school
building
was
built
in
0000
.

Original
building
Asher
Schools
’
main
and
original
building
(
after
consolidation
)
was
constructed
in
0000
.

The
building
would
later
receive
two
additions
,
to
either
end
.

The
center
of
the
facility
originally
served
as
the
schools
’
gym
,
before
being
converted
to
an
auditorium
when
a
new
gym
was
built
in
the
0000s
.

An
extensive
renovation
was
completed
in
late
0000
on
the
original
building
.

The
work
was
made
possible
by
a
$
0.000
million
bond
issue
that
was
approved
by
residents
in
February
0000
.

Extracurricular
activities
Asher
School
,
the
Indians
,
participates
in
baseball
,
softball
and
men
and
women
's
basketball
.

Probably
no
small
town
is
known
as
well
for
a
sport
than
Asher
is
.

For
forty
years
,
from
0000
to
0000
,
Asher
had
the
winningest
high
school
baseball
team
in
the
nation
,
led
by
head
coach
Murl
Bowen
.

In
those
forty
years
,
Asher
won
0,000
games
,
lost
only
000
,
hauled
home
forty-five
state
championship
trophies
,
fourteen
state
runner-ups
,
and
sent
dozens
of
players
to
college
and
minor-league
baseball
.

No
high
school
in
history
,
public
or
private
,
has
won
as
many
games
as
the
Asher
Indians
.

A
book
was
written
about
a
man
whom
once
played
baseball
for
the
Asher
Indians
,
called
The
Innocent
Man
:
Murder
and
Injustice
in
a
Small
Town
,
although
the
book
was
not
written
about
him
playing
ball
for
the
Indians
.

The
baseball
field
in
Asher
was
named
after
Murl
Bowen
for
all
the
winnings
he
led
Asher
to
in
his
coaching
years
that
he
was
there
,
and
his
ever-lasting
impression
that
he
left
on
all
Asher
citizens
.

Up
to
this
date
,
even
after
slipping
into
retirement
,
you
can
still
see
Mr.
Murl
Bowen
at
the
schools
basketball
games
and
boys
baseball
games
.

Asher
also
has
chapters
of
the
Business
Professionals
of
America
(
BPA
)

Family
,
Career
,
and
Community
Leaders
of

)
and

is
a
town
in
Pottawatomie
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

It
is
one
of
the
thirteen
existing
all-black
towns
in
Oklahoma
.

The
population
was
00
at
the
0000
census
,
a
00
percent
decline
from
00
at
the
0000
census
.

History
One
of
more
than
fifty
All-Black
towns
of
Oklahoma
,
Brooksville
is
one
of
only
thirteen
still
existing
at
the
beginning
of
the
twenty-first
century
.

Located
in
Pottawatomie
County
four
miles
southwest
of
Tecumseh
,
Brooksville
was
established
in
0000
.

Originally
the
town
was
named
Sewell
,
after
a
white
doctor
who
owned
much
of
the
surrounding
land
and
attended
the
residents
.

In
0000
the
name
changed
to
Brooksville
in
honor
of
the
first
African
American
in
the
area
,
A.
R.
Brooks
,
a
cotton
buyer
and
farmer
.

His
son
,
W.
M.
Brooks
,
became
the
first
postmaster
.

In
0000
Rev.
Jedson
White
organized
St.
John
's
Baptist
Church
.

Soon
afterward
,
the
congregation
built
a
church
that
still
exists
.

White
also
promoted
the
town
throughout
the
South
,
urging
African
Americans
to
settle
in
Brooksville
.

Brooksville
had
a
Santa
Fe
Railroad
station
,
three
hotels
,
two
doctors
,
and
two
mills
.

In
0000
,
with
the
aid
of
the
Rosenwald
Fund
,
a
new
school
was
built
.

Banneker
School
,
under
management
of
W.
T.
McKenzie
,
was
a
rock
building
of
four
large
rooms
,
a
three-hundred-seat
auditorium
,
a
small
library
,
and
a
well-equipped
domestic
science
room
.

George
W.
McLaurin
,
the
first
African
American
graduate
student
at
the
University
of
Oklahoma
,
taught
at
the
school
.

After
a
fire
,
the
original
building
was
replaced
by
a
wooden
one
that
served
students
until
the
school
closed
in
0000
.

The
building
then
became
a
community
center
for
the
town
and
stands
next
to
the
new
city
hall
.

A
declining
cotton
market
and
the
Great
Depression
made
life
difficult
in
Brooksville
,
as
in
many
Oklahoma
communities
.

Most
of
the
residents
departed
,
but
the
town
survived

Earlsboro
is
a
town

County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States

at

0000
census
,
a
decline
of
0.0
percent
from
000
at

It
was
once
called
"
...
the
town
that

built
and
oil
broke
.
"

History
The
town
of
Earlsborough
(
as
it
was
spelled
on
the
town
plat
)
began
in
0000
,
when
the
Choctaw
Coal
and
Railway
(
later
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
)
built
a
line
west
from
the
Seminole
Nation
into
Oklahoma
Territory
.

The
town
was
located
one-half
mile
inside
Oklahoma
Territory
.

It
was
named
for
James
Earls
,
a
local
African
American
who
had
served
as
an
orderly
for
Confederate
General
Joseph
Wheeler
during
the
Civil
War
.

The
spelling
of
the
town
name
changed
when
the
Earlsboro
post
office
opened
on
June
00
,
0000
.

The
town
had
an
economic
boom
from
the
outset
because
Indian
Territory
was
legally
"
dry
,
"
bot
Oklahoma
Territory
was
not
.

The
first
three
businesses
were
saloons
,
and
it
was
said
that
00
percent
of
the
merchants
were
engaged
in
liquor
sales
.

By
0000
,
the
town
had
a
population
estimated
at
000
.

Many
customers
were
visitors
from
Indian
Territory
.

Statehood
brought
prohibition
to
all
of
Oklahoma
,
and
the
population
of
Earlsboro
quickly
dropped
to
000
.

The
local
economy
relied
on
agriculture
instead
of
liquor
.

Oil
was
struck
nearby
on
March
0
,
0000
.

The
first
well
produced
000
barrels
a
day
.

News
of
the
strike
attracted
workers
,
and
the
town
population
increased
to
an
estimated
ten
thousand
people
within
two
months
.

The
ensuing
boom
led
to
construction
of
a
one
hundred
thousand
dollar
hotel
,
a
large
theater
,
and
many
different
kinds
of
business
.

In
0000
,
the
town
passed
a
$
000,000
bond
issue
to
construct
a
water
and
sewer
system
.

The
population
was
officially
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
oil
boom
turned
into
a
bust
when
production
declined
precipitously
in
0000
.

The
newcomers
,
now
deeply
in
debt
,
fled
the
scene
,
abandoning
homes
and
businesses
.

The
city
went
into
bankruptcy
,
since
it
could
no
longer
pay
its
debts
.

In
0000
the
Daily
Oklahoman
reported
that
Earlsboro
"
was
the
town
that
whisky
built
and
oil
broke
.
"

The
population
continued
to
decline
until
the
end
of
the
00th
Century
.

Pink
is
a
town
in
Pottawatomie
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
,
and
is
part
of
the
Oklahoma
City
Metropolitan
Area
.

The

,
a

increase
from

History
Treaties
were
made
with
the
Sac
&
Fox
,
Iowa
,
Citizen
Potawatomi
and
Absentee
Shawnee
to
open
settlement
of
their
"
surplus
"
lands
on
September
00
,
0000
at
00
o'clock
noon
by
proclamation
of
President
Benjamin
Harrison
.

This
was
the
second
land
run
in
Oklahoma
,
opening
0000
homesteads
of
000
acres
each
in
what
would
become
Lincoln
and
Pottawatomie
counties
.

The
claimant
for
each
homestead
was
required
to
pay
$
0.00
per
acre
upon
filing
a
claim
in
Guthrie
or
Oklahoma
City
.

The
Citizen
Potawatomi
and
Absentee
Shawnee
had
been
paid
by
the
US
Government
sixty-nine
cents
for
each
acre
that
would
become
the
town
of
Pink
.

The
town
of
Pink
emerged
sometime
after
the
land
run
and
before
January
0000
when
the
United
States
Post
Office
Department
designated
the
Pink
post
office
to
be
operated
by
Joseph
Fahnestock
.

For
some
reason
Fahnestock
declined
his
appointment
as
postmaster
,
however
the
next
month
Thomas
M
McKittrick
accepted
the
postmaster
job
.

The
post
office
was
discontinued
in
January
0000
,
restablished
in
0000
,
just
to
be
discontinued
permanently
in
February
0000
.

The
Tecumseh
post
office
now
serves
the
town
.

In
the
early
years
W.
R.
Stapp
operated
a
gristmill
and
O.
A.
Miller
ran
a
general
store
.

As
indicated
by

Topographic
Map
,
the
town
center
was
located
just
east
of
what
is

The
town
of
Pink
was
incorporated
in
the
late
0000s
.

In

a

station
were
built
on
Pink
Lane
at
Okay
Road
.

According
to
the
Encyclopedia
of
Oklahoma
History
and
Culture
,
the
town
name
may
have
been
chosen
because
there
was
another
town
named
Brown
,
in
the

Washington
Irving
,
famous
American
author
,
visited
Indian
Territory
in
the
autumn
of
0000
,
passing
through
what
would
become
the
town
of
Pink
on
November
0
,
0000
.

His
travels
were
chronicled
in
A
Tour
of
the
Prairies
in
which
he
described
the
Cross
Timbers
:
"
The
Cross
Timber
is
about
forty
miles
in
breadth
,
and
stretches
over
a
rough
country
of
rolling
hills
,
covered
with
scattered
tracts
of
post-oak
and
black-jack
;
with
some
intervening
valleys
,
which
,
at
proper
seasons
,
would
afford
good
pasturage
.

It
is
very
much
cut
up
by
deep
ravines
,
which
,
in
the
rainy
seasons
,
are
the
beds
of
temporary
streams
,
tributary
to
the
main
rivers
,
and
these
are
called
'
branches
.
'

The
whole
tract
may
present
a
pleasant
aspect
in
the
fresh
time
of
the
year
,
when
the
ground
is
covered
with
herbage
;
when
the
trees
are
in
their
green
leaf
,
and
the
glens
are
enlivened
by
running
streams
.

Unfortunately
,
we
entered
it
too
late
in
the
season
The
herbage
was
parched
;
the
foliage
of
the
scrubby
forests
was
withered
;
the
whole
woodland
prospect
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
had
a
brown
and
arid
hue
.

The
fires
made
on
the
prairies
by
the
Indian
hunters
,
had
frequently
penetrated
these
forests
,
sweeping
in
light
transient
flames
along
the
dry
grass
,
scorching
and
calcining
the
lower
twigs
and
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
leaving
them
black
and
hard
,
so
as
to
tear
the
flesh
of
man
and
horse
that
had
to
scramble
through
them
.

I
shall
not
easily
forget
the
mortal
toil
,
and
the
vexations
of
flesh
and
spirit
,
that
we
underwent
occasionally
,
in
our
wanderings
through
the
Cross
Timber
.

It
was
like
struggling
through
forests
of
cast
iron
.

History
The
area
surrounding
Shawnee
was
settled
after
the
American
Civil
War
by
a
number
of
tribes
that
the
federal
government
had
removed
to
Indian
Territory
.

The
Sac
and
Fox
originally
were
deeded
land
in
the
immediate
area
but
were
soon
followed
by
the
Kickapoo
,
Shawnee
,
and
Pottawatomi
Indians
.

Members
of
the
tribes
continue
to
reside
today
in
and
around
Shawnee
.

Over
the
course
of
the
0000s
,
Texas
cattle
drovers
pushed
their
herds
across
Indian
Territory
;
there
were
four
major
trails
,
with
the
West
Shawnee
trail
crossing
near
present-day
Kickapoo
and
Main
Streets
.

With
the
cattle
drives
came
railroads
;
as
a
result
,
pressure
began
to
build
to
allow
permanent
white
settlements
in
a
region
that
previously
had
been
reserved
by
treaty
to
Native
Americans
.

The
one
other
event
that
foreshadowed
the
coming
of
white
civilization
was
the
establishment
in
0000
of
the
Quaker
mission
near
the
current
Mission
Hill
Hospital
,
where
an
old
building
still
marks
the
spot
.

That
first
missionary
,
Joseph
Newsom
,
opened
a
school
in
0000
,
and
by
0000
a
post
office
and
trading
post
had
been
established
a
quarter
mile
west
of
the
mission
at
what
became
known
as
Shawnee
Town
.

Beginning
in
April
0000
,
the
United
States
government
succumbed
to
the
pressure
that
had
built
to
open
Native
lands
to
white
settlement
.

Land
runs
were
initiated
after
tribal
property
was
seized
and
then
allotted
individually
to
tribal
members
.

After
the
Land
Run
of
0000
,
four
settlers
(
Etta
B.
Ray
,
Henry
G.
Beard
,
James
T.
Farrall
,
and
Elijah
A.
Alley
)
each
staked
a
quarter
section
in
the
proposed
city
of
Brockway
.

Following
an
all-night
discussion
among
early
settlers
who
had
their
own
ideas
for
the
town
's
name
,
a
compromise
was
reached
,
and
the
town
was
named
Shawnee
after
the
American
Indian
Tribe
.

The
quarter
section
of
land
on
which
the
original
city
was
built
,
was
entered
by
Henry
G.
Beard
,
in
0000
.

In
the
early
spring
of
0000
,
Mr.
Beard
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
promoters
of
the
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
Company
,
then
extending
its
line
from
Memphis
,
Tennessee
,
to
Amarillo
,
Texas
,
to
build
through
his
farm
,
and
in
consideration
he
gave
the
railway
company
one-half
his
claim
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
.

The
road
was
accordingly
built
through
his
farm
,
and
the
City
of
Shawnee
began
on
July
0
,
0000
.

For
the
first
few
years
of
the
new
century
,
Shawnee
was
in
the
midst
of
a
boom
that
came
close
to
keeping
pace
with
Oklahoma
City
's
.

Located
in
the
heart
of
cotton
,
potato
,
and
peach
country
,
Shawnee
quickly
became
an
agricultural
center
.

By
0000
,
there
were
seven
cotton
gins
in
the
immediate
area
and
two
cotton
compresses
.

Between
March
0000
and
March
0000
,
000
railroad
cars
of
cotton
product
were
shipped
out
of
Shawnee
,
along
with
000,000
bales
of
cotton
.

Feed
stores
,
wagon
yards
,
an
overall
factory
,
and
an
assortment
of
other
businesses
designed
to
serve
the
farmer
as
they
brought
their
crops
to
market
arose
in
Shawnee
.

The
population
grew
from
000
to
0,000
from
0000
to
0000
.

In
0000-0000
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
and
Santa
Fe
Railway
and
Missouri
,
Kansas
and
Texas
Railway
extended
service
to
town
,
after
given
land
inducements
from
Henry
Beard
and
James
Farrall
.

Oklahoma
Baptist
University
opened
in
0000
.

Its
first
building
,
Shawnee
Hall
,
was
a
gift
from
the
citizens
.

St.
Gregory
's
College
(
now
St.
Gregory
's
University
)
relocated
to
Shawnee
from
Sacred
Heart
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
voters
elected
to
move
the
county
seat
of
Pottawatomie
County
from
Tecumseh
to
Shawnee
.

The
courthouse
was
built
with
New
Deal
funding
,
and
opened
in
0000
.

The
Second
World
War
,
and
in
particular
the
construction
of
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
east
of
Oklahoma
City
,
benefited
Shawnee
's
economy
.

At
various
times
,
Tinker
has
employed
as
many
as
0,000
Shawnee
residents
.

After
the
war
,
three
major
manufacturing
concerns
were
important
for
Shawnee
's
economic
health
.

Jonco
,
Inc.
,
manufactured
aviation
products
and
employed
nearly
0,000
in
0000
.

The
Sylvania
Corporation
produced
vacuum
tube
s
and
electrical
parts
in
its
Shawnee
plant
and
employed
another
0,000
.

The
Shawnee
Milling
Company
,
which
had
rebuilt
after
a
fire
in
the
0000s
,
employed
nearly
000
workers
.

Fairly
stagnant
until
the
0000s
,
Shawnee
's
economic
climate
improved
with
the
addition
of
a
number
of
industrial
plants
north
of
the
city
which
added
approximately
0,000
jobs
to
the
community
base
.

Historic
Downtown
Shawnee
Downtown
Shawnee
is
an
excellent
example
of
many
Main
Street
communities
that
emerged
in
the
late
00th
century
as
part
of
the
westward
movement
.

Choosing
not
to
organize
its
activity
around
a
central
square
,
as
did
many
towns
in
New
England
,
the
South
,
and
upper-Midwest
,
Shawnee
represents
a
distinctly
western
model
of
urban
development
.

Depending
on
railroad
lines
for
its
economic
health
,
Shawnee
's
Main
Street
became
the
focal
point
for
commercial
,
manufacturing
,
and
entertainment
activity
beginning
in
0000
,
four
years
after
the
region
was
opened
for
white
settlement
in
a
land
run
.

Competing
with
Oklahoma
City
in
order
to
be
the
hub
of
central
Oklahoma
,
Shawnee
developed
a
fairly
broad
base
of
economic
activity
.

As
late
as
0000
,
city
leaders
hoped
that
one
more
rail
line
,
a
meat
packing
plant
,
and
the
state
capital
might
be
just
enough
to
surge
ahead
of
its
rival
00
miles
to
the
west
.

However
,
Shawnee
came
in
a
distant
third
in
the
statewide
election
to
determine
the
capital
,
and
lost
both
the
railway
and
the
meatpacking
plant
to
Oklahoma
City
.

The
setbacks
perhaps
insured
,
however
,
that
Shawnee
would
be
primarily
a
small
city
built
around
the
activity
of
Main
Street
.

Shawnee
's
early
economic
success
was
developed
around
the
railroad
industry
.

The
Santa
Fe
Train
Depot
(
still
extant
)
,
with
its
unique
architecture
,
serves
as
a
visible
reminder
of
the
city
's
dependence
on
the
train
.

During
the
early
00th
century
,
the
Rock
Island
Railroad
and
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
both
had
depots
in
the
city
.

Shawnee
's
major
employer
was
the
Rock
Island
Railroad
,
which
had
located
its
main
southwestern
repair
shops
in
the
city
in
0000
;
the
shops
were
removed
to
El
Reno
in
0000
,
but
two
major
buildings
remain
.

The
Santa
Fe
Railroad
also
had
repair
shops
just
south
of
the
city
;
only
a
large
concrete
tower
remained
until
0000
when
it
was
removed
.

Serving
as
the
region
's
agricultural
hub
during
much
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
00th
century
,
Shawnee
provided
the
markets
for
significant
numbers
of
farmers
to
sell
their
crops
.

Cotton
was
a
major
crop
and
Main
Street
was
often
lined
with
bales
;
mule
sellers
,
peanut
vendors
,
and
peach
growers
all
came
to
Shawnee
.

The
building
which
was
reputed
to
be
the
largest
cottonseed
oil
mill
in
the
Southwest
is
still
extant
;
this
same
building
later
was
turned
into
a
peanut
factory
.

Seven
cotton
gin
s
could
be
found
in
the
city
,
including
the
first
electric
gin
in
the
state
,
which
is
still
extant
.

The
Shawnee
Flouring
Mill
has
been
a
major
part
of
the
city
's
economic
history
and
still
dominates
the
skyline
of
the
downtown
core
.

The
existing
building
was
rebuilt
after
a
fire
in
0000
.

Near
Main
Street
are
a
coal
gasification
plant
that
dates
to
0000
and
a
grain
elevator
that
dates
to
the
0000s
.

In
0000
Main
Street
was
dominated
by
small
retail
establishments
of
which
approximately
00
percent
are
housed
in
buildings
that
were
built
prior
to
statehood
in
0000
.

The
large
majority
of
these
buildings
have
had
their
facades
significantly
altered
in
order
to
adjust
to
the
changing
tastes
in
the
00th
century
.

Yet
there
is
one
block
(
between
Philadelphia
and
Union
streets
)
that
remains
substantially
unaltered
from
the
turn
of
the
century
.

This
block
serves
as
a
reminder
of
how
life
on
Main
Street
functioned
prior
to
statehood
;
the
buildings
still
house
a
hardware
store
,
a
western
wear
store
,
and
a
furniture
store
.

On
another
block
further
west
at
Broadway
and
Main
stands
,
in
virtually
unaltered
condition
,
Shawnee
's
most
famous
department
store
,
which
was
constructed
in
0000
.

The
Mammoth
(
currently
Neal
's
Home
Furnishings
)
continues
to
remind
residents
of
the
high
level
of
retail
activity
of
early
Shawnee
residents
.

Before
World
War
II
,
Main
Street
had
numerous
drugstores
and
soda
fountain
s
that
served
as
the
social
gathering
places
for
young
people
.

Today
,
the
Owl
Drug
,
which
is
in
a
building
that
has
been
a
drugstore
since
0000
,
retains
many
of
the
old
fixtures
and
,
appears
much
as
it
did
during
the
00th
Century
.

The
variety
of
resources
on
and
adjacent
to
Main
Street
is
reflected
in
two
hotels
;
the
first
,
the
Norwood
,
was
built
in
0000
and
remained
substantially
unaltered
until
it
was
destroyed
.

People
through
the
0000s
would
take
the
train
to
Shawnee
,
stay
in
the
Norwood
,
and
shop
in
the
stores
on
Main
Street
.

Unfortunately
,
the
Norwood
was
struck
by
a
small
tornado
in
0000
and
was
subsequently
demolished
.

A
small
park
now
occupies
where
the
Norwood
once
stood
on
the
northwest
corner
of
Broadway
and
Main
.

The
second
hotel
,
the
Aldridge
(
currently
a
retirement
center
for
senior
citizens
)
,
built
in
0000
at
the
northwest
corner
of
0th
and
Bell
streets
,
was
a
result
of
the
wealth
and
growth
generated
by
the
oil
boom
of
the
0000s
,
as
was
the
four-story
Masonic
Temple
Office
Building
,
which
was
constructed
in
0000
directly
south
of
the
Alridge
Hotel
.

The
one
other
building
that
was
constructed
during
the
height
of
the
oil
boom
in
Shawnee
was
the
State
National
Bank
on
Main
Street
.

The
bank
fell
victim
to
the
Depression
in
the
0000s
,
but
the
building
currently
houses
a
number
of
retail
businesses
and
is
known
as
the
Mini-Mall
.

Main
Street
has
had
a
number
of
entertainment
facilities
.

A
convention
hall
attracted
well-known
celebrities
of
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
such
as
Sarah
Bernhardt
,
and
an
opera
house
on
Market
and
Main
was
the
site
of
many
memorable
events
.

The
best
example
still
extant
is
the
Ritz
Theater
,
which
was
the
oldest
continuously
operating
theater
in
Oklahoma
until
the
theater
's
closure
in
0000
.

Another
building
still
extant
was
the
Bison
Theater
on
the
southwest
corner
of
Philadelphia
and
Main
streets
.

Today
,
the
Bison
Theater
functions
as
an
antique
shop
and
recording
studio
.

Downtown
Shawnee
has
lost
many
buildings
of
historical
value
,
but
still
retains
a
significant
number
of
resources
that
continue
to
provide
a
living
reminder
of
how
Main
Street
functioned
for
many
Americans
in
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
.

Santa
Fe
Depot
Located
at
000
E.
Main
in
Shawnee
is
a
unique
railroad
depot
made
of
limestone
blocks
two
to
three-feet
deep
.

With
a
00
ft.
turret
,
it
takes
on
the
slight
appearance
of
a
castle
,
contrasting
with
the
surrounding
architecture
.

It
was
built
in
0000
and
was
placed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

The
Pottawatomie
County
Historical
Society
began
restoration
of
this
depot
in
0000
,
after
it
had
stood
vacant
for
two
decades
.

The
building
was
remodeled
into
a
railroad
and
countywide
museum
,
which
opened
on
May
00
,
0000
.

It
contains
numerous
historical
artifacts
from
the
settlement
of
Shawnee
,
and
also
contains
railroad
memorabilia
,
and
a
gift
shop
.

Benson
Park
Benson
Park
was
located
approximately
midway
between
Shawnee
and
Tecumseh
,
and
served
the
recreational
needs
of
Shawnee
residents
for
most
of
00
years
.

What
made
the
park
unique
was
the
interurban
streetcar
that
ran
between
the
two
towns
to
the
park
.

Opened
in
0000
,
the
park
had
a
swimming
pool
,
skating
rink
,
roller
coaster
,
and
large
picnic
areas
.

,
the
space
that
was
once
the
park
is
currently
occupied
by
a
large
pecan
orchard
and
located
at
00000
Benson
Park
Rd.
.

Pottawatomie
County
Seat
dispute
The
cities
of
Shawnee
and
Tecumseh
,
a
city
seven
miles
south
of
Shawnee
,
have
been
involved
in
a
series
of
controversial
elections
to
determine
which
city
would
be
the
county
seat
of
Pottawatomie
County
.

In
0000
,
0,000
people
wanted
the
government
moved
to
Shawnee
and
0,000
wanted
it
to
remain
in
Tecumseh
,
but
the
case
was
appealed
and
the
higher
courts
decided
bribery
had
figured
in
the
election
.

Shawnee
had
offered
use
of
the
currently
known
as
Woodland
Park
as
a
court
house
site
.

In
0000
,
the
people
of
the
Pottawatomie
County
went
to
the
polls
and
giving
Tecumseh
the
majority
by
0,000
to
0,000
until
October
0000
when
0,000
signatures
were
petitioned
to
ask
Governor
William
J.
Holloway
for
a
county
seat
ballot
.

A
special
election
was
held
December
00
,
when
00,000
voters
,
a
record
number
,
marched
to
the
polls
.

Shawnee
won
the
necessary
two-thirds
majority
by
a
00
vote
margin
.

A
recount
cut
this
to
00
.

Tecumseh
charged
a
$
00,000
slush
fund
,
liquor
at
the
polls
,
voting
of
college
boys
,
etc.
.

The
Supreme
Court
this
time
favored
Shawnee
and
for
several
years
county
officers
transacted
business
in
downtown
Shawnee
buildings
.

In
0000
,
the
New
Deal
helped
with
money
to
lend
and
the
present
court
house
was
built
in
Shawnee
in
Woodland
Veteran
's
Memorial
Park
.

July
0
,
0000
,
Governor
E.W.
Marland
dedicated
the
new
building
.

Since
Tecumseh
was
originally
the
county
seat
,
a
brick
courthouse
was
built
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
when
Tecumseh
lost
the
county
seat
status
to
Shawnee
,
The
Tecumseh
City
Hall
now
stands
on
that
location
.

Albion
is
a
town
in
Pushmataha
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
A
United
States
Post
Office
opened
at
Albion
,
Indian
Territory
on
December
0
,
0000
and
is
still
in
operation
.

Prior
to
Oklahoma
's
statehood
Albion
was
located
in
Wade
County
,
Choctaw
Nation
.

In
its
early
days
Albion
—
named
by
John
T.
Bailey
,
an
Englishman
,
using
the
[
Ancient
Greek
]
name
for
England
—
was
a
sawmill
town
in
the
Indian
Territory
.

Later
it
became
a
trading
center
in
an
agricultural
region
in
which
cotton
and
other
crops
were
grown
.

During
the
0000s
the
St.
Louis-San
Francisco
Railway
,
more
popularly
known
as
the
“
Frisco
”
,
built
a
line
from
north
to
south
through
the
Choctaw
Nation
,
connecting
Fort
Smith
,
Arkansas
with
Paris
,
Texas
.

The
railroad
paralleled
the
Kiamichi
River
throughout
much
of
its
route
in
present-day
Pushmataha
County
,
Oklahoma
.

Train
stations
were
established
every
few
miles
to
aid
in
opening
up
the
land
and
,
more
particularly
,
to
serve
as
the
locations
of
section
houses
.

Supervisors
for
their
respective
miles
of
track
lived
in
the
section
houses
to
administer
the
track
and
its
right-of-way
.

These
stations
also
served
as
points
at
which
the
trains
could
draw
water
.

The
site
of
Albion
was
selected
because
of
its
proximity
to
the
Kiamichi
River
,
with
its
abundant
water
supply
.

Adjacent
station
stops
were
established
at
Talihina
,
Oklahoma
to
the
north
,
and
Kiamichi
,
Oklahoma
to
the
south
.

The
sparsely
populated
area
,
at
that
time
known
as
Wade
County
,
Choctaw
Nation
,
in
the
Indian
Territory
,
was
home
to
Choctaw
Indians
who
farmed
or
subsisted
on
the
land
.

Few
roads
or
trails
existed
.

Transportation
was
provided
by
the
Frisco
Railroad
,
which
offered
six
trains
per
day
—
three
in
each
direction
—
until
it
closed
to
passenger
traffic
during
the
late
0000s
.

It
continued
freight
operations
until
0000
,
when
it
closed
altogether
and
its
rails
were
removed
.

The
loss
of
passenger
rail
fortunately
coincided
with
the
construction
of
U.S.
Highway
000
.

Albion
has
more
in
common
economically
with
Talihina
,
Oklahoma
,
the
town
to
its
north
.

Planners
of
the
proposed
State
of
Sequoyah
,
who
in
0000
proposed
a
state
to
be
formed
from
the
Indian
Territory
,
realized
this
,
and
called
for
Albion
to
be
the
southernmost
town
in
a
county
,
Wade
County
,
which
was
also
to
include
Talihina
and
towns
to
its
north
,
and
stretch
far
to
the
north
and
west
.

Instead
,
Sequoyah
was
not
admitted
to
the
Union
by
Congress
,
and
in
the
State
of
Oklahoma
which
followed
it
Albion
became
the
northeastern-most
town
of
a
county
whose
geographic
and
population
centers
are
far
to
Albion
’s
southwest
.

Albion
prospered
during
its
first
few
decades
.

Most
business
was
centered
around
a
town
square
,
with
residential
neighborhoods
ringing
it
.

During
recent
decades
,
however
,
it
has
diminished
greatly
.

United
States
Census
returns
show
it
dropping
from
a
high
of
000
residents
in
0000
to
just
00
in
0000
.

More
information
on
Albion
may
be
found
in
the
Pushmataha
County
Historical
Society
.

Albion
became
home
to
an
internationally
known
poet
and
author
when
Mato
Kosyk
,
or
Kossick
,
moved
to
the
town
in
0000
.

Locating
there
because
its
climate
was
considered
healthy
and
its
views
of
the
Kiamichi
Mountains
were
scenic
,
Kosyk
lived
for
the
next
00
years
there
,
until
his
death
in
0000
.

Kosyk
,
a
Lutheran
minister
,
immigrated
to
the
United
States
from
Werben
,
Lower
Lusatia
,
Germany
in
0000
.

He
is
considered
one
of
the
most
significant
writers
in
Sorbian
,
a
Slavic
language
,
and
his
000th
birthday
was
celebrated
by
his
followers
in
Europe
in
0000
.

Unfortunately
Kosyk
may
not
have
fared
well
during
his
years
in
Albion
;
according
to
accounts
he
was
swindled
and
defrauded
by
unscrupulous
residents
.

During
recent
years
the
Mato
Kosyk
House
in
Albion
has
been
entered
into
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

It
is
considered
significant
in
being
the
only
surviving
structure
associated
with
the
famous
poet
.

The
post
office
in
Albion
was
slated
for
possible
closure
by
the
US
Postal
service
in
0000
.

History
Evidence
exists
of
prehistoric
activity
within
the
city
limits
of
present-day
Antlers
.

Arrowhead
s
are
found
periodically
at
sites
throughout
the
town
.

Most
of
the
prehistoric
sites
are
atop
hills
,
which
the
prehistoric
inhabitants
found
the
most
healthful
.

Antlers
and
the
rest
of
the
Kiamichi
River
valley
fell
within
the
realm
of
the
American
Indian
culture
based
at
Spiro
Mounds
.

The
Mississippian
culture
based
there
controlled
a
large
portion
of
what
is
now
southeastern
Oklahoma
and
adjacent
states
.

More
recently
,
nomadic
Caddo
Indians
roamed
the
area
.

Rarely
establishing
permanent
settlements
,
they
were
highly
mobile
and
hunted
and
fished
across
the
region
.

The
area
that
is
now
Antlers
was
granted
to
the
Choctaw
Indians
in
0000
by
the
Treaty
of
Dancing
Rabbit
Creek
.

During
the
0000s
the
St.
Louis-San
Francisco
Railway
,
more
popularly
known
as
the
“
Frisco
"
,
built
a

.

The
railroad
paralleled
the
Kiamichi
River
throughout
much
of
its
route
in
present-day
Pushmataha
County
,
Oklahoma
.

Train
stations
were
established
every
few
miles
to
aid
in
opening
up
the
land
and
,
more
particularly
,
to
serve
as
the
locations
of
section
houses
.

Supervisors
for
their
respective
miles
of
track
lived
in
the
section
houses
to
administer
the
track
and
its
right-of-way
.

These
stations
also
served
as
points
at
which
the
trains
could
draw
water
.

The
site
of
Antlers
was
selected
for
a
station
due
to
the
existence
of
a
freshwater
spring
.

Adjacent
stations
were
established
at
Davenport
—
now
Kellond
,
Oklahoma
—
to
the
north
,
and
Hamden
,
Oklahoma
to
the
south
.

The
sparsely
populated
area
,
at
that
time
known
as
Jack
’s
Fork
County
of
the
Choctaw
Nation
,
in
the
Indian
Territory
,
was
home
to
Choctaw
Indians
who
farmed
or
subsisted
on
the
land
.

Few
roads
or
trails
existed
.

Transportation
was
provided
by
the
Frisco
Railroad
,
which
offered
six
trains
per
day
(
three
in
each
direction
)
until
it
closed
to
passenger
traffic
during
the
mid
0000
's
.

It
continued
freight
operations
until
0000
,
when
it
closed
altogether
and
its
rails
were
removed
.

The
loss
of
passenger
rail
coincided
with
the
construction
of
several
highways
linking
Antlers
to
other
communities
,
including
U.S.
Highway
000
,
Oklahoma
State
Highway
0
,
and
Oklahoma
State
Highway
0
.

The
southern
section
of
the
Indian
Nation
Turnpike
,
which
has
an
interchange
at
Antlers
,
opened
in
0000
.

Antlers
was
given
its
name
due
to
the
presence
of
large
antlers
,
or
the
horns
of
bucks
,
nailed
to
nearby
trees
,
ostensibly
to
mark
the
site
of
the
spring
.

A
United
States
Post
Office
was
established
at
Antlers
'
Indian
Territory
on
August
00
,
0000
.

According
to
early
settler
Colonel
Victor
M.
Locke
,
Jr.
,
a
hunter
was
encamped
at
the
spring
at
present-day
Antlers
early
one
autumn
and
killed
a
“
magnificent
buck
.

”
He
nailed
its
antlers
on
a
tree
close
to
the
spring
as
a
challenge
to
other
hunters
,
who
followed
suit
.

Railroad
officials
later
designated
their
new
station
stop
as
“
Antlers
”
in
recognition
of
this
prominent
local
landmark
.

American
settlers
from
the
United
States
lived
in
Antlers
and
surrounding
areas
at
the
discretion
of
the
Choctaw
government
,
which
afforded
the
settlers
no
protections
or
government
services
of
any
kind
,
and
during
the
0000s
the
U.S.
government
acted
to
provide
a
minimal
level
of
support
.

It
established
Recording
Districts
throughout
all
Five
Civilized
Tribes
of
the
Indian
Territory
.

Antlers
became
Record
Town
of
Recording
District
#
00
,
which
covered
almost
all
of
present-day
Pushmataha
,
Choctaw
and
McCurtain
counties
.

American
citizens
living
in
this
area
now
had
the
rudiments
of
a
justice
system
available
.

To
support
the
needs
of
a
Record
Town
,
a
United
States
Court
was
established
at
Antlers
.

A
large
wooden
courthouse
was
built
to
accommodate
the
justices
,
lawyers
and
courtroom
facilities
necessary
,
and
Antlers
became
home
to
a
small
government
outpost
.

During
the
waning
days
of
the
Indian
Territory
the
Republican
Party
was
in
power
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
so
the
justices
,
sheriffs
,
deputies
,
and
court
clerks
were
all
Republican
.

Local
residents
,
being
from
former
Confederate
States
,
were
almost
all
Democrats
.

In
order
to
prepare
for
Oklahoma
's
statehood
,
the
United
States
Government
surveyed
and
plotted
every
town
of
significance
.

Antlers
was
surveyed
in
0000
and
a
townsite
of
was
mapped
.

Once
the
area
was
included
in
a
state
,
residents
could
establish
formal
ownership
of
their
homes
and
property
.

Upon
the
advent
of
Oklahoma
's
statehood
on
November
00
,
0000
,
the
Choctaw
Nation
and
the
Indian
Territory
ceased
to
exist
.

Antlers
lost
its
prized
status
as
a
United
States
Court
town
and
the
complexion
of
the
town
’s
population
changed
as
those
who
worked
in
the
“
cottage
industry
”
which
had
arisen
to
support
the
Court
left
in
pursuit
of
other
employment
.

Antlers
’
then
served
as
local
resort
town
,
as
it
is
a
gateway
to
the
Kiamichi
Mountains
,
and
many
tourists
came
to
fish
,
hunt
,
and
relax
in
the
town
and
nearby
mountains
.

Many
came
from
Paris
,
Texas
.

Sustained
growth
occurred
for
several
decades
,
until
April
00
,
0000
,
when
Antlers
was
devastated
by
a
powerful
tornado
.

Moving
southeast
to
northwest
,
it
destroyed
stores
and
homes
in
a
wide
swath
,
including
stores
and
shops
at
the
south
end
of
High
Street
.

Sixty-seven
residents
were
killed
,
and
over
000
injured
.

Antlers
High
School
was
established
as
a
makeshift
morgue
to
receive
bodies
.

The
most
significant
destruction
occurred
in
the
000
block
of
East
Main
Street
,
where
the
large
and
historic
St.
Agnes
Academy
for
Choctaw
Indians
was
destroyed
.

Miraculously
,
only
two
lives
were
lost
:
nuns
who
were
killed
by
a
falling
chimney
.

All
of
the
students
survived
.

U.S.
Army
troops
were
dispatched
from
Camp
Maxey
,
Texas
,
a
World
War
II-era
Army
base
located
between
Paris
and
Arthur
City
,
Texas
.

The
troops
assisted
with
rescue
,
maintaining
law
and
order
,
and
clearing
rubble
.

Meteorologists
have
since
retroactively
categorized
the
Antlers
tornado
as
an
F0
on
the
Fujita
Scale
,
the
most
powerful
.

Local
residents
believed
there
were
two
tornados
striking
the
town
,
as
two
funnels
were
claimed
to
have
been
seen
.

The
Antlers
tornado
funnel
measured
a
half-mile
wide
at
its
base
,
and
the
two
funnel
clouds
observed
locally
were
within
the
larger
one
.

The
Antlers
F0
was
so
powerful
that
it
could
be
clearly
heard
,
as
well
as
seen
,
four
miles
(
0
km
)
east
of
town
at
the
Ethel
Road
crossroads
,
and
as
far
north
as
Kosoma
.

After
0000
the
town
paralleled
the
growth
experienced
by
the
United
States
at
large
.

With
the
advent
of
universal
electrical
service
most
homes
came
to
have
air-conditioning
,
and
later
almost
all
had
televisions
.

Social
relations
changed
at
this
point
as
individuals
and
families
found
their
entertainment
indoors
,
rather
than
outdoors
or
downtown
.

The
biggest
change
of
the
post-war
years
occurred
in
0000
,
when
R.C.
Pruett
opened
East
Town
Village
on
the
eastern
outskirts
of
Antlers
.

In
doing
so
,
he
mirrored
a
trend
seen
in
almost
every
town
across
the
country
—
major
retailers
relocated
from
historic
downtowns
to
larger
facilities
on
their
outskirts
.

Pruett
’s
grocery
store
was
a
new
one
,
but
within
a
few
years
merchants
began
deserting
Antlers
’
historic
downtown
for
East
Town
Village
or
other
locations
,
or
closing
altogether
.

At
the
same
time
,
Antlers
residents
began
shopping
at
Wal-Mart
,
which
offered
greater
variety
and
lower
prices
than
Antlers
'
local
merchants
were
able
to
offer
,
and
to
this
day
many
of
its
customers
come
from
Antlers
.

In
recent
years
there
has
been
an
effort
to
declare
Antlers
a
“
Main
Street
USA
”
site
.

Due
to
a
series
of
arson
and
fires
beginning
in
the
0000s
,
Antlers
lost
a
number
of
its
stores
,
changing
the
character
of
its
downtown
.

The
buildings
which
remain
are
sturdy
brick
buildings
with
antique
facades
.

In
recent
years
merchants
have
been
removing
the
0000s-era
awnings
and
other
structures
returning
the
buildings
to
their
original
states
.

During
recent
years
the
Antlers
Frisco
Depot
and
Antlers
Spring
have
been
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
,
in
recognition
of
their
contribution
to
the
architecture
and
history
of
the
town
.

The
architecture
of
the
depot
,
built
in
0000
with
separate
waiting
rooms
and
toilets
for
white
passengers
and
black
passengers
,
pays
homage
to
an
earlier
era
in
which
racial
inequality
and
lack
of
civil
rights
was
institutionalized
into
the
design
of
public
buildings
.

located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to

has
a

land
.

History
Established
in
approximately
0000
,
Rattan
was
named
for
Rattan
,
Texas
,
from
which
a
number
of
its
early
white
settlers
came
.

Rattan
,
Texas
—
located
in
Delta
County
,
thirty
miles
south
of
Paris
,
Texas
--
was
named
for
local
postal
officer
Clarence
V.
Rattan
in
0000
.

Following
Oklahoma
's
statehood
in
0000
a
number
of
Delta
County
families
relocated
to
the
new
Pushmataha
County
,
among
them
Akins
,
Akards
,
and
Helms
.

The
Delta
County
family
(
or
families
)
apparently
establishing
itself
in
Rattan
has
not
been
identified
.

Originally
overshadowed
by
the
nearby
white
settlement
of
Belzoni
,
Oklahoma
,
Rattan
did
not
become
economically
successful
enough
to
merit
its
own
United
States
Post
Office
until
December
00
,
0000
.

Belzoni
’s
success
as
a
farming
hub
sapped
Rattan
of
much
of
its
potential
vitality
,
and
it
was
not
until
the
latter
’s
decline
that
Rattan
emerged
as
the
population
center
of
southeastern
area
of
the
county
.

Prior
to
establishment
of
its
post
office
with
the
name
“
Rattan
”
,
the
area
was
called
Sulphur
Springs
,
Indian
Territory
.

Sulphur
Springs
,
located
0/0
mile
south-southeast
of
the
highway
intersection
of
OK
0
and
OK
00
in
present-day
Rattan
,
was
county
seat
of
Cedar
County
,
Choctaw
Nation
.

It
was
established
by
the
Choctaws
’
Doaksville
Constitution
of
0000
and
,
in
the
manner
of
most
Choctaw
county
seats
,
served
a
part-time
role
as
legal
and
political
center
.

It
was
never
a
sizeable
permanent
settlement
and
boasted
almost
no
mercantile
or
retail
stores
.

County
court
met
on
the
first
Monday
of
each
month
and
was
called
Probate
Court
,
even
though
it
was
more
similar
to
modern-day
county
court
proceedings
than
a
modern
probate
court
.

The
court
met
in
a
large
log
house
,
constructed
of
long
,
straight
logs
,
serving
as
both
an
Indian
Methodist
church
and
court
house
.

The
Cedar
County
Court
House
was
torn
down
by
white
settlers
sometime
after
Oklahoma
’s
statehood
in
0000
,
after
which
it
ceased
serving
any
legal
use
.

The
Court
House
was
located
about
000
yards
north
of
the
Sulphur
Springs
and
0/0
mile
due
west
of
Rattan
Cemetery
.

Sulphur
Springs
took
its
name
from
several
sulphur
springs
located
in
the
vicinity
.

A
number
of
Choctaw
families
living
around
the
Cedar
County
Court
House
used
them
as
well
as
visitors
to
court
.

The
improved
Ft.
Smith
to
Ft.
Towson
military
road
of
0000
passed
along
the
east
side
of
Rattan
(
at
the
water
tower
,
0.00
miles
east
of
the
OK
00
junction
with
OK
0
)
after
crossing
the
"
Seven
Devils
"
on
its
way
southeast
to
Spencer
Academy
and
Doaksville
.

This
wagon
road
was
heavily
used
by
the
U.S.
Army
from
0000-00
,
and
remained
the
main
road
through
Cedar
County
until
the
Frisco
railroad
was
completed
in
0000
from
Ft.
Smith
through
Antlers
to
Paris
,
Texas
.

Natural
resources
were
key
to
Rattan
’s
early
growth
.

Many
of
its
settlers
were
farmers
.

Timber
,
logged
in
the
Kiamichi
Mountains
north
of
the
community
,
also
fueled
growth
.

A
number
of
logging
trams
,
or
railroad
lines
,
were
built
into
the
mountains
and
large
camps
of
loggers
and
their
dependents
lived
along
the
tracks
for
months
on
end
.

These
mobile
,
rolling
communities
were
sizeable
enough
to
feature
small
schools
,
physicians
offices
,
and
general
stores
.

Most
of
their
residents
lived
in
railroad
cars
which
traveled
along
with
the
work
crews
as
they
logged
deeper
into
the
mountains
.

Rattan
became
the
Great
Depression
-
era
recipient
of
a
handsome
public
school
built
by
the
Works
Progress
Administration
.

Constructed
of
native
stone
brought
from
nearby
fields
,
it
continues
in
use
today
.

During
the
0000s
Rattan
incorporated
as
a
town
,
and
offers
rudimentary
public
services
.

School
students
from
Rattan
made
news
headlines
during
0000
as
they
initiated
a
series
of
events
with
international
repercussions
.

During
World
War
II
the
Moyers
area
was
the
site
of
two
lethal
air
crashes
.

British
pilots
operating
from
a
Royal
Air
Force
base
in
Texas
crashed
into
White
Rock
Mountain
and
Big
Mountain
,
killing
four
crew
men
.

Two
planes
were
destroyed
.

A
third
plane
crash-landed
successfully
a
few
miles
northwest
at
Jumbo
.

These
events
had
receded
from
memory
and
were
generally
forgotten
until
a
history
class
in
the
Rattan
Public
School
began
pursuing
information
about
them
.

Their
research
led
them
to
commemorate
the
events
.

On
February
00
,
0000
the
AT0
Monument
was
dedicated
in
the
fliers
'
honor
at
the
crash
site
on
Big
Mountain
.

Over
0,000
people
attended
the
ceremony
,
and
the
story
of
it
and
Rattan
's
intrepid
young
scholars
was
carried
by
the
British
Broadcasting
Corporation
and
many
newspapers
around
the
world
.

At
this
writing
Rattan
features
a
café
,
two
or
three
stores
,
and
several
churches
.

Many
residents
shop
in
Antlers
,
Oklahoma
and
Hugo
,
Oklahoma
—
particularly
in
the
large
Wal-Mart
store
located
in
the
latter
town
.

Rattan
also
is
the
home
of
a
world-famous
PacMan
gamer
,
Blake

,
El
ídolo
,
with
Cuban
actress
Marylin
Pupo
,
playing
Omar
Contreras
(
a.k.a.

Claremore
is
a
city
and
the
county
seat
of
Rogers
County
,

,
United
States
.

at
the

census
,

percent
increase
from

Metropolitan
Area
and
home
to
Rogers
State
University
.

It
is
best
known
as
the

of
entertainer
Will
Rogers
.

History
Around
0000
,
a
band
of
Osage
Indians
settled
in
the
area
of
present-day
Claremore
.

The
town
's
name
came
from
an
Osage
chief
called
"
Gra-moi
.
"

French
traders
in
the
area
pronounced
his
name
as
"
Clairmont
,
"
which
means
"
mountain
with
a
clear
view
.
"

The
Osage
village
was
destroyed
in
0000
,
during
the
Battle
of
Osage
Mound
.

The
area
experienced
some
minor
damage
during
the
American
Civil
War
,
but
quickly
recovered
after
the
end
of
the
conflict
.

After
the
Indian
Removal
Act
of
0000
was
passed
by
the
United
States
,
Claremore
became
part
of
Indian
Territory
and
the
Cherokee
Nation
.

Claremore
was
a
part
of
the
Cooweescoowee
District
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
Cherokee
Nation
.

The
Rogers
family
,
for
whom
the
county
is
named
,
was
among
the
first
settlers
.

Clem
Rogers
,
father
of
the
famous
Will
Rogers
,
who
,
along
with
his
family
,
is
buried
at
the
Will
Rogers
Memorial
,
moved
to
the
county
in
0000
.

His
ranch
eventually
was
more
than
,
and
his
home
,
which
still
stands
outside
Oologah
,
is
an
important
historical
site
.

Clem
Rogers
was
a
major
advocate
of
Oklahoma
statehood
and
was
the
oldest
delegate
to
the
state
's
Constitutional
Convention
in
0000
at
age
00
.

A
post
office
was
established
on
June
00
,
0000
.

The
coming
of
railways
to
Indian
Territory
was
the
driving
factor
in
Claremore
's
early
growth
.

Two
early
lines
intersected
in
the
center
of
town
.

The
name
of
Claremore
changed
from
Clermont
to
its
present
spelling
on
September
00
,
0000
.

A
clerk
recording
the
town
as
having
a
post
office
spelled
the
name
incorrectly
,
and
it
stuck
.

The
city
was
incorporated
in
the
Cherokee
Nation
on
May
0
,
0000
.

Another
major
factor
in
the
growth
of
Claremore
was
an
area
known
as
"
Radium
Town
"
.

In
0000
,
a
man
named
George
Eaton
owned
an
oil
company
in
Claremore
.

He
was
drilling
just
to
the
east
of
Claremore
and
struck
an
underground
pool
of
water
that
smelled
of
sulfur
.

A
local
doctor
,
Dr.
W.G.
Williams
,
tested
the
water
and
marketed
it
as
a
cure
.

The
water
,
known
as
"
Radium
Water
,
"
contained
impurities
that
supposedly
made
it
medically
useful
.

Bath
houses
sprang
up
all
over
this
area
of
Claremore
,
but
only
one
is
still
standing
today
.

Claremore
's
first
hospital
was
established
on
Will
Rogers
Boulevard
,
or
Oklahoma
State
Highway
00
,
in
the
early
0000s
.

Today
it
can
be
seen
with
windows
boarded
up
just
off
the
road
.

Claremore
's
newspaper
,
the
Claremore
Daily
Progress
,
was
established
in
0000
by
cowboy
Joe
Klein
and
is
still
published
daily
.

It
is
the
oldest
business
in
Rogers
County
.

There
are
many
historic
homes
and
other
buildings
in
Claremore
,
including
the
old
business
district
.

In
0000
,
Claremore
's
historic
core
received
a
rebuilding
grant
from
the
state
's
Oklahoma
Main
Street
program
.

Renovation
work
on
the
downtown
was
completed
in
0000
.

The
Rodgers

Black
Fox
Power
Plant
The
Black
Fox
Nuclear
Power
Plant
was
a
nuclear
power
plant
proposed
by
the
Public
Service
Company
of
Oklahoma
(
PSO
)
in
May
0000
.

The
facility
was
to
be
built
approximately
00
miles
outside
of
Inola
,
Oklahoma
,
and
encompass
the
use
of
two
General
Electric
(

)
Boiling
Water
Reactors
.

While
PSO
initially
wooed
the
citizens
of
Inola
with
the
promises
of
economic
growth
and
better
schools
,
after
the
Three
Mile
Island
accident
,
and
accidents
at
the
Browns
Ferry
Nuclear
Power
Plant
,
the
people
became
disillusioned
with
the
idea
of
housing
such
a
facility
in
their
backyards
.

After
nine
years
of
court
battles
,
the
decision
was
abandoned
in
0000
and
no
complex
would
be
built
.

However
,
the
Oklahoma
Corporation
Commission
(
OCC
)
allowed
PSO
to
pass
their
losses
onto
PSO
consumers
with
a
rate
hike
to
replace
the
money
lost
.

Will
Rogers
was
born
on
a
ranch
two

east
of
Oologah
,
though
he
usually
claimed

la
la
is
associated
with
the
tapping
of
a

's
bill
,

is
a

the
Red-Headed
Woodpecker

Notable
natives
and
residents
History
Wewoka
was
originally
named
Wewokea
,
after
the
second
wife
of
Osceola
.

She
was
of
mixed-race
Seminole
and
African
ancestry
.

Gopher
John
named
this
area
to
honor
her
and
Osceola
.

This
land
was
claimed
for
the
mixed-blood
,
Seminole-African
band
of
Wildcat
,
founded
in
0000-00
by
Gopher
John
.

The
right
hand
man
of
Wildcat
,
he
was
also
known
as
Juan
Cavallo
.

He
was
Seminole-African
,
who
helped
relocate
many
Seminoles
to
Oklahoma
.

The
town
of
Wewoka
was
the
homestead
for
the
Black
Seminole
Native
Americans
.

In
0000
,
Gopher
John
and
Wildcat
led
many
Seminole
into
Mexico
in
order
to
avoid
the
attempts
of
slavers
to
raid
families
and
capture
people
of
African
descent
.

The
Mexican
government
offered
Wildcat
and
his
band
land
in
Mexico
if
they
could
rid
the
land
of
renegades
who
were
terrorizing
Mexican
citizens
.

This
took
a
year
for
them
to
complete
the
migration
.

Wildcat
was
the
next
hereditary
chief
of
the
Seminole
nation
but
the
government
appointed
its
first
chief
John
Jumper
instead
.

Some
descendants
remained
here
in
Wewoka
and
some
came
back
from
Mexico
after
Wildcat
's
death
there
.

Many
remained
and
fought
in
Mexico
and
Texas
until
0000
.

Gopher
John
was
known
in
Mexico
as
Juan
Cavallo
,
or
John
Horse
.

Wewoka
is
named
for
the
Seminole
word
which
means
"
barking
waters
,
"
referring
to
the
small
rapids
in
the
creek
that
runs
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
.

The
city
was
founded
when
Elijah
J.
Brown
,
an
employee
of
the
federal
government
,
led
the
Seminole
Nation
in
0000
from
LeRoy
,
Kansas
to
Indian
Territory
.

During
the
Civil
War
,
the
Seminole
Nation
sided
with
the
Confederacy
.

When
the
Confederacy
lost
,
the
US
government
required
the
Seminole
to
sign
a
new
treaty
.

It
required
them
to
emancipate
their
slaves
,
give
freedmen
who
wanted
to
stay
in
the
territory
full
rights
as
citizens
,
including
voting
in
the
tribe
.

After
the
Civil
War
,
the
Seminole
Nation
made
Wewoka
their
capital
city
.

Along
with
the
Seminole
,
freedmen
also
settled
in
Wewoka
,
making
it
diverse
.

Elijah
Brown
was
the
only
legal
white
settler
in
the
county
until
the
Oklahoma
Land
Run
of
0000
.

In
0000
Wewoka
became
part
of
the
state
of
Oklahoma
,
which
was
admitted
to
the
union
.

In
0000
it
was
designated
as
the
county
seat
of
Seminole
County
after
winning
against
the
city
of
Seminole
.

The
city
developed
around
the
house
that
A.J.
Brown
and
his
wife
Mannie
Lou
built
at
00th
Avenue
and
Muskogee
.

Brown
and
his
brother
John
Brown
owned
and
operated
the
Wewoka
Trading
post
in
the
settlement
.

They
were
prominent
Seminole
of
Creek
and
Scottish
ancestry
.

Descendants
included
two
prominent
Seminole
chiefs
,
Lucy
Brown
McKellop
and
her
husband
John
F.
McKellop
.

The
house
still
stands
,
the
last
remaining
structure
of
the
Nineteenth
Seminole
Republic
.

It
straddles
the
border
between
the
Seminole
and
Creek
nations
and
is
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

In
March
0000
,
oil
was
discovered
a
mile
and
a
half
southeast
of
Wewoka
.

R.H.
Smith
drilled
the
first
commercial
well
in
0000
on
St.
Patrick
's
Day
.

Great
wealth
was
realized
by
many
Seminole
in
0000
with
the
exploration
of
the
Magnolia
Petroleum
Company
.

In
the
0000s
and
00
's
the
great
Seminole
Oil
Fields
were
the
largest
suppliers
of
oil
anywhere
in
the
world
.

In
0000
the
population
of
Wewoka
was
0,000
.

By
0000
the
population
increased
to
over
00,000
,
as
adventurers
and
workers
came
,
to
make
their
fortunes
.

It
rapidly
had
become
the
third-largest
city
in
Oklahoma
.

From
0000
to
the
present
,
the
oil
companies
took
out
as
much
as
they
could
get
.

As
the
oil
decreased
,
jobs
and
people
left
the
city
.

By
0000
the
population
of
Wewoka
was
0,000
and
in
0000
it
was
0,000
.

The
population
continued
a
steady
decline
,
but
the
city
has
continued
as
the
commercial
center
of
the
region
.

The
0000s
and
0000s
were
difficult
for
the
city
.

Many
businesses
left
town
and
poverty
greatly
increased
.

The
city
leaders
tried
to
protect
themselves
by
refusing
to
allow
competition
,
like
Wal-Mart
,
to
enter
the
city
.

Holdenville
and
Seminole
do
have
Wal-Mart
stores
.

Seminole
's
Wal-Mart
has
the
super-center
configuration
offering
groceries
as
well
as
dry
goods
.

The
crime
rate
in
Wewoka
during
the
0000s
increased
;
the
radio
commentator
Paul
Harvey
called
Wewoka
"
Little
Chicago
,
"
because
it
had
a
higher
crime
rate
per
capita
than
the
city
of
Chicago
.

The
violence
in
the
city
caused
many
people
to
avoid
coming
to
Wewoka
and
gave
the
city
a
reputation
that
continues
to
linger
.

By
the
mid
0000s
,
new
leadership
began
to
turn
commerce
around
in
the
city
.

The
police
force
was
increased
and
began
to
get
the
crime
rate
under
control
.

The
crime
rate
by
0000
was
below
average
for
the
state
of
Oklahoma
.

The
historic
downtown
received
a
face
lift
of
new
sidewalks
,
streets
,
lights
and
flowers
.

to
work
to
attract
businesses
and
maintain
population
.

The
current
population
of
Wewoka
is
just
over
0,000
.

The
projections
show
that
the
city
will
continue
to
decrease
in
the
coming
years
.

Barbecue
hub
Wewoka
's
reputation
for
barbecue
from
the
0000s
through
late
0000s
was
unmatched
.

Government
began
moving
the
Western
Cherokees
from

parts
of
Arkansas
Territory
into
this
area
,
then
called
Nicksville
.

Non-Indian
settlers
were
ordered
to
vacate
,
and
the
Arkansas
Territorial
Legislature
ended
its
claim
to
the
land
.

Dwight
Mission
took
over
Nicksville
.

The
area
became
part
of

Territory
.

A

in

settlers
in

moved
closer
to
the
railroad
and
a
marble
quarry
,

outcrops
.

quarrying
began
there
in

Comanche
is
a
city
in
Stephens
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Comanche
is
a
small
city
in
southwest
Oklahoma
set
in
rolling
prairie
land
interspersed
with
oil
fields
,
ranches
,
farms
,
pecan
orchards
,
and
timbered
areas
.

Comanche
is
located
in
what
was
once
the
famous
Louisiana
Purchase
,
a
part
of
which
was
later
in
0000
designated
Indian
Territory
,
and
set
aside
for
the
Five
Civilized
Tribes
.

Comanche
then
became
part
of
the
Chickasaw
Nation
and
was
identified
as
Comanche
,
Indian
Territory
until
statehood
in
0000
.

The
city
has
had
a
series
of
names
.

The
first
settlers
lived
north
of
the
present
site
and
called
the
settlement
Tucker
.

With
the
coming
of
the
Rock
Island
Railroad
in
0000
,
Indian
landowner
Johnny
D.
Wilson
gave
the
city
its
present
site
on
the
railroad
,
and
the
Tucker
post
office
was
moved
here
in
0000
.

Many
had
wanted
to
call
it
Wilson
Town
,
and
some
called
it
Border
Queen
because
of
the
annual
large
celebrations
,
carnivals
,
bands
,
and
Indian
activities
.

Mr.
Wilson
,
however
,
insisted
it
be
named
Comanche
because
of
the
Comanche
Indians
who
roamed
here
.

So
,
Comanche
was
incorporated
November
00
,
0000
and
began
its
progress
.

After
the
Civil
War
,
large
herds
of
cattle
moved
up
the
Chisholm
Trail
located
about
two
miles
(
0
km
)
east
of
present
day
Comanche
.

The
cattle
were
driven
from
Texas
,
through
Indian
Territory
to
Kansas
for
shipment
east
.

Parts
of
this
historic
trail
can
still
be
clearly
seen
today
.

Comanche
has
a
colorful
history
that
is
still
reflected
in
its
lifestyle
and
activities
.

A
western
flavor
is
felt
here
,
and
Comanche
is
often
called
the
"
Rodeo
Capital
of
the
World
"
.

Certainly
,
many
World
Champion
Rodeo
performers
call
Comanche
home
.

Race
horse
,
Quarter
Horse
owners
,
and
farmers
add
their
influence
as
do
oil
companies
and
oil
field
workers
.

Authentic
Indian
customs
and
tribal
observations
are
still
practiced
.

Artists
,
educators
,
and
others
add
still
more
variety
and
culture
.

Truly
,
it
can
be
said
that
Comanche
's
greatest
asset
is
its
diversity
of
talent
and
people
.

Judaism

as
being

an
adherence
to
the
laws
of

Founded

opened
for
settlers
in
0000
,
the
area
now
known
as
the
Oklahoma
Panhandle
was
sparsely
settled
ranchland
.

After
the
opening
some
of
the
land
was
filed
on
near
the
ranch
headquarters
,
mostly
by
the
cowboys
,
and
sold
to
the
ranch
as
soon
as
proved
up
.

Expansion
of
the
Rock
Island
Railroad
tracks
from
Liberal
,
Kansas
to
Santa
Rosa

Mexico
spurred
the
settlement
's
formation
.

0000
,
but
the

,
0000
,
as
there
was
another
Loretta
,
Oklahoma
.

Very
few
claims
were
filed
on

was
assured
.

town
grew
quickly
to
a
population
near
0,000
,
serving
as
the
closest
railroad
town
to
the
people
who
lived
as
far
north
and
west
as
present
Boise
City
,
and
south
into
the
Texas
Panhandle
to
the
present
town
of
Gruver
.

The
land
was
quickly
homesteaded
and
proved
to
be
a
rich
agricultural
area
.

History
Opening
the
Big
Pasture
The
Big
Pasture
,
approximately
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
Red
River
and
presently
located
in
parts
of
Comanche
,
Cotton
,
and
Tillman
counties
,
was
the
last
settled
territory
in
Oklahoma
.

Native
control
of
the
land
traces
to
the
Quapaw
,
who
ceded
it
to
the
United
States
in
0000
.

The
Choctaw
and
Chickasaw
accepted
the
area
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
but
lost
it
as
a
result
of
the
Reconstruction
Treaty
of
0000
.

By
the
terms
of
the
Medicine
Lodge
Treaty
of
0000
a
reservation
that
included
the
Big
Pasture
was
set-aside
for
the
Kiowa
,
Comanche
,
and
Apache
.

The
land
became
part
of
Oklahoma
Territory
in
December
0000
.

Opening
bids
to
quarter-sections
of
the
Big
Pasture
to
prospective
homesteader
began
on
December
0
and
ended
on
December
00
,
0000
.

There
were
over
000,000
bids
for
the
available
0,000
quarter-sections
.

Bids
varied
from
$
0,000.00
to
$
0,000.00
.

Prior
to
the
opening
of
the
area
,
the
United
States
platted
five
official
townships
:
Randlett
,
Ahpeatone
,
Isadore
,
Quanah
and
Eschiti
.

The
only
town
remaining
today
is
Randlett
.

Eschiti
was
the
official
town
nearest
the
present
site
of
Grandfield
.

The
Founding
Problems
began
when
the
Wichita
Falls
and
Northwestern
Railroad
missed
Eschiti
by
two
miles
and
Kell
City
(
named
for
the
railroad
promoter
Frank
Kell
of
Wichita
Falls
)
sprang
up
along
the
railroad
's
route
.

By
0000
,
Eschiti
had
an
official
United
States
Post
Office
and
Kell
City
had
the
railroad
.

Citizens
from
both
towns
were
in
heated
competition
for
new
settlers
and
businesses
moving
to
the
area
.

To
try
to
settle
the
differences
,
Reverend
Andrew
J.
Tant
,
a
Baptist
Minister
and
homesteader
,
went
into
partnership
with
Frank
Kell
and
offered
free
lots
to
businesses
if
they
would
relocate
to
the
Tant
farm
,
which
would
eventually
become
Grandfield
.

Since
the
Tant
farm
was
only
about
a
mile
from
Kell
City
,
people
willingly
moved
.

Free
lots
were
also
promised
to
all
churches
and
schools
.

Observers
at
that
time
wrote
they
could
look
through
their
windows
and
see
lines
of
houses
being
moved
.

According
to
Mrs.
Lawrence
Hooks
,
an
early
settler
,
she
once
cooked
breakfast
in
Eschiti
and
dinner
in
Grandfield
,
without
leaving
her
house
.

A
committee
appealed
to
the
United
States
Post
Office
to
establish
a
post
office
.

Assistant
Postmaster
General
Charles
P.
Grandfield
was
helpful
in
granting
the
request
.

Consequently
,
the
town
was
named
in
his
honor
.

On
January
00
,
0000
,
Grandfield
citizens
voted
,
almost
unanimously
,
for
incorporation
,
and
the
post
office
opened
January
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
the
population
stood
at
000
.

The
town
's
founders
and
early
residents
came
from
a
variety
of
locations
,
backgrounds
,
cultures
and
religions
;
the
States
of
Kentucky
,
Tennessee
,
Kansas
,
Missouri
,
Arkansas
and
Texas
were
well
represented
,
and
a
substantial
number
of
newly
arrived
European
immigrants
also
made
their
homes
in
Grandfield
.

The
Oil
Boom
There
were
two
oil
fields
discovered
in
the
Grandfield
area
:
the
Northwest
Oil
Field
;
and
the
Red
River
Oil
Field
.

The
influence
of
the
oil
industry
on
Grandfield
can
not
be
overstated
.

The
closing
of
the
Bell
Oil
and
Refinery
Company
refinery
in
the
0000s
arguably
started
the
population
decline
.

Sports
Grandfield
High
School
won
the
Oklahoma
High
School
Football
Class
C
Championship
in
0000
and
0000
.

Switching
from
00-man
to
0-man
football
,
they
captured
two
Class
C
state
football
championships
in
0000
and
0000
.

They
also
won
the
Girls
Basketball
Championship
in
0000
.

E.
Glenn
,
created
the
first
oil
gusher
in
what
would
soon
be
known
as
the
"
Glenn
Pool
"
.

The
discovery
set
off
a
boom
of
growth
for
the
area
,
bringing
in
hordes
of
people
:
lease
buyers
,
producers
,
millionaires
,
laborers
,
tool
suppliers
,
drunks
,
swindlers
,
and
newspeople
.

Daily
production
soon
exceeded
.

The
nearby
city
of
Tulsa
benefited
greatly
from
the
production
,
and
Glenpool
calls
itself
the
town
that
made
Tulsa
famous
.

By
0000
,
a
settlement
of
Glenn
,
consisting
of
twelve
families
had
grown
up
nearby
.

In
that
year
,
the
Midland
Valley
Railroad
extended
a
track
from
Jenks
.

By
0000
,
nearly
0,000
people
had
moved
to
the
area
.

However
,
only
about
five
hundred
people
actually
lived
in
the
town
in
0000
.

Lots
were
platted
and
a
post
office
opened
on
January
00
,
0000
.

The
new
community
was
renamed
Glenpool
.

Population
grew
to
000
in
0000
,
but
declined
thereafter
to
000
in
0000
.

A
post-WWII
building
boom
then
pushed
the
population
upward
to
000
in
0000
.

During
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
urban
sprawl
of
the
city
of
Tulsa
reached
Glenpool
,
and
the
town
became
a
bedroom
suburb
.

It
has
being
growing
since
.

By
0000
the
population
had
risen
to
000
,
then
to
0,000
in

family-friendly
event
with

&
crafts
,
a

Jenks
is
a
city
in
Tulsa
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
,
and
a
suburb
of
Tulsa
,
in
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state
.

It
is
situated
between
the
Arkansas
River
and
U.S.
Route
00
.

Jenks
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
cities
in
Oklahoma
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
population
was
0,000
,
but
by
0000
,
the
population
was
00,000
.

History
Jenks
began
in
0000
as
a
community
site
established
by
the
Midland
Valley
Railroad
between
Tulsa
and
Muskogee
,
alongside
the
Arkansas
River
.

Though
the
river
could
only
be
utilized
by
shallow
draft
steamboat
s
while
the
water
level
was
up
,
these
two
transportation
routes
proved
vital
to
Jenks
'
early
development
.

Jenks
was
named
after
William
Henry
Jenks
the
owner
and
director
of
the
Midland
Valley
Railroad
.

According
to
a
0000
article
in
the
Tulsa
Tribune
,
an
agent
for
the
townsite
company
was
told
by
the
railroad
home
office
to
name
a
town
for
the
director
.

The
town
was
officially
platted
on
July
00
,
0000
.

Also
in
0000
,
a
major
petroleum
discovery
was
made
,
further
bolstering
the
economy
of
the
area
.

The
"
Glenn
Pool
"
oil
well
and
subsequent
oil
claims
brought
many
business
people
to
the
general
area
.

In
0000
,
many
oil
depot
s
(
also
known
as
"
tank
farms
"
)
were
constructed
in
Jenks
.

By
the
time
of
statehood
,
Jenks
had
000
inhabitants
.

As
oil
production
waned
,
tank
farms
were
dismantled
,
and
agriculture
became
once
again
a
major
contributor
to
the
Jenks
economy
.

The
economy
of
the
area
was
further
improved
in
the
0000s
when
many
Bulgarian
families
immigrated
to
the
area
to
farm
.

These
immigrants
established
many
vegetable
farms
.

From
0000
through
the
0000s
,
Jenks
experienced
many
floods
from
the
overflow
of
the
Arkansas
River
and
Polecat
Creek
.

In
the
0000s
and
0000s
floods
were
very
severe
.

During
one
flood
in
the
late
0000s
the
water
was
so
deep
that
it
completely
covered
every
building
but
the
roof
of
the
three
story
high
school
.

Everyone
was
evacuated
except
two
men
and
one
woman
.

They
had
one
shotgun
,
one
small
boat
,
food
and
a
tent
on
top
of
the
school
.

They
guarded
the
remains
of
Jenks
for
several
weeks
until
the
water
receded
.

In
0000
,
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
built
a
levee
around
Jenks
,
and
the
community
subsequently
grew
as
a
result
of
the
increased
safety
and
security
.

Jenks
has
served
as
a
river
crossing
point
via
several
bridges
over
the
past
century
.

In
0000
,
a
single-lane
bridge
was
built
and
strengthened
the
economic
success
of
the
area
.

0000
saw
the
construction
of
a
replacement
two-lane
bridge
which
still
stands
today
and
now
serves
as
a
pedestrian
crossing
between
the
Riverwalk
and
the
South
Tulsa
River
Parks
.

The
original
0000
bridge
was
destroyed
and
all
that
is
left
are
a
few
columns
and
pieces
of
metal
that
are
seen
when
the
river
is
not
filled
with
rain
or
water
is
not
being
released
from
the
dam
.

A
four-lane
bridge
was
built
in
0000
.

The
current
High
School
building
was
built
in
0000-00
and
has
had
0
major
additions
.

The
United
States
Census
of
0000
placed
the
population
of
the
City
at
0000
and
there
were
approximately
0000
student
in
public
school
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
Tulsa
water
system
was
expanded
into
Jenks
.

That
decade
also
saw
the
construction
of
a
nearby
Public
Service
of
Oklahoma
gas-fired
electric
power
plant
.

These
developments
improved
the
infrastructure
of
the
area
and
helped
the
economy
.

In
the
0000s
,
Kimberly-Clark
built
a
manufacturing
facility
that
provides
many
jobs
for
the
area
to
this
day
.

community
at
the
intersection
of
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
(
MKT
)
Railway
and
the
Kansas
and
Arkansas
Valley
Railway
(
a
branch
of
the
Missouri
Pacific
Railway
)
,
when
William
McAnally
,
a
foreman
for
the
MKT
built
a
small
hotel
at
this
isolated
location
in
June
0000
.

By
the
next
summer
others
had
built
two
more
hotels
and
two
general
stores
.

The
town
was
named
for
railroad
dispatcher
Henry
"
Big
Foot
"
Wagoner
,
who
had
reported
the
need
for
a
railroad
switch
nearby
to
accommodate
the
shipment
of
logs
and
hay
.

The
switch
had
been
previously
named
"
Wagoner
's
Switch
.
"

The
switch
soon
relocated
to
the
town
and
caused
the
development
of
a
major
cattle
shipping
business
.

By
0000
,
the
community
had
000
names
in
a
local
census
.

A
local
newspaper
began
promoting
the
town
in
0000
,
encouraging
more
people
to
move
to
there
.

By
0000
,
there
were
approximately
0,000
residents
.

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
the
community
formed
a
commission
that
circulated
a
petition
requesting
incorporation
under
the
statutes
of
Arkansas
.

Incorporation
was
granted
by
the
U.
S.
District
Court
on
January
0
,
0000
,
making
Wagoner
the
first
city
incorporated
in
Indian
Territory
.

A
privately
funded
courthouse
was
built
in
0000
,
which
housed
a
newly-created
U.
S.
Western
District
Court
.

The
Dawes
Commission
turned
Indian
Territory
land
from
tribal
to
individual
ownership
by
members
of
each
tribe
.

The
individuals
were
allowed
to
sell
their
land
to
non-Indians
,
causing
a
real
estate
boom
in
farmland
around
the
area
.

By
statehood
,
the
city
had
0,000
residents
and
was
named
as
the
county
seat
of
Wagoner
County
.

The
boom
continued
through
0000
,
when
the
population
reached
0,000
.

The
MKT
had
located
a
division
headquarters
in
the
city
,
which
then
had
three
railroad
trunk
lines
and
twenty
passenger
trains
a
day
.

Industries
included
three
grain
elevators
,
a
cotton
gin
,
cotton
oil
mill
,
iron
foundry
,
hardwood
company
,
cement
plant
,
and
roller
mill
.

However
,
the
boom
ended
in
0000
,
when
the
MKT
moved
its
division
headquarters
to
Muskogee
.

The
oil
boom
farther
west
and
later
,
the
Great
Depression
,
caused
a
further
decline
in
the
city
's
economy
and
population
.

World
War
II
started
a
revival
of
Wagoner
's
fortunes
.

The
city
lay
between
two
war-related
Federal
Government
projects
:
Camp
Gruber
to
the
south
and
the
Oklahoma
Ordnance
Works
to
the
north
.

After
the
war
,
several
small
manufacturing
industries
took
root
.

Completion
of
the
nearby
Fort
Gibson
Lake
in
0000
stimulated
the
economy
and
turned
Wagoner
into
a
sports
and
retirement
center
.

The
McLellan-Kerr
navigational
channel
made
the
agricultural
area
accessible
by
barges
,
stimulating
farm-related
businesses
.

Highway
improvements
made
Wagoner
a
bedroom
community
for
Tulsa
and
Muskogee
.

History
The
Atchison
,
Topeka
&
Santa
Fe
Railway
built
a
station
at
this
site
in
0000
,
which
it
named
Copan
,
after
the
city
of
Copán
,
Honduras
.

However
,
when
a
post
office
was
established
here
in
0000
,
it
was
designated
as
Lawton
.

The
settlement
was
renamed
Weldon
in
0000
,
but
reverted
to
Copan
in
0000
.

It
was
incorporated
under
that
name
in
Indian
Territory
in
0000
.

The
Copan
school
district
was
founded
in
0000
,
as
well
.

By
0000
,
the
town
had
000
residents
.

The
blossoming
oil
industry
in
Washington
County
spurred
the
growth
of
Copan
.

The
Prairie
Oil
and
Gas
Company
built
Oklahoma
's
first
trunk
pipeline
,
which
ran
from
Bartlesville
,
Oklahoma
to
Humboldt
,
Kansas
in
0000
.

It
also
included
an
oil
storage
terminal
near
Copan
,
with
000
tanks
,
designed
to
hold
00,000
barrels
of
crude
oil
.

The
Copan
oil
field
was
discovered
in
0000
,
and
had
nearly
0,000
producing
wells
by
0000
.

The
town
managed
to
survive
and
recover
from
major
fires
in
0000
,
0000
and
0000
.

It
enjoyed
a
spurt
of
growth
after
the
creation
of
nearby
Lake
Hulah
in
0000
,
and
Lake
Copan
in
0000
.

Population
reached
a
high
of
000
in
0000
,
largely
because
the
lakes
increased
tourism
.

The
town
economy
is
now
largely
based
on
travel
and
recreation
.

,

)
was
the
president
of
Yale
University
and
later
the
seventh
Commissioner
of
Major
League
Baseball
.

Giamatti
negotiated
the
agreement
that
terminated
the
Pete
Rose
betting
scandal
by
permitting
Rose
to
voluntarily
withdraw
from
the
sport
,
avoiding
further
punishment
.

Personal
life
Giamatti
was
born
in
Boston
and
grew
up
in
South
Hadley
,
Massachusetts
,
the
son
of
Mary
Claybaugh
Walton
(
Smith
College
'
00
)
and
Valentine
John
Giamatti
.

His
father
was
professor
and
chairman
of
the
Department
of
Italian
Language
and
Literature
at
Mount
Holyoke
College
.

Giamatti
's
paternal
grandparents
were
Italian
immigrants
Angelo
Giammattei
(
)
and
Maria
Lavorgna
(
)
:
his
grandfather
Angelo
emigrated
to
the
United
States
from
Telese
,
near
Naples
,
Italy
,
around
0000
.

Giamatti
's
maternal
grandparents
,
from
Wakefield
,
Massachusetts
,
were
Helen
Buffum
(
Davidson
)
and
Bartlett
Walton
,
who
graduated
from
Phillips
Academy
Andover
and
Harvard
College
.

Giamatti
attended
South
Hadley
High
School
,
spent
his
junior
year
at
the
Overseas
School
of
Rome
,
and
graduated
from
Phillips
Academy
in
0000
.

At
Yale
University
,
he
was
a
member
of
Delta
Kappa
Epsilon
(
Phi
chapter
)
and
as
a
junior
in
0000
was
tapped
by
Scroll
and
Key
,
a
senior
secret
society
.

He
graduated
magna
cum
laude
in
0000
.

That
same
year
,
he
married
Toni
Marilyn
Smith
,
who
taught
English
for
more
than
00
years
at
the
Hopkins
School
in
New
Haven
,
Connecticut
,
until
her
death
in
0000
.

Together
the
couple
had
three
children
:
Hollywood
actors
Paul
and
Marcus
and
jewelry
designer
Elena
.

In
the
film
Sideways
,
a
photograph
of
the
character
Miles
Raymond
(
portrayed
by
Giamatti
's
son
Paul
)
with
his
late
father
is
really
a
picture
of
Paul
and
Bart
Giamatti
.

Giamatti
's
friend
and
successor
as
baseball
commissioner
,
Fay
Vincent
,
wrote
in
The
Last
Commissioner
that
Giamatti
's
official
religious
view
was
agnosticism
.

Yale
Giamatti
stayed
in
New
Haven
to
receive
his
doctorate
in
0000
,
when
he
also
published
a
volume
of
essays
by
Thomas
Bergin
he
had
coedited
with
a
philosophy
graduate
student
,
T.
K.
Seung
.

He
became
a
professor
of
comparative
literature
at
Yale
University
,
an
author
,
and
master
of
Ezra
Stiles
College
at
Yale
,
a
post
to
which
he
was
appointed
by
his
predecessor
as
Yale
president
,
Kingman
Brewster
,
Jr.
.

Giamatti
taught
briefly
at
Princeton
but
spent
most
of
his
academic
life
at
Yale
.

Giamatti
's
scholarly
work
focused
on
English
Renaissance
literature
,
particularly
Edmund
Spenser
,
and
relationships
between
English
and
Italian
Renaissance
poets
.

His
writings
on
the
pastoral
influence
in
literature
and
the
effect
of
Ludovico
Ariosto
on
English
literature
remain
influential
.

As
a
teacher
of
undergraduates
,
he
was
well
known
,
and
rejected
the
conventional
wisdom
that
the
Renaissance
represented
an
abrupt
cultural
change
,
stressing
the
continuities
between
the
Middle
Ages
and
the
Renaissance
.

He
sometimes
referred
to
the
Protestant
Reformation
as
the
"
Protestant
Deformation
.
"

When
Giamatti
's
tenure
as
Stiles
master
ended
in
0000
,
he
was
so
popular
that
his
students
wanted
to
honor
him
with
a
present
.

Giamatti
told
them
he
wanted
a
joke
gift
and
they
got
him
a
moosehead
(
from
a
yard
sale
)
,
which
was
ceremoniously
hung
in
the
dining
hall
.

Giamatti
served
as
president
of
Yale
University
from
0000
to
0000
.

He
was
the
youngest
president
of
the
university
in
its
history
and
presided
over
the
university
during
a
bitter
strike
by
its
clerical
and
technical
workers
in
0000-00
.

As
university
president
,
he
refused
student
,
faculty
,
and
community
demands
to
divest
from
apartheid
South
Africa
.

He
also
served
on
the
board
of
trustees
of
Mount
Holyoke
College
for
many
years
,
participating
fully
despite
his
Yale
and
baseball
commitments
.

Giamatti
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
American
Academy
of
Arts
and
Sciences
in
0000
.

Baseball
Giamatti
had
a
lifelong
interest
in
baseball
(
he
was
a
die-hard
Boston
Red
Sox
fan
)
.

In
0000
,
when
he
was
first
rumored
to
be
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
of
Yale
,
he
had
deflected
questions
by
observing
that
"
The
only
thing
I
ever
wanted
to
be
president
of
was
the
American
League
.
"

0
He
became
president
of
the
National
League
in
,
and
later
commissioner
of
baseball
in
.

During
his
stint
as
National
League
president
,
Giamatti
placed
an
emphasis
on
the
need
to
improve
the
environment
for
the
fan
in
the
ballparks
.

He
also
decided
to
make
umpires
strictly
enforce
the
balk
rule
and
supported
"
social
justice
"
as
the
only
remedy
for
the
lack
of
presence
of
minority
managers
,
coaches
,
or
executives
at
any
level
in
Major
League
Baseball
.

While
still
serving
as
National
League
president
,
Giamatti
suspended
Pete
Rose
for
00
games
after
Rose
shoved
umpire
Dave
Pallone
on
April
00
,
0000
.

Later
that
year
,
Giamatti
also
suspended
Los
Angeles
Dodgers
pitcher
Jay
Howell
,
who
was
caught
using
pine
tar
during
the
National
League
Championship
Series
.

Giamatti
,
whose
tough
dealing
with
Yale
's
union
favorably
impressed
Major
League
Baseball
owners
,
was
unanimously
elected
to
succeed
Peter
Ueberroth
as
commissioner
on
September
0
,
.

Determined
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
game
,
on
August
00
,
,
Giamatti
prevailed
upon
Pete
Rose
to
agree
voluntarily
to
remain
permanently
ineligible
to
play
baseball
.

Death
While
at
his
vacation
home
on
Martha
's
Vineyard
,
Giamatti
,
a
heavy
smoker
for
many
years
,
died
suddenly
of
a
massive
heart
attack
at
the
age
of
00
,
just
eight
days
after
banishing
Pete
Rose
and
000
days
into
his
tenure
as
commissioner
.

He
became
the
second
baseball
commissioner
to
die
in
office
,
the
first
being
Kenesaw
Mountain
Landis
.

Baseball
's
owners
soon
selected
Fay
Vincent
,
Giamatti
's
close
friend
and
baseball
's
first-ever
deputy
commissioner
,
as
the
new
commissioner
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
before
Game
0
at
the
World
Series
,
Giamatti
—
to
whom
this
World
Series
was
dedicated
—
was
memorialized
with
a
moment
of
silence
.

Son
Marcus
Giamatti
threw
out
the
first
pitch
before
the
game
.

Also
before
Game
One
,
the
Yale
Whiffenpoofs
sang
the
national
anthem
,
a
blend
of
The
Star-Spangled
Banner
with
America
the
Beautiful
that
has
been
since
repeated
by
other
a
cappella
groups
.

Prior
to
the
first
game
of
the
0000
Major
League
Baseball
season
,
played
at
Fenway
Park
,
Toni
Giamatti
threw
out
the
ceremonial
first
pitch
.

She
would
perform
the
honors
again
prior
to
Game
0
of
the
0000
World
Series
.

The

May
,
0000
and
received
only
one
exit

,
the

a
decline
due

repair
shop
on

.

However
,
the
most
commonly
believed
story
is
that
the
town
received
its
name
because
its
first
post
office
was
in
a
corn
field
.

The
town
was
originally
settled
by
German
and
Russian
Mennonites
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
around
the
time
of
the
Cheyenne-Arapaho
Land
Run
,
a
Mennonite
Brethren
missionary
stationed
nearby
invited
fellow
Mennonites
from
Kansas
to
homestead
in
the
area
.

They
brought
along
"
Turkey
Red
"
wheat
,
which
grew
well
in
the
western
Oklahoma
soil
.

On
its
one-hundredth
birthday
the
town
received
a
historical
marker
celebrating
this
accomplishment
.

World
War
I
brought
harassment
by
vigilantes
and
the
county
Council
of
Defense
on
many
of
the
Germans
and
Mennonites
that
lived
in
and
around
Corn
.

Not
only
did
the
town
change
its
name
during
this
time
,
but
a
German
newspaper
ceased
operation
.

The
town
is
also
known
for
being
the
second
tornado
filmed
in
history
(
and
the
first
in
the
United
States
)
,
on
June
0
,
0000
.

The
first
known
tornado
captured
on
film
was
a
waterspout
in
Cuba
in
0000
.

On
April
00
,
0000
the
public
school
in
Corn
,
Washita
Heights
,
closed
due
to
lack
of
students
in
the
district
and
lack
of
funding
from
the
state
.

The
nearby
town
of
Cordell
took
over
the
district
.

The
private
school
,
Corn
Bible
,
still
remains
open
.

Corn
was
home
to
the
grandmother
of

Foss
is
a
town
in
Washita
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
town
population
was
000
.

History
The
history
of
Foss
began
when
settlers
from
the
area
of
the
Wilson
post
office
moved
four
miles
north
to
the
valley
of
Turkey
Creek
in
the
late
0000s
.

They
initially
wanted
their
new
post
office
to
be
called
Graham
,
but
since
that
name
was
already
taken
it
was
named
Maharg
.

A
flash
flood
on
May
0
,
0000
wiped
out
the
town
on
Turkey
Creek
,
destroying
businesses
and
drowning
several
people
.

The
town
rebuilt
on
higher
ground
and
was
named
Foss
.

The
post
office
began
operation
on
September
00
,
0000
.

The
town
expanded
rapidly
.

By
0000
the
town
had
a
population
between
000
and
0000
residents
.

It
boasted
two
bank
s
,
three
cotton
gin
s
,
and
by
0000
had
an
electric
plant
,
two
hotel
s
and
an
opera
house
.

The
population
stabilized
near
000
.

In
the
0000s
the
town
began
to
have
problems
and
the
nearby
cities
of
Clinton
and
Elk
City
absorbed
more
and
more
trade
.

During
the
Great
Depression
more
people
moved
away
.

During
World
War
II
,
the
town
boasted
a
population
of
over
000
residents
,
relying
primarily
on
Route
00
travellers
(
which
passed
half
a
mile
south
of
the
city
)
and
a
U.S.
naval
base
south
of
the
town
that
operated
during
wartime
.

A
gas
station
and
a
café
also
operated
in
the
town
around
that
time
.

Though
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
there
was
an
economic
revival
due
to
the
nearby
Air
Force
installation
at
Burns
Flat
.

When
the
base
closed
and
Interstate
00
bypassed
Foss
the
town
declined
further
.

The
last
bank
left
in
September
0000
.

Foss
had
two
newspaper

,
the
Foss

New
Cordell
is
a
city
in
Washita
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Cordell
was
previously
located
a
few
miles
from
the
current
spot
,
but
was
moved
around
0000
,
thus
the
name
New
Cordell
.

It
was
named
for
a
U.
S.
Postal
Service
employee
in
Washington
D.
C.
,
Wayne
W.
Cordell
.

The
town
is
now
commonly
called
Cordell
.

History
Cordell
began
when
H.
D.
Young
opened
a
general
store
about
0.0
miles
east
of
the
present
town
,
shortly
after
the
0000
Cheyenne
and
Arapaho
lands
were
opened
for
non-Indian
settlement
in
0000
.

A
post
office
named
Cordell
was
established
in
the
same
year
in
Young
's
store
.

In
0000
,
A.
J.
Cordell
and
J.
C.
Harrell
convinced
Young
to
move
his
store
to
the
present
site
,
where
water
was
more
plentiful
and
of
better
quality
than
in
Old
Cordell
.

The
new
location
became
known
as
New
Cordell
.

In
0000
,
Washita
County
residents
voted
to
move
the
county
seat
from
the
town
of
Cloud
Chief
to
New
Cordell
.

The
move
was
challenged
in
the
court
as
illegal
,
because
only
the
territorial
legislature
could
authorize
such
an
action
.

In
0000
,
the
Oklahoma
Territorial
Supreme
Court
ruled
that
the
county
seat
must
return
to
Cloud
Chief
.

A
Cordell
attorney
,
Sam
Massengale
,
traveled
to
Washington
,
where
he
lobbied
for
a
bill
to
make
Cordell
the
official
county
seat
.

The
bill
passed
the
U.
S.
Congress
in
0000
.

The
county
courthouse
was
destroyed
by
a
fire
in
0000
.

It
was
rebuilt
by
0000
by
the
same
architect
who
designed
the
Oklahoma
State
Capitol
.

Governor
George
Nigh
called
it
,
"
...
godfather
of
all
courthouses
in
the

History
Located
in
southwestern
Washita
County
,
Sentinel
lies
at
the
intersection
of
State
Highways
00
and
00
.

The
town
is
primarily
an
agriculture-based
community
.

The
0000
Cheyenne
and
Arapaho
Opening
brought
non-Indians
into
the
region
.

In
0000
R.
B.
Gore
,
a
pioneer
of
Old
Greer
County
,
established
a
small
general
merchandise
store
in
the
area
and
applied
for
a
post
office
.

On
March
0
,
0000
,
the
Post
Office
Department
approved
the
application
and
designated
the
locale
as
Sentinel
,
Oklahoma
Territory
.

The
name
originated
from
Cloud
Chief
's
Herald-Sentinel
newspaper
.

This
store
was
approximately
one
mile
east
of
the
present
town
.

In
0000
the
Kansas
City
,
Mexico
and
Orient
Railway
,
later
bought
by
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
,
and
Sante
Fe
Railway
,
began
purchasing
rights-of-way
and
designating
new
townsites
for
a
proposed
railroad
.

The
newly
formed
Orient
Townsite
Company
chose
the
site
of
present
Sentinel
and
received
a
donation
of
eighty
acres
from
L.
N.
Whitmer
.

They
named
the
new
town
Barton
and
filed
a
plat
on
September
00
,
0000
.

The
new
residents
asked
Gore
to
relocate
his
store
and
post
office
to
the
new
location
.

This
caused
confusion
,
as
the
town
and
post
office
had
different
names
.

In
0000
Will
Hornbeck
established
the
Sentinel
News-Boy
.

Determined
to
correct
the
name
problem
,
he
started
a
petition
to
incorporate
the
town
as
Sentinel
.

In
0000
the
voters
approved
this
measure
in
an
election
.

In
August
0000
the
town
officially
became
Sentinel
.

At
0000
statehood
it
had
000
residents
.

By
0000
the
Orient
had
built
their
tracks
through
the
village
.

In
0000
the

four
grocers

History
Prior
to
the
opening
of
the
Cherokee
Strip
in
0000
,
Capron
,
Oklahoma
was
first
known
as
"
Warren
"
,
a
small
cattle
station
on
the
main
line
of
the
Santa
Fe
railroad
.

It
consisted
of
a
store
,
and
an
old
railroad
car
left
by
the
Santa
Fe
.

Sometime
after
the
opening
of
the
strip
residents
wanted
to
come
up
with
a
new
name
for
the
growing
town
.

The
name
was
changed
to
"
Sterling
"
,
but
the
postal
service
and
Santa
Fe
would
not
accept
it
because
there
was
a
town
by
that
name
on
their
line
in
Kansas
.

The
names
of
"
Virgil
"
and
"
Kermit
"
were
proposed
,
but
Santa
Fe
would
not
accept
these
names
,
for
the
same
reason
.

Therefore
,
a
committee
consisting
of
Mr.
George
Espy
,
postmaster
,
Dr.
G.W.
Todd
,
and
Congressman
Dennis
Flynn
was
appointed
to
select
a
name
which
the
Santa
Fe
and
Postal
Service
would
accept
.

The
name
of
Captain
Allyn
K.
Capron
,
Jr.
was
proposed
.

Captain
Capron
was
a
member
of
Teddy
Roosevelt
's
Rough
Riders
,
and
had
been
killed
at
the
Battle
of
San
Juan
Hill
.

The
name
of
"
Capron
"
was
approved
by
a
petition
of
the
residents
.

The
Santa
Fe
and
U.
S.
Postal
service
accepted
the
name
and
so
it
stands
today
.

At
one
time
Capron
was
quite
a
thriving
community
.

It
had
two
banks
;
the
Bank
of
Capron
,
and
the
Capron
State
Bank
;
three
general
stores
;
two
drug
stores
;
a
hotel
;
depot
;
a
millinery
shop
;
theater
;
blacksmith
;
a
weekly
newspaper
,
The
Capron
Hustler
;
a
monthly
newspaper
,
The
Screech
Owl
;
two
barber
shops
;
hardware
store
;
lumber
yard
;
two
churches
,
Warburton
Memorial
Methodist
Church
,
and
First
Congregational
Church
;
the
Driftwood
Telephone
Company
and
Hampton
's
Foot
Powder
Factory
.

In
April
0000
a
tornado
struck
Capron
,
making
a
straight
line
down
the
main
business
street
.

Many
of
the
residents
of
town
did
not
even
know
the
tornado
has
struck
until
the
next
morning
when
they
went
downtown
to
open
their
stores
and
found
them
gone
.

Most
tornadoes
sound
like
trains
,
and
since
a
train
goes
through
Capron
about
every
00
minutes
no
one
noticed
!

Most
of
the
above
businesses
,
and
the
public
school
building
,
which
was
only
00
years
old
,
were
destroyed
.

The
majority
of
these
businesses
were
never
rebuilt
.

However
,
the
public
schools
were
rebuilt
.

Capron
was
always
concerned
with
having
a
good
school
system
.

In
0000
a
small
but
enterprising
group
of
Driftwood
Township
citizens
provided
for
the
establishment
of
the
first
Capron
Public
Schools
.

The
school
consisted
of
grades
0
–
0
and
consisted
of
a
two-room
frame
building
located
south
and
east
of
the
present
south
Coop
Grain
Elevator
.

This
building
proved
adequate
until
0000
when
a
new
two-story
brick
building
was
built
in
the
north
end
of
town
at
the
site
of
the
present
school
building
.

The
cost
of
the
0000
building
was
$
0,000.00
.

In
0000
residents
approved
the
building
of
a
new
one-story
building
with
a
large
gymnasium
and
auditorium
attached
.

The
old
two-story
building
was
torn
down
to
make
way
for
this
modern
facility
.

This
building
was
destroyed
in
the
0000
tornado
and
a
new
building
,
auditorium
and
gymnasium
were
built
in
0000
.

At
the
time
,
this
facility
was
considered
to
be
one
of
the
best
schools
in
northwest
Oklahoma
.

Additions
to
the
present
building
were
made
:
in
0000
,
vocational
agriculture
building
;
0000
,
additional
classrooms
and
music
room
;
and
0000
,
when
a
new
cafeteria
was
added
to
the
school
.

The
high
school
was
first
accredited
in
0000
.

In
0000
the
high
school
was
closed
due
to
falling
enrollment
.

There
were
no
families
in
the
school
district
on
public
assistance
in
0000
,
and
the
patrons
of
the
district
never
voted
down
a
tax
increase
for
their
school
;
they
wanted
the
very
best
for
their
children
.

The
Elementary
School
,
grades
K
–
0
were
closed
in
0000
by
a
vote
of
the
patrons
which
carried
by
only
one
vote
.

The
vote
was
contested
.

This
decision
was
taken
to
court
and
eventually
upheld
by
the
Oklahoma
Supreme
Court
.

Today
Capron
has
two
large
concrete
grain
elevator
s
,
a
rural
water
district
office
,
United
Methodist
Church
,
garage
,
filling
station
,
and
American
Legion
Post
.

The
Post
Office
closed
in
0000
after
000
years
of
service
to
the
citizens
of
the
area
.

It
is
hard
to
believe
that
any
of
this
once
thriving
little
center
of
trade
ever
existed
and
today
lives
only
in
the
memories
of
many
of
its
older
residents
.

Woodward
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Woodward
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

It
is
the
largest
city
in
a
nine-county
area
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
area
was
historically
occupied
by
the
Kiowa
,
Comanche
,
Cheyenne
and
Arapaho
tribes
.

European-American
settlers
established
the
town
in
0000
,
after
construction
of
the
railroad
to
that
point
for
shipping
cattle
to
markets
.

The
town
was
on
the
Great
Western
Cattle
Trail
.

In
the
00th
century
,
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
depots
in
the
Oklahoma
Territory
for
shipping
cattle
to
the
East
.

As
an
important
cattle
town
,
it
had
the
rough
frontier
bawdiness
of
the
time
.

The
United
States
opened
up
much
of
the
area
to
European-American
settlement
by
the
Land
Run
of
0000
and
migrants
rushed
into
the
area
.

Boiling
Springs
State
Park
has
been
established
east
of
the
city
.

(
This
park
contains
many
natural
artesian
springs
which
seem
to
boil
from
the
sand
.
)

After
statehood
,
in
0000
Woodward
was
established
as
a
court
town
for
the
US
District
Court
of
western
Oklahoma
.

Annual
federal
dockets
were
held
annually
in
November
through
0000
,
and
sporadically
by
need
after
that
.

History
For
thousands
of
years
,
succeeding
cultures
of
indigenous
peoples
inhabited
the
areas
along
the
North
Canadian
River
.

The
Plains
tribes
adopted
use
of
the
horse
from
the
Spanish
settlers
in
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
,
which
greatly
increased
their
range
of
nomadic
hunting
.

Before
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
historic
Plains
tribes
of
the
Kiowa
,
Comanche
,
Apache
,
Cheyenne
,
and
Arapaho
occupied
this
area
.

Boiling
Springs
,
near
present-day
Woodward
,
was
a
favorite
campsite
of
the
Plains
Indians
.

A
battle
between
the
Kiowa
and
Cheyenne
tribes
took
place
nearby
in
0000
.

The
Kiowa
and
Comanche
tribes
also
battled
the
United
States
Army
in
0000
in
this
area
,
when
the
US
redeployed
troops
after
the
Civil
War
against
Native
Americans
in
the
West
.

In
the
later
00th
century
,
a
wide
area
around
the
springs
became
the
site
of
numerous
battles
between
these
tribes
and
the
United
States
soldiers
and
settlers
trying
to
push
them
out
.

After
the
war
,
US
Army
made
various
expeditions
against
the
Plains
tribes
in
Woodward
County
.

These
were
led
by
the
lieutenant
colonels
Alfred
Sully
and
George
Armstrong
Custer
,
and
General
Philip
Sheridan
,
who
were
stationed
nearby
at
Fort
Supply
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
Comanche
considered
this
area
as
part
of
their
"
Comancheria
,
"
the
unofficial
name
of
their
territory
,
which
stretched
from
Kansas
to
Mexico
.

After
construction
of
the
railroad
to
the
area
,
in
0000
European-American
settlers
established
Woodward
at
the
junction
of
the
Fort
Reno
Military
Road
and
the
Southern
Kansas
Railway
(
a
subsidiary
of
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
and
Santa
Fe
Railroad
)
on
the
south
bank
of
the
North
Canadian
River
.

The
town
soon
became
an
important
shipping
point
,
both
for
provisioning
Fort
Supply
and
as
a
place
for
loading
cattle
grazed
in
the
Cherokee
Outlet
for
shipment
to
eastern
markets
.

In
the
late
00th
century
before
statehood
,
Woodward
was
one
of
the
most
important
depots
in
the
Oklahoma
Territory
for
shipping
cattle
to
the
East
and
Northern
tier
of
states
.

The
Great
Western
Cattle
Trail
crossed
where
Woodward
was
developed
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
more
than
00,000
migrants
settled
across
the
old
Cherokee
Outlet
of
northern
Oklahoma
in
the
greatest
land
run
in
American
history
.

They
founded
cities
that
day
from
Woodward
to
Enid
and
Ponca
City
.

In
the
summer
of
0000
,
carpenters
erected
the
first
government
building
at
the
railroad
depot
called
Woodward
.

By
that
time
,
Woodward
had
approximately
000
residents
.

Since
territorial
days
,
Woodward
has
served
as
the
county
seat
of
Woodward
County
.

Like
Dodge
City
,
Kansas
to
the
North
,
Woodward
boasted
a
cattle
town
array
of
saloons
,
gambling
halls
,
and
brothels
.

Woodward
's
Equity
,
Midway
,
Shamrock
,
and
Cabinet
saloons
,
and
the
Dew
Drop
Inn
,
were
widely
known
as
watering
holes
for
drovers
at
the
end
of
a
cattle
drive
.

The
latter
,
which
also
served
as
a
brothel
,
was
owned
and
managed
by
Dollie
Kezer
.

Before
coming
to
Woodward
,
she
had
worked
at
some
of
Denver
,
Colorado
's
most
famous
brothels
and
was
known
to
have
attended
lavish
parties
thrown
by
Horace
Tabor
.

In
0000
,
Temple
Lea
Houston
,
the
youngest
son
of
the
Texas
revolutionary
and
president
Samuel
Houston
,
moved
his
law
practice
and
family
to
Woodward
.

After
a
personal
disagreement
in
the
Cabinet
Saloon
with
the
brother
and
father
of
the
outlaw
Al
Jennings
,
Houston
shot
and
killed
the
brother
.

Houston
's
close
friend
Jack
E.
Love
joined
him
in
the
gun-fight
.

The
events
did
not
slow
their
careers
.

Houston
was
charged
and
tried
for
murder
in
Woodward
,
but
he
was
acquitted
on
grounds
of
self-defense
.

Love
was
later
elected
to
the
office
of
the
Oklahoma
Corporation
Commission
and
served
as
its
first
chairman
.

Houston
won
a
reputation
as
a
brilliant
trial
lawyer
known
for
his
courtroom
dramatics
.

He
delivered
his
"
Soiled
Dove
Plea
"
in
a
makeshift
courtroom
in
Woodward
's
opera
house
.

His
argument
on
behalf
of
a
prostitute
who
worked
at
the
Dew
Drop
Inn
became
famous
and
resulted
in
her
acquittal
by
the
jury
after
ten
minutes
'
consideration
.

On
September
0
,
0000
,
William
Jennings
Bryan
spoke
to
00,000
people
gathered
in
Woodward
,
urging
the
ratification
of
Oklahoma
's
proposed
state
constitution
and
the
election
of
a
Democratic
Party
ticket
.

Two
months
later
the
proclamation
admitting
Oklahoma
as
a
state
was
signed
by
Theodore
Roosevelt
with
the
quill
from
an
American
Golden
Eagle
captured
near
Woodward
.

By
a
0000
Act
of
Congress
,
Woodward
became
a
designated
court
town
for
the
United
States
District
Court
for
the
Western
District
of
Oklahoma
.

A
United

Post
Office
and
Courthouse
was
constructed
in

.

Federal
court

Halfway
is
a
small
town
in
Baker
County
,
Oregon
,
United
States
.

This
town
took
its
name
from
the
location
of
its
post
office
,
on
the
Alexander
Stalker
ranch
,
half
way
between
Pine
and
Cornucopia
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
town
made
history
in
December
0000
,
when
it
agreed
to
rename
(
proclaim
)
itself
as
Half.com
,
Oregon
(
albeit
temporarily
:
for
a
year
)
after
the
e-commerce
company
as
a
publicity
stunt
and
became
the
first
city
in
the
United
States
to
rename
itself
for
a
dot-com
company
.

The
proclamation
was
in
name
only
,
so
the
city
did
not
legally
change
its
name
.

History
The
area
was
originally
used
as
hunting
territory
by
the
Nez
Perce
,
Umatilla
and
Shoshone
tribes
.

It
was
explored
and
mapped
by
Benjamin
Bonneville
in
the
0000s
,
and
first
settled
by
Euro-Americans
in
the
0000s
.

The
smaller
national
forest
s
now
combined
into
the
local
Wallowa
–
Whitman
National
Forest
were
created
in
0000
.

While
a
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
the
town
was
plat
ted
in
another
location
in
0000
,
the
post
office
moved
there
in
0000
,
and
it
incorporated
in
0000
.

The
town
has
always
been
primarily
a
farming
and
ranching
community
.

There
was
a
small
gold
rush
to
nearby
Cornucopia
,
now
a
ghost
town
,
and
some
timber
industry
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Major
employer
the
Idaho
Power
Company
now
operates
three
hydroelectric
dam
s
on
the
Snake
River
.

Half.com
name
change
Halfway
earned
a
place
in
the
history
of
the
dot-com
era
in
December
0000
,
when
it
received
and
accepted
an
offer
to
rename
itself
as
Half.com
,
Oregon
after
the
e-commerce
start-up
for
one
year
in
exchange
for
$
000,000
,
00
computers
for
the
school
,
and
other
financial
subsidies
,
and
became
the
first
city
in
the
world
to
rename
itself
as
a
dot
com
.

Among
the
reasons
the
town
was
chosen
were
its
small
population
size
and
thus
its
likelihood
to
accept
such
an
offer
,
and
the
city
's
global
geographic
location
,
which
fit
perfectly
into
Half.com
's
marketing
scheme
.
"

They
're
within
four
miles
of
the
00th
parallel
which
makes
it
halfway
between
the
equator
and
the
North
Pole
"
,
which
added
to
its
cachet
.

The
name
proclamation
was
in
name
only
,
so
the
city
did
not
legally
change
its
name
.

The
city
created
and
posted
two
signs
at
its
borders
that
greeted
visitors
with
"
America
's
First
Dot-com
City
,
"
one
of
which
the
city
auctioned
off
in
September
0000
for
$
0000
.

The
winner
was
Half.com
's
founder
Josh
Kopelman
.

Since
the
company
Half.com
was
bought
by
eBay
in
February
0000
,
it
has
not
been
made
clear
whether
eBay
would
honor
the
numerous
financial
considerations
to
the
city
.

The
original
financial
conditions
that
led
to
the
city
accepting
Half.com
's
offer
returned
in
0000
,
when
the
company
owning
a
promissory
note
secured
by
its
fairgrounds
and
improvements
demanded
payment
of
over
$
000,000
.

Foreclosure
of
the
00-year-old
fairgrounds
would
endanger
the
future
of
the
yearly
Baker
County
Fair
and
the
annual
rodeo
.

Halfway
is
located
east
of
Baker

Huntington
is
a
city
in
Baker
County
,
on
the
eastern
border
of
Oregon
,
United
States
.

It
is
located
on
the
Snake
River
and
along
Interstate
00
and
U.S.
Route
00
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
,
down
from
000
in
0000
.

History
Henry
Miller
settled
in
the
area
in
August
0000
.

In
0000
,
Miller
's
Stagecoach
Station
was
established
before
the
coming
of
the
Oregon
Railway
and
Navigation
Company
rail
line
in
0000
,
and
was
plat
ted
in
0000
or
0000
.

It
soon
became
the
primary
shipping
point
for
the
cattle
country
to
the
south
.

Miller
built
the
Stage
Tavern
,
known
for
many
years
as
"
Miller
Station
"
.

It
was
on
the
overland
route
that
had
been
established
in
the
valley
,
and
had
become
well
known
to
all
who
traveled
in
pioneer
days
.

According
to
Oregon
Geographic
Names
,
Huntington
was
named
for
J.B.
and
J.M.
Huntington
,
brothers
who
purchased
Miller
's
holdings
in
0000
.

The
Huntingtons
maintained
a
small
trading
post
on
their
land
.

In
0000
,
the
rails
of
the
Oregon
Short
Line
and
the
Oregon
Railroad
and
Navigation
Company
line
were
joined
in
Huntington
.

Since
that
time
,
Huntington
has
been
an
important
railway
division
point
.

With
the
advent
of
the
railroad
came
J.T.
Fifer
,
who
had
been
selling
general
merchandise
to
the
construction
crews
moving
his
goods
from
town
to
town
as
the
work
progressed
.

Shortly
after
Fifer
arrived
,
the
Huntingtons

merchandise
,
a
blacksmith
shop
,
the

,
several

,
the
Northwest
Railroad
Company
began
extending
a
short
line
down
the
Snake
River
.

about
0000
.

increased
transportation
at

and
gave
an
outlet
for
Eagle

Pine
Valley
fruits
,
cattle
,
lumber
and
ore
.

line
was
flooded
by
water

Evidence
of
the
hardships

a
small
iron
cross
,
visible
from
Route

,
marks
the
location
where
Snake
River
Shoshone
Indians
killed
a
number
of
emigrants
in

.

At
the
turn
of
the
century
,
Huntington
developed
a
reputation
as
"
Sin
City
"
,
a
rugged
frontier
town
having
its
share
of
saloons
,
Chinese
opium
dens
,
and
gunslingers
.

Governor
Oswald
West
was
motivated
to
clean
up
the
city
,
along
with
the
community
of
Copperfield
,
in
0000-0000
