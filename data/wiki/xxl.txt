Falls
Township
is
a
township
in
Bucks
County
,
Pennsylvania

United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Portions
of
Fairless
Hills
and
Levittown
,
Pennsylvania
,
are
located
in
the
township
.

Portions
of
Falls
Township
are
mistakenly
called
Morrisville
,
due
to
the
location
of
the
Morrisville
Post
Office
outside
the
Borough
of
Morrisville
.

History
Dutch
settlements
here
were
established
as
early
as
0000
.

A
number
of
colonists
came
to
Falls
Township
before
William
Penn
founded
Pennsylvania
in
0000
,
including
William
Biles
.

Fallsington
is
the
only
settlement
of
this
period
which
has
been
in
continuous
use
.

Fallsington
is
an
example
of
a
crossroads
village
typical
of
the
time
.

The
Bucks
County
Courthouse
,
established
in
0000
,
is
said
to
have
been
located
in
Fallsington
until
it
was
moved
to
Bristol
in
0000
.

The
Friends
Meeting
,
whose
first
meetings
were
held
at
the
home
of
William
Biles
on
Biles
Island
,
found
a
site
for
a
brick
meeting
house
,
built
about
0000
in
Fallsington
on
of
land
that
had
been
donated
by
Samuel
Burges
.

Also
in
0000
,
Thomas
Janney
donated
of
land
to
be
used
as
the
Quaker
burial
grounds
for
Falls
Monthly
Meeting
.

William
Penn
donated
a
tract
of
,
for
a
Falls
commons
.

The
Township
itself
was
established
in
0000
.

Numerous
villages
were
located
within
the
township
,
with
Fallsington
being
the
center
of
social
and
commercial
activity
in
the
township
.

Morrisville
was
another
prominent
village
,
until
it
was
partitioned
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

Tullytown
was
also
a
village
until
it
was
partitioned
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

Other
villages
,
now
long
gone
,
included
Tyburn
,
Penn
Valley
,
Wheatsheaf
,
Slickville
,
Dogtown
,
Penns
Manor
and
Oxford
Valley
,
which
was
located
in
both
Falls
Township
and
Middletown
Township
.

The
growth
of
Fallsington
continued
,
with
the
construction
of
homes
,
an
inn
,
public
buildings
,
stores
,
and
small
craftsmen
's
shops
.

Until
the
construction
of
Fairless
Hills
and
Levittown
,
it
was
the
largest
village
in
the
Township
,
and
functioned
for
many
years
as
a
commercial
center
.

In
0000
,
William
Penn
began
construction
of
his
official
residence
,
Pennsbury
Manor
.

The
site
in
Falls
Township
was
chosen
for
its
easy
access
to
Philadelphia
along
the
Delaware
River
.

This
island
was
gradually
sold
by
Penn
's
heirs
and
the
last
original
building
was
destroyed
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
a
small
portion
of
the
original
site
was
purchased
by
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
and
reconstruction
of
Pennsbury
Manor
was
begun
.

Pennsbury
is
now
a
historical
site
,
open
to
the
public
.

It
was
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

The
proximity
of
major
transportation
systems
influenced
much
of
the
Township
's
development
.

The
earliest
of
these
was
the
Delaware
River
.

The
Township
is
located
at
the
upper
end
of
the
navigable
portion
of
the
river
.

In
0000
,
the
Provincial
Council
ordered
the
construction
of
the
King
's
Highway
,
which
ran
from
Philadelphia
to
Trenton
along
an
existing
Indian
trail
,
through
Bristol
,
Falls
,
and
Morrisville
.

The
King
's
Highway
still
exists
today
as
U.S.
Route
00
,
flowing
closely
the
original
configuration
.

Additional
roads
and
turnpikes
were
built
through
the
Township
in
the
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
.

Other
transportation
systems
were
laid
out
through
Falls
Township
in
the
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
.

The
Delaware
Canal
from
Easton
to
Bristol
was
opened
in
0000
.

A
railroad
line
from
Philadelphia
to
Trenton
via
Morrisville
was
built
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
rail
line
became
part
of
Pennsylvania
Railroad
's
main
New
York-Philadelphia
line
.

The
"
West
Trenton
"
cut-off
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
built
through
the
northern
part
of
the
Township
at
the
end
of
00th
century
.

These
rail
lines
now
accommodate
SEPTA
,
Amtrak
,
and
CONRAIL
passenger
and
freight
between
Philadelphia
and
Trenton
.

Rancher
,
the
Jubilee
,
the
Pennsylvanian
,
the
Colonial
and
the
Country
Clubber
,
with
only
modest
exterior
variations
.

The
homes
were
moderately
priced
and
required
only
a
low
down
payment
.

Construction
of
Levittown
began
in
February
0000
,
soon
after
completion
of
Levittown
,
New
York
,
located
on
Long
Island
.

Levittown
,
Pennsylvania
was
the
second
"
Levittown
"
built
by
William
J.
Levitt
,
who
is
often
credited
as
the
creator
of
the
modern
American
suburb
.

To
speed
up
construction
,
Levitt
&
Sons
perfected
a
00-step
rationalized
building
method
that
was
essentially
an
assembly
line
type
of
home
building
.

The
house
remained
stationary
,
while
the
construction
workers
moved
from
house
to
house
.

Each
worker
had
one
task
such
as
pouring
slabs
,
framing
,
installing
electric
sockets
or
installing
washing
machines
.

This
highly
regimented
process
enabled
Levitt
's
workers
to
produce
a
finished
house
every
00
minutes
.

Construction
of
the
homes
commenced
in
0000
and
when
completed
in
0000
,
00,000
homes
were
built
.

What
set
Levittown
apart
from
other
developments
at
the
time
was
that
it
was
built
as
a
complete
community
.

Levitt
&
Sons
designed
neighborhoods
with
traffic-calming
curvilinear
roads
,
in
which
there
were
no
four-way
intersections
.

Each
neighborhood
had
within
its
boundaries
a
site
donated
by
Levitt
&
Sons
for
a
public
elementary
school
.

Locations
for
churches
and
other
public
facilities
were
set
aside
on
main
thoroughfares
such
as
the
Levittown
Parkway
,
likewise
donated
by
the
builder
to
religious
groups
and
other
organizations
.

Other
amenities
included
Olympic-sized
public
pools
,
parks
,
"
greenbelts
"
,
baseball
fields
and
playgrounds
,
and
a
shopping
center
located
in
Tullytown
borough
that
was
considered
large
and
modern
at
the
time
of
its
construction
(
and
in
fact
was
the
largest
east
of
the
Mississippi
)
.

The
first
set
of
0
sample
homes
were
put
on
display
in
a
swatch
of
land
near
the
future
Levittown
Shop-a-Rama
,
and
an
estimated
00,000
people
viewed
them
in
that
first
weekend
.

Residents
(
who
are
sometimes
called
Levittowners
)
were
first
expected
to
comply
with
a
lengthy
list
of
rules
and
regulations
regarding
the
upkeep
of
their
homes
and
use
of
their
property
.

Two
of
these
"
rules
"
included
a
prohibition
on
hanging
laundry
out
to
dry
on
Sunday
and
not
allowing
homeowners
to
fence
off
their
yards
.

These
proved
unenforceable
over
time
,
particularly
when
backyard
pools
became
financially
accessible
to
the
working
class
and
privacy
concerns
drove
many
to
fence
off
their
yards
.

In
the
years
since
Levitt
&
Sons
ended
construction
,
three
-
and
four-story
"
garden
apartments
"
and
a
number
of
non-Levitt
owner-occupied
houses
have
been
built
in
Levittown
.

Levitt
&
Sons
would
not
sell
homes
to
African
American
s.
Levitt
did
not
consider
himself
to
be
a
racist
,
considering
housing
and
racial
relations
entirely
separate
matters
.

However
,
this
did
not
prevent
a
European-American
family
from
reselling
a
home
to
an
African-American
family
,
and
Levittown
's
first
black
couple
,
William
and
Daisy
Myers
,
bought
a
home
in
the
Dogwood
Hollow
section
in
0000
.

Their
move
to
Levittown
was
marked
with
racist
harassment
and
mob
violence
,
which
required
intervention
by
state
authorities
.

This
led
to
an
injunction
and
criminal
charges
against
the
harassers
while
Myers
and
their
supporters
refused
to
surrender
and
received
national
acclaim
for
their
efforts
.

For
instance
,
Daisy
Myers
has
been
hailed
as
"
The
Rosa
Parks
of
the
North
"
,
who
helped
expose
the
northern
states
'
problems
with
racial
inequality
of
that
time
.

Daisy
Myers
later
wrote
a
book
about
her
family
's
experiences
.

She
died
Dec.
0
,
0000
,
in
York
,
Pa.
.

The
community
's
otherwise
placid
exterior
was
again
disturbed
during
the
so-called
suburban
gas
riots
of
June
0000
in
the
wake
of
the
Camp
David
Peace
Accords
,
which
resulted
in
a
second
embargo
by
Arab
oil-producing
nations
.

The
unrest
occurred
June
00
–
00
,
0000
,
as
lines
swelled
and
tempers
flared
in
the
heart
of
Levittown
at
an
intersection
known
as
Five
Points
,
a
location
surrounded
by
six
service
stations
,
two
of
which
were
severely
damaged
by
vandalism
in
the
riots
.

The
two
days
of
riots
made
national
headlines
and
were
mentioned
(
although
not
directly
by
name
)
in
the
draft
of
an
address
to
the
nation
that
was
to
have
been
delivered
by
President
Jimmy
Carter
on
July
0
,
0000
.

A
baseball
team
from
Levittown
won
the
Little
League
World
Series
in
0000
.

Levittown
American
beat
an
opponent
from
Fort
Worth
,
Texas
,
to
win
the
honor
.

The
Levittown
Shopping
Center
(
known
officially
as
—
but
rarely
called
—
the
"
Levittown
Shop-a-Rama
"
)
,
located
in
Tullytown
,
was
unusually
designed
.

Two
parallel
strips
of
stores
faced
the
parking
lot
with
a
courtyard
that
had
green
spaces
,
benches
,
and
entrances
to
the
stores
.

The
center
had
one
large
anchor
department
store
(
Pomeroys
,
which
was
acquired
by
The
Bon-Ton
)
as
well
as
staple
stores
of
a
growing
suburban
demand
(
JC
Penney
,
Woolworth
's
,
Sears-just
hardware
)
.

The
shopping
center
began
a
slow
decline
in
the
mid-0000s
from
which
it
never
recovered
with
the
building
of
the
Oxford
Valley
Mall
.

The
mall
,
located
just
north
of
Levittown
,
in
Langhorne
in
Middletown
Township
,
drew
shoppers
away
from
the
older
Levittown
facility
,
given
Oxford
Valley
's
much
larger
size
and
enclosed
shopping
environment
.

In
0000
,
the
redeveloped
site
of
the
Shop-a-rama
was
reopened
as
the
Levittown
Town
Center
.

The
completed
facility
contains
of
retail
space
.

Of
the
five
public
pools
built
by
Levitt
&
Sons
and
operated
by
the
Levittown
Public
Recreation
Association
(
LPRA
)
,
four
were
closed
in
0000
with
the
exception
of
one
located
in
the
Pinewood
section
.

LPRA
Headquarters
(
and
other
landmarks
)
of
this
prototypical
post-war
suburb
of
sometimes
mythic
importance
have
been
the
focus
of
historic
preservation
efforts
.

Since
0000
,
studies
have
been
underway
to
establish
the
Levittown
Historic
District
.

Since
its
inception
in
0000
,
the
Bucks
County
St.
Patrick
's
Day
Parade
has
been
held
in
Levittown
.

Every
year
,
the
parade
steps
off
from
St
Joseph
the
Worker
Church
,
and
proceeds
two
miles
(
0
km
)
on
New
Falls
Road
to
Conwell-Egan
Catholic
High
School
.

Municipalities
and
sections
Levittown
is
not
an
incorporated
place
,
though
efforts
in
the
early
0000s
were
made
to
incorporate
.

Some
Levittown
residents
feared
that
incorporation
would
lead
to
higher
taxes
,
by
robbing
the
prospective
municipality
of
a
commercial
tax
base
.

Levittown
's
00
neighborhoods
(
locally
called
"
sections
"
)
are
found
in
parts
of
four
separate
municipalities
:
The
names
of
the
streets
within
each
section
uniformly
begin
with
the
same
letter
that
begins
the
name
of
the
section
in
question
except
for
the
section
of
Green
Lynn
,
which
was
not
constructed
by
Bill
Levitt
,

plan
that
offers
a
good
clue
as
to
where
any
particular
street
might
be
located
.
"

X

are
not
used
for
section
or
street
names
.

As
there
are
more
than
00
section

,
"

is
used
for
street
names
in

are
collectively
known
as
"
The
Gates
.
"

(
These
were
the
only
sections
without
sidewalks
so
as
to
lend
a
more
"
executive
"
appearance
to
the
neighborhoods
.

Geography
Levittown
is
located
at

Levittown
lies
in
the
southern
end
of
Bucks
County
(
"
Lower
Bucks
"
)
,
between
Philadelphia
and
Trenton
,
New
Jersey
;
Downtown
Philadelphia
(
"
Center
City
"
)
is
approximately

.

It
is
part
of
the
Philadelphia
metropolitan
area
(
an
area
also
known
generally
as
the
Delaware
Valley
)
.

It
is
adjacent
to
and
nearly
surrounds
Fairless
Hills
,
a
suburban
community
more
modest
in
scale
,
but
that
shares
many
of
Levittown
's
characteristics
.

Southeastern
Pennsylvania
Transportation
Authority
(
SEPTA
)
regional
rail
serves
Levittown
to
the
south
at
its
Levittown-Tullytown
station
,
and
to
the
north
at
its
Langhorne
and
Woodbourne
stations
.

Interstate
00
runs
to
the
north
and
west
of
Levittown
(
connecting
it
with
Philadelphia
and
the
suburbs
north
of
Trenton
)
;
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
runs
southwest
of
Levittown
(
connecting
it
with
the
western
suburbs
and
the
New
Jersey
Turnpike
)
,
and
U.S.
0
runs
to
the
north
,
carrying
traffic
directly
into
downtown
Trenton
.

The
nearest
international
airport
is
Philadelphia
International
Airport
(
Airport
Code
PHL
)
,
approximately
southwest
of
Levittown
.

The
nearest
Amtrak
station
is
just
across
the
Delaware
River
in
Trenton
,
just
over
to
the
east
.

Though
a
steel
mill
once
operated
by
U.S.
Steel
Corporation
provided
employment
in
nearby
Fairless
Hills
,
many
Levittowners
have
historically
commuted
by
automobile
or
train
to
Philadelphia
,
some
to
Trenton
,
still
others
to
more
distant
locales
in
as
many
as
four
states

Just
over
ten
percent
of
employed
Levittowners
both
live
and
work
in
the
community

Lower
Makefield
Township
is
a
township
in
Bucks
County

Development
and
Growth
Lower
Makefield
has
experienced
explosive
growth
over
the
past
decades
,
however
the
housing
crisis
severely
hit
the
township
during
the
0000s
,
and
development
slowed
considerably
,
resulting
in
a
slight
population
decrease
.

The
decrease
is
credited
to
the
many
college-aged
students
leaving
the
township
bound
for
college
.

The
housing
boom
of
the
nineties
resulted
in
a
large
increase
in
the
adolescent
population
,
who
have
now
have
reached
adulthood
and
left
the
township
.

[

Still
many
smaller
housing
developments
and
some
corporate
centers
have
been
constructed
since
0000
,
the
latter
especially
the
Stony
Hill
Road
corridor
around
I-00
,
beginning
with
office
complexes

to

followed
by

,

,
and
a
new
age-restricted
housing
complex
under
construction
at
000
Stony
Hill
Road
,
near
the
township
's
retail
district
.

However
,
the
township
has
been
well-planned
and
maintains
a
strong
balance
between
growth
and
preservation
,
and
is
considered
to
be
very
desirable
for
the
high
quality
of
life
it
offers
residents
.

On
December
00
,
0000
,
a
committee
was
formed
to
work
to
bring
a
veterans
monument
to
Lower
Makefield
Township
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
the
Lower
Makefield
Supervisors
unanimously
approved
designating
the
site
of
the
farmer
's
market
(
known
as
Pocket
Park
)
as
a
veterans
monument
.

On
November
0
,
Pocket
Park
was
officially
renamed
VETERANS
SQUARE
.

The
veterans
committee
has
committed
to
not
taking
township
tax
dollars
to
build
the
monument
and
relies
on
contributions
.

More
information
on
this
project
can

The
project
is
an
important

.

The

will
remain

History
Middletown
Township
began
as
a
farming
community
,
with
close
proximity
to
trading
towns
such
as
Langhorne
and
Newtown
.

There
are
not
many
significant
historical
places
located
in
the
township
apart
from
homes
and
farms
constructed
in
the
late
00th
century
.

Middletown
Township
was
sparsely
populated
before
0000
:
there
were
only
a
little
more
than
0,000
people
in
0000
,
compared
to
about
00,000
in
0000
.

Then
William
Levitt
began
his
second
Levittown
,
which
included
land
of
four
municipalities
,
including
that
of
Middletown
.

Twelve
developments
were
constructed
in
the
township
,
with
the
majority
of
them
containing
hundreds
of
homes
.

This
marked
the
first
planned
residential
development
in
the
township
.

Meanwhile
Langhorne
Terrace
was
being
constructed
out
of
the
Neshaminy
Woods
.

During
this
decade
,
the
township
grow
by
over
000
%
,
or
more
than
00,000
new
residents
.

As
the
decades
worn
on
,
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
acres
of
pristine
woods
,
rolling
countryside
,
and
productive
farms
continued
to
be
swallowed
into
homes
and
businesses
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
Oxford
Valley
Mall
was
constructed
,
and
at
the
time
was
named
the
country
's
largest
mall
for
a
short
time
.

Growth
continues
to
this
day
;
however
,
Middletown
has
taken
action
.

The
township
preserved
hundreds
of
acres
now
known
as
Core
Creek
Park
,
which
includes
the
sprawling
Lake
Luxembourg
.

Many
woodlands
and
a
few
farms
have
also
been
saved
.

The
township
has
transformed
from
a
bucolic
,
rural
area
to
a
highly
desirable
and
well-planned
community
,
with
low
crime
and
an
award-winning
school
district
.

This
is
why
the
township
is
still
seeing
a
growing
population
,
attracting
many
out-of-state
residents
and
international
migrants
.

Middletown
also
benefits
from
its
convenient
location
.

Located
in
the
near
center
of
the
county
,
Middletown
is
close
to
almost
any
other
municipality
nearby
,
including
the
cities
of
Philadelphia
,
Trenton
,
and
Princeton
.

Both
I-00
and
U.S.
0
pass
through
the
township
,
offering
its
residents
an
easy
commute
,
with
the
exception
of
rush
hour
traffic
,
which
too
has
been
greatly
reduced
and
continues
to
be
in
ongoing
road
projects
.

Edgemont
and
Harewood
and
Beechwood
are

Like
much
of
the
Delaware
Valley
,
Middletown
's
immigrant
population
is
skyrocketing
.

With
many
new
,
upscale
housing
developments
,
many
of
the
households
were
bought
by
foreign-born
residents
.

Middletown
's
immigrant
population
largely
consists
of
Indians
,
Koreans
,
Mexican
Americans
and
Russians
.

However
many
others
too
,
such
as
Chinese
,
Hispanics
,
and
Arabs
,
have
growing
numbers
.

Aside
from
European
immigration
,
Middletown
's
immigrant
population
has
mostly
arrived
after
0000
.

Politics
The
township
was
once
dominated
by
the
Republican
Party
like
most
of
Bucks
County
,
due
to
a
more
bucolic
,
rural
feel
.

However
after
years
of
growth
,
Democratic
Chairman
John
Toth
and
migration
of
peoples
from
Democratic
areas
,
the
area
has
been
trending
Democratic
rapidly
,
along
with
Bucks
County
.

The
Neshaminy
School
Board
and
Middletown
Township
Board
of
Supervisors
both
lack
a
one
party
dominance
,
which
used
to
be
mostly
or
all
Republican
.

In
the
0000
mid-term
elections
,
Ed
Rendell
(
Governor
)
,
Bob
Casey
(
U.S.
Senator
)
and
Chris
King
(
Pennsylvania
's
000nd
Representative
District
)
,
who
are
all
Democrats
won
the
township
.

The
heavily
battled
election
between
Mike
Fitzpatrick
and
Patrick
Murphy
for
the
0th
Congressional
district
was
split
00/00
like
much
of
the
area
.

Retail
The
Oxford
Valley
Mall
is
at
the
center
of
a
vibrant
commercial
retail
area
.

The
area
surrounding
the
mall
has
grown
and
has
changed
significantly
in
the
past
twenty
years
.

Mainly
car
dealerships
and
car
automotive
shops
were
once
the
only
structures
around
the
mall
.

Today
over
00
car
dealerships
remain
,
but
many
have
been
demolished
for
the
new
waves
.

Over
00
restaurant
chains
are
in
the
vicinity
,
along
with
many
major
retail
stores
,
such
as
Target
,
Best
Buy
,
Wal-Mart
,
Home
Depot
,
Staples
,
and
Barnes
and
Noble
.

A
surplus
of
furniture
stores
are
also
located
here
,
along
with
various
hotel
chains
,
a
major
hospital
,
and
office
buildings
.

Many
homes
have
been
constructed
around
the
mall
,
the
oldest
being
Langhorne
Gardens
,
a
branch
of
Levittown
,
Pennsylvania
.

Many
newly
constructed
townhouses
,
condos
,
and
large
singe-family
homes
have
been
built
.

Traffic
has
become
a
major
concern
.

Nearby
U.S.
0
and
Interstate
00
allow
commuters
to
congest
the
mall
area
roads
,
along
with
the
surplus
of
residents
in
the
area
.

Over
000,000
people
reside
less
than
ten
minutes
from
the
mall
,
plus
the
many
commuters
from
nearby
New
Jersey
.

Many
major
construction
projects
are
planned
for
the
major
access
roads
.

There
is
a
significant
,
and
fast-growing
foreign
presence
in
the
area
.

As
thousands
of
people
from
Asia
,
Europe
,
Latin
America
,
the
Middle
East
,
and
Africa
have
settled
near
the
mall
,
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
ethnic
food
,
churches
,
and
superstores
in
its
vicinity
.

Housing
Middletown
has
a
large
mix
of
housing
construction
and
time
periods
,
which
range
from
the
fifties
to
new
construction
.

Almost
all
the
development
that
occurred
in
the
fifties
were
the
Levittown
sections
.

Housing
ranges
from
cheap
single-family
housing
to
exorbitant
single-family
living
,
and
also
townhomes
,
condos
,
assisted
living
,
apartment
complexes
,
deluxe
apartment
complexes
,
and
00
+
housing
.

There
are
no
trailer
parks
in
Middletown
.

There
are
a
handful
of
homes
constructed
before
0000
,
even
a
few
dating
back
to
the
00th
century
,
however
they
are
individual
homes
and
scattered
,
due
to
Levittown
being
the
first
planned
development
.

The
most
significant
area
with
scattered
housing
periods
is
the
area
of
Parkland
.

Houses
date
from
every
decade
of
the
00th
century
,
and
the
00st
.

Parkland
has
the
lowest
land
value
and
family
incomes
than
any
other
area
of
Middletown
.

History
of
the
Middletown
Township
Police
Department
Middletown
Township
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
but
it
was
not
until
August
0000
that
a
full-time
police
department
was
established
with
the
hiring
of
Chief
Howard
C.
Shook
.

Chief
Shook
was
the
first
police
officer
and
police
chief
in
Middletown
Township
.

He
was
sworn
in
0/00/0000
and
worked
out
of
the
township
building
on
Hulmeville
Road
and
West
Richardson
Avenue
.

Chief
Shook
had
been
with
the
Pennsylvania
State
Police
prior
to
taking
control
of
the
newly
established
Middletown
Township
Police
Department
.

The
department
's
first
police
vehicle
,
a
0000
Ford
Deluxe
,
was
provided
to
Chief
Shook
in
October
0000
.

There
were
no
police
radios
before
0000
so
officers
had
an
interesting
way
of
learning
the
public
needed
assistance
.

If
the
public
needed
the
police
then
they
had
to
call
a
number
that
was
answered
by
an
employee
of
Penndel
Body
Works
.

Penndel
Body
Works
was
one
of
the
few
businesses
that
was
staffed
twenty-four
hours
a
day
.

The
police
officer
had
to
drive
past
Penndel
Body
Works
,
which
was
located
on
East
Lincoln
Highway
where
Bucks
County
International
is
currently
situated
,
and
look
to
see
if
a
signal
light
was
lit
.

If
the
light
was
lit
then
the
officer
knew
he
had
a
call
.

He
would
then
stop
in
to
the
business
and
get
the
call
.

In
0000
the
police
department
was
relocated
to
000
New
Rodgers
Road
.

The
police
department
shared
space
with
the
township
administration
in
the
new
building
that
was
built
at
a
cost
of
$
000,000
.

At
the
time
the
department
had
the
only
jail
with
air-conditioned
cells
in
the
county
.

There
were
fifteen
police
officers
on
the
force
when
they
moved
into
the
building
.

In
0000
an
addition
was
added
to
the
building
but
it
was
still
shared
by
the
township
administration
.

In
0000
the
township
purchased
a
new
building
at
0000
Trenton
Road
and
moved
the
township
administration
offices
to
that
location
.

The
police
department
then
took
over
the
entire
building
at
000
New
Rodgers
Road
.

In
the
spring
of
0000
,
both
the
police
department
and
the
township
offices
were
reunited
again
in
a
new
municipal
center
located
behind
the
Shoppes
at
Flowers
Mill
on
Municipal
Way
.

The
new
facility
houses
a
state
of
the
art
multi-media
training
room
,
and
an
indoor
firing
range
and
is
home
to
00
full-time
police
officers
and
administrative
staff
.

In
0000
Chief
Howard
Shook
retired
after
more
than
thirty
years
of
service
.

Chief
Shook
had
served
as
President
of
the
International
Chiefs
of
Police
Association
and
was
a
respected
member
of
the
law
enforcement
community
.

By
0000
the
police
force
had
grown
to
00
sworn
officers
,
including
the
Chief
,
(
0
)
Lieutenants
,
(
0
)
Sergeants
,
(
0
)
Detectives
and
(

)
Patrol
Officers
.

Lt.
James
Duncan
was
named
the
Acting
Chief
of
Police
from
0/0/00
until
0/0/00
when
Chief
Michael
J.
Chitwood
was
named
the
department
's
second
Chief
of
Police
.

Chief
Chitwood
had
previously
been
a
homicide
detective
in
Philadelphia
and
was
the
most
decorated
officer
in
that
department
's
history
.

He
served
as
Police
Chief
from
0/0/00
until
0/0/00
when
he
left
to
become
Chief
of
Police
in
Portland
,
Maine
.

Lt.
Frank
X.
McKenna
became
the
Acting
Chief
of
Police
and
in
0000
was
promoted
to
Chief
.

Chief
McKenna
was
hired
in
0000
and
worked
his
way
up
through
the
ranks
of
the
police
department
.

He
established
most
of
the
neighborhood
watch
associations
that

History
New

is
located
along
the
route
of
the
Old
York
Road
,
the
former
main
highway
between
Philadelphia
and
New
York
City
.

It
was
generally
regarded
as
the
halfway
point
,
where
travelers
would
stay
overnight
and
be
ferried
across
the
river
the
next
morning
.

Though
this
route
is
largely
obsolete
,
the
section
of
U.S.
Route
000
that
passes
just
north
of
town
still
bears
the
name
York
Road
.

The
original
route
is
now
known
as
Bridge
St.
(
PA

)
.

During
these
early
days
,
the
town
was
known
as
Coryell
's
Ferry
,
after
the
owner
of
the
ferry
business
.

The
current
name
came
into
use
following
a
large
fire
in

that
burned
down
several
mills
in
the
area
—
their
reconstruction
was
considered
a
"

for
the
area

While

History
Newtown
was
founded
by
William
Penn
in
0000
.

Newtown
was
one
of
several
towns
that
Penn
had
organized
around
Philadelphia
to
provide
country
homes
for
city
residents
and
to
support
farming
communities
.

It

seat
of

when
it
was
replaced
by
a

made
his
headquarters
in
Newtown
.

Newtown

Newtown

Geography
Newtown
is

at
(

,
−

.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
0.0
square
miles
(
0.0

)
,
all
of
it
land
.

The
Newtown
Creek
,
a
tributary
of
the
Neshaminy
Creek
,
runs
North
to
South
and
is
the
western
boundary
between
the
borough
and
the
township
of
Newtown
.

Transportation
Highways
State
Street
runs
through
Newtown
's
main
commercial
area
and
intersects
with
Washington
Avenue
at
the
borough
's
infrastructural
center
.

Pennsylvania
routes
000
,

and

converge
in
and
around

The
Newtown
Bypass
surrounds
the

Passenger
trains
Until
January
00
,
0000
,
Newtown
was
served
by
SEPTA
's
Fox
Chase/Newtown
Line
commuter
rail
service
.

At
that
time
,
service
was
suspended
because
of
failing
train
equipment
.

Since
then
,
there
has
been
constant
talk
of
reinstating
service
because
of
recent
strong
population
growth
in
the
surrounding
area
;
however
,
this
has
not
materialized
.

There
was
also
a
movement
under
way
to
convert
the
unused
rail
corridor
into
a
bike
trail
that
has
thus
far
been
unsuccessful
because
of
resistance
in
surrounding
communities
.

To
date
,
SEPTA
has
no
plans
to
restore
train
service
.

The
entire
issue
of
resuming
commuter
service
has
been
a
political
albatross
almost
from
the
day
the
trains
stopped
.

Newtown
remains
the
victim
in
all
the
political
squabbling
that
has
amassed
over
the
years
,
as
they
have
always
given
strong
support
of
returned
commuter
service
and
have
the
most
the
gain
.

Author
Joseph
Schwieterman
commented
in
0000
that
"
few
communities
experiencing
the
loss
of
service
have
engaged
in
as
protracted
a
dialogue
about
bringing
back
their
passenger
trains
as
Newtown
.

The
continuing
impasse
has
left
many
transit
advocates
skeptical
that
the
borough
will

"

However
,
in
September
0000
,
the
Southampton-based
Pennsylvania
Transit
Expansion
Coalition
(
PA-TEC
)
began
discussions
with
all
townships
along
the
rail
line
,
as
well
as
SEPTA
officials
,
about
possible
resumption
of
passenger
service
.

Bucks
County
officials
and
Newtown
residents
overwhelmingly
supported
PA-TEC
's
efforts
,
making
it
official
in
December
0000
when
the
Newtown
Board
of
Supervisor
passed
a
resolution
supporting
the
full
restoration
passenger
service
;
neighboring
Montgomery
County
officials
are
also
supportive
of
re-thinking
the
rail
corridor
as
well

built
the

Political
controversyIn
November
0000
,
Newtown
Democratic
Council
candidates
accused
SEPTA
board
Chairman
Pasquale
Deon
and
the
agency
’s
general
manager
,
Joe
Casey
,
of
improperly
meddling
in
borough
politics
regarding
use
of
the
Newtown
Station
site
parking
lot
.

Council
commented
that
SEPTA
's
involvement
“
is
yet
another
example
of
public
funds
and
resources
being
used
to
benefit
political
candidates
.

Documents
show
that
Republican
council
candidate
Paul
Salvatore
went
directly
to
the
chairman
of
SEPTA
,
a
prominent
Newtown
Republican
businessman
,
with
Democratic
literature
,
seeking
his
help
to
counter
it
.

And
he
got
it
,
with
the
SEPTA
general
manager
directed
to
send
a
letter
to
Newtown
Borough
attacking
the
Democratic
campaign
piece
.
"

The
dispute
had
begun
in
August
0000
when
the
Republican
challengers
in
Newtown
distributed
campaign
literature
that
highlighted
four
goals
,
one
of
which
was
a
plan
to
convert
the
Newtown
Station
parking
lot
into
basketball
and
tennis
courts
.

In
September
,
the
Democratic
incumbents
responded
,
noting
that
the
property
contained
“
environmental
hazards
,
”
which
would
have
to
be
cleaned
up
at
great
expense
and
recommended
the
town
seek
out
other
alternative
sites
for
recreation
.

Republican
Paul
Salvatore
contacted
Deon
,
a
longtime
friend
whom
he
had
discussions
with
on
the
SEPTA
site
prior
to
the
campaign
,
and
brought
the
new
Democratic
flier
to
his
attention
,
as
Deon
is
SEPTA
’s
board
chairman
.

Pennsylvania
state
law
forbids
Deon
from
being
involved
in
political
matters
due
to
the
fact
he
is
a
partner
in
the
Sands
Casino
in
Bethlehem
,
Pennsylvania
.

Newtown
Council
added
that
"
any
actions
that
he
took
on
behalf
of
the
residents
of
Newtown
Borough
he
did
in
his
capacity
as
Bucks
County
representative
to
SEPTA
.

”
Salvatore
had
attached
the
Democrats
’
campaign
literature
in
a
September
00
email
to
Deon
that
read
,
“
Check
out
the
literature
the
Democrats
are
putting
out
about
the
SEPTA
lot
.

It
implies
that
there
is
hazardous
waste
there
but
to
anyone
’s
knowledge
no
tests
have
ever
been
done
.

Please
contact
me
about
this
matter
.

”
The
following
day
Deon
forwarded
the
email
to
Jeffrey
Knueppel
,
chief
engineer
at
SEPTA
,
with
one
line
that
read
,
“
Please
get
me
something
quick
on
this
.

”
This
led
to
a
series
of
emails
among
SEPTA
officials
and
a
letter
dated
September
00
to
the
borough
signed
by
Casey
that
read
:
“
In
a
campaign
leaflet
being
circulated
by
two
candidates
for
election
to
the
Newtown
Borough
Council
,
there
is
an
allegation
that
unspecified
‘
environmental
hazards
’
exist
at
the
parking
lot
at
SEPTA
’s
Newtown
Station
.

”
The
letter
noted
there
is
no
indication
on
the
surface
of
any
environmental
issue
.

Determining
whether
there
is
an
issue
underneath
the
surface
would
require
subsurface
investigation
and
historical
search
,
the
letter
concluded
.

According
to
0000
Newtown
park
and
recreation
minutes
,
SEPTA
did
not
want
basketball
courts
on
the
property
because
of
liability
.

In
addition
,
borough
officials
requested
that
SEPTA
“
test
for
PCVP
contamination
which
would
have
a
definite
impact
on
whether
the
committee
would
recommend
the
redevelopment
of
the
lot
,
”
and
at
some
point
Joseph
Kelly
,
administrative
assistant
to
Deon
,
“
indicated
SEPTA
is
committed
to
cleaning
up
the
site
.

”
Meeting
minutes
state
that
SEPTA
“
discourage
(
s
)
disturbing
the
soil
,
digging
up
or
removing
the
existing
blacktop
or
adding
blacktop
to
the
site
....
SEPTA
would
permit
the
borough
to
cover
the
existing
blacktop
with
brick
.

”
In
addition
,
meeting
minutes
from
0000
state
that
the
borough
council
was
“
given
certain
constraints
by
SEPTA
who
preferred
that
the
borough
not
disturb
the
soil
.

”
Jane
Spector
,
who
designed
a
conceptual
plan
for
the
property
,
told
park
and
recreation
officials
that
“
a
condition
of
the
lease
is
that
there
would
be
no
remediation
of
soils
by
SEPTA
,
nothing
that
,
considering
the
property
’s
history
,
soils
should
not
be
moved
or
disturbed
;
no
soils
test
have
been
done
,
”
according

from

Deon
and
Casey
did
not
respond
to
the

Times
when
questioned
about

actions

about

The
population
was

at

census

History
Northampton
Township
was
originally
settled
by
English
colonists
who
came
with
William
Penn
on
his
voyage
to
Pennsylvania
.

They
named
it
after
Northampton
,
the
county
town
of
Northamptonshire
,
England
.

Northampton
Township
was
incorporated
in
0000

Geography
According
to
the
United

Census
Bureau
,
the
township
has
a
total
area
of
00.0
square

(

,

and
0.0
square

(

)
of
it
(
0.00
%
)
is
water
.

It
is
drained
by
the
Neshaminy
Creek
,
which
forms
its
entire
NE
boundary
,
into
the
Delaware
River
.

The
township
is
made
up
of
the
following
unincorporated
communities
and
census-designated
places
:
Passenger
trains
The
communities
of
Holland
and
Churchville
had
commuter
train
service
until
January
0000
via
SEPTA
's
Fox
Chase-Newtown
Rapid
Transit
Line
.

Service
was
"
temporarily
"
suspended
due
to
failing
train
equipment
resulting
in
poor
ridership
.

While
Churchville
Station
has
been
restored
,
Holland
station
was
demolished
in
0000
.

In
the
ensuing
years
(
particularly
post-0000
)
,
there
has
been
heavy
interest
in
resuming
passenger
service
by
Bucks
County
officials
.

Several
housing
booms
throughout
the
0000s
and
0000s
have
resulted
in
homes
being
situated
directly
adjacent
to
the
dormant
rail
line
.

Though
there
is
overwhelming
support
from
a
majority
of
residents
looking
for
better
public
transportation
options
,
several
residents
along
Old
Jordan
Road
in
Holland
have
voiced
NIMBY
opposition
to
the
reactivation
of
regular
passenger
service
.

Though
rail
service
was
initially
replaced
with
a
Fox
Chase-Newtown
shuttle
bus
,
patronage
remained
light
.

The
replacement
bus
service
was
far
slower
and
less
convenient
than
the
train
service
it
replaced
,
resulting
in
the
shuttle
bus
being
very
unpopular
.

The
travelling
public
never
saw
a
bus
service
as
a
suitable
replacement
for
a
rail
service
.

History
Penndel
Borough
,
although
small
,
is
rich
in
history
.

The
area
,
originally
inhabited
by
the
Lenape
Indians
,
was
settled
by
Thomas
Langhorne
,
an
English
Quaker
preacher
,
and
by
Henry
Paulin
,
a
Quaker
Yeoman
,
on
land
grants
from
William
Penn
.

Penndel
remained
a
farming
region
until
0000
when
the
Philadelphia
Reading
Railroad
began
service
,
and
the
Langhorne
train
station
was
established
.

Slowly
individual
homes
and
small
businesses
were
built
within
close
proximity
to
the
railroad
,
and
the
town
expanded
from
there
.

It
began
as
the
Eden
Post
Office
,
was
incorporated
as
the
borough
of
Attleboro
in
0000
;
the
name
changed
to
South
Langhorne
in
0000
,
and
finally
to
Penndel
in
0000
.

Today
Penndel
has
both
a
thriving
industrial
district
and
residential
areas
with
both
new
and
historically
significant
homes
.

One
of
the
most
notable
and
historically
significant
events
in
early
00th
century
American
History
was
The
Battle
of
Bellevue
.

The
Battle
of
Bellevue
,
fought
August
0
,
0000
,
marked
the
final
push
of
the
Lenape
Indians
to
maintain
their
land
from
American
control
.

The
summer
of
0000
brought
a
great
drought
,
which
forced
the
Lenape
Indians
to
compete
for
resources
from
local
farmers
.

After
the
Lenape
ambush
on
the
Lodise
family
farm
during
the
night
of
July
00
,
0000
,
a
militia
of
Penndel
farmers
retaliated
against
the
Lenape
Indians
on
the
Hill
of
Bellevue
.

The
Battle
of
Bellevue
was
fought
where
Bellevue
Ave
now
lies
.

The
militia
front
lines
being
where
Big
Marty
's
and
Penndel
Pizza
now
stands
,
and
the
Lenape
Indians
stronghold
where
the
Thrift
Store
and
the
Irish
Rover
now
stand
.

The
battle
killed
00
Lenape
Indian
lives
and
0
militiamen
.

The
Battle
of
Bellevue
was
the
final
battle
on
the
East
Coast
of
North
America
against
Native
Americans
.

A
common
figure
of
speech
in
Penndel
is
"
never
forget
the
Battle
of
Bellevue
"
,
an
echo
of
how
much
a
small
group
of
determined
men
can
achieve
from
a
forgotten
past
.

Transportation
The
borough
's
nearest
airport
is
located
just
north
of
the
center
of
town
,
and
is
actually
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
East
Rockhill
Township
border
.

Pennridge
Airport
is
a
public
general
aviation
airport
with
one
-
long
runway
.

Perkasie
was
once
served
by
the
Reading
Railroad
's
North
Penn
Division
,
also
known
as
the
Bethlehem
Branch
,
which
was
once
part
of
the
North
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

That
main
line
is
now
owned
by
SEPTA
,
however
,
passenger
service
was
terminated
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
last
SEPTA-operated
Philadelphia
bound
passenger
train
through
Perkasie
occurred
on
July
00
,
0000
.

After
passenger
service
was
terminated
,
Conrail
continued
operations
out
of
Lansdale
up
to
Quakertown
until
the
mid
00
's
.

The
East
Penn
Railroad
,
formally
known
as
East
Penn
Railway
(
EPRY
)
,
leased
a
portion
of
this
railroad
from
SEPTA
saving
the
line
from
abandonment
from
Telford
through
to
Quakertown
.

SEPTA
has
recently
issued
a
formal
proposal
to
perform
maintenance
on
the
line
and
run
passenger
service
back
on
it
,
but
they
have
not
decided
between
installing
catenary
for
electric
trains
and
using
diesel
trains
that
would
connect
to
the
Lansdale/Doylestown
Line
in
Lansdale
.

The
project
is
estimated
to
take
at
least
five
years
.

Currently
as
of
the
end
of

,
unmarked
freight
cars
,
particularly
covered
hoppers
,
are
now
parked
and
being
stored
along
the

track
in
Perkasie
between
Market

,
from

History
Both
the
town
of
Perkasie
and
Pocasie
Creek
come
from
the
Lenape
word
Poekskossing
[
or
Pokesing
]
,
meaning
'
where
the
hickory
nuts
were
cracked
.
'

There
was
doubtless
a
village
on
the
site
of
the
present
town
before
William
Penn
’s
Perkasie
Manor
was
settled
.
"
"

The
"
Manor
"
of
Perkasie
was
one
of
several
in
Bucks
County
and
contained
00,000
acres
.

Laid
out
and
surveyed
in
0000
it
embraced
most
of
Hilltown
and
Rockhill
Township
.
"

On
June
0
,
0000
,
a
disastrous
fire
began
at
the
livery
stable
located
at
0th
and
Chestnut
Streets
;
twelve
buildings
were
destroyed
.

Personal
buckets
and
ladders
were
used
to
extinguish
the
fire
.

Less
than
a
month
later
,
on
July
0
,
0000
,
a
committee
appointed
by
Perkasie
Borough
Council
met
to
form
the
Hope
Fire
Company
.

On
September
0
,
0000
,
the
Hope
Fire
Company
met
at
Groover
's
Hall
(
000
Chestnut
Street
)
and
adopted
a
constitution
and
by-laws
;
00
members
were
present
.

At
the
same
time
,
Borough
Council
turned
over
to
the
fire
company
a
hand
pumper
purchased
from
Newtown
Fire
Association
,
and
a
hose
cart
purchased
from
Philadelphia
with
000
feet
of
hose
.

One
month
later
the
Philadelphia
&
Reading
Railroad
presented
the
Fire
Company
with
a
tire
for
a
steam
locomotive
driver
wheel
for
use
as
a
fire
alarm
.

This
was
installed
in
a
cupola
of
the
Groover
building
(
now
in
front
of
Silverdale
Fire
Company
)
.

Perkasie
is
home
to
a
former
major
league
baseball
factory
,
now
out
of
business
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
the
factory
produced
millions
of
baseballs
through
the
Hubbert
/
Spalding
contract
.

The
factory
still
stands
today
,
at
000
Chestnut
Street
,
but
had
been
converted
into
the
Senior
Citizens
Center
.

[

]
The
Senior
Center
has
since
moved
to
the
neighboring
borough
of
Silverdale
.

The
old
Senior
Center
is
scheduled
to
be
converted
to
six
two-bedroom
condominiums
by
Habitat
for
Humanity
of
Bucks
County
.

The
goal
of
this
project
is
to
keep
the
exterior
integrity
intact
and
combine
old
world
charm
with
green
building
techniques
the
new
living
space
.

The
Pearl
S.
Buck
House
at
Green
Hills
Farm
,
which
is
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
,
is
located
near
Perkasie
in
Hilltown
Twp
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
about
00
percent
of
the
town
,
including
many
historic
buildings
,
was
burned
down
in
what
became
known
as
The
Great
Perkasie
Fire
.

This
massive
fire
was
started
by
two
00-year-old
boys
who
were
playing
with
a
lighter
near
the
coal
bins
behind
the
Shelley
&
Sons
lumberyard
at
Seventh
and
Market
Streets
.

The
fire
was
fought
by
about
000
firefighters
who
came
from
over
00
fire
companies
in
three
counties
.

Among
the
historic
buildings
lost
were
the
American
House
and
the
Moyer-Kantner
Funeral
Home
,
both
dating
from
0000
,
and
the
Herstine
Building
.

One
of
the
buildings
was
the
J.G.
Moyer
building
.

The
building
graced
the
cover
of
a
0000
edition
of
The
Saturday
Evening
Post
.

It
depicted
an
artistic
rendition
of
a
Fourth
of
July
parade
by
artist
John
Falter
.

Despite
the
size
of
the
fire
,
no
fatalities
were
reported
.

Immediately
after
the
fire
,
a
group
of
concerned
business
owners
,
residents
and
borough
officials
formed
a
Downtown
Restoration
Task
Force
.

The
Task
Force
was
given
the
name
of
the
Perkasie
Towne
Improvement
Association
(
PTIA
)
.

This
group
was
the
forerunner
to
the
Perkasie
Olde
Towne
Association
.

The
PTIA
along
with
Perkasie
's
local
government
were
responsible
for
the
three-phase
town
improvement
plan
that
was
completed
over
the
next
five
intervening
years
.

The
PTIA
's
focus
was
to
oversee
the
reconstruction
of
not
only
the
area
of
the
town
center
affected
by
the
fire
,
but
also
other
retail
and
residential
areas
in
the
central
part
of
the
Borough
.

As
a
result
of
these
efforts
,
streetscape
enhancements
of
decorative
street
lights
,
underground
utilities
,
new
sidewalks
with
decorative
brick
borders
were
built
and
new
benches
,
trash
receptacles
and
street
trees
were
placed
throughout
the
focus
area
.

Taking
into
consideration
the
two
major
fires
in
the
Perkasie
area
,
there
may
have
been
complications
related
to
the
fires
itself
that
resulted
in
deaths
afterwards
.

The
South
Perkasie
Covered
Bridge
was
listed
on

Sellersville
is
a
borough
in
Bucks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Sellersville
is
part
of
Pennridge
School
District
.

History
Sellersville
began
in
the
early
00th
century
.

It
was
centered
on
a
major
road
known
as
Bethlehem
Pike
that
connected
Philadelphia
to
Bethlehem
and
the
rest
of
what
was
then
far
Western
Pennsylvania
.

The
town
was
very
small
and
its
most
notable
feature
was
a
large
inn
.

The
Inn
is
today
called
the
Washington
House
because
it
is
believed
to
have
been
visited
at
least
once
by
George
Washington
during
the
Revolutionary
War
.

The
town
grew
slowly
over
the
years
until
the
Industrial
Revolution
.

In
the
0000s
the
North
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
built
,
running
parallel
to
Bethlehem
Pike
:
this
stimulated
the
growth
of
light
textile
industries
and
brought
a
wave
of
population
growth
.

The
East
Branch
of
the
Perkiomen
Creek
runs
through
the
town
which
connects
it
to
an
adjacent
town
of
Perkasie
.

This
creek
was
dammed
in
the
early
00th
century
creating
a
small
body
of
water
known
as
Lake
Lenape
.

Along
the
length
of
the
lake
a
park
was
built
on
Perkasie
and
Sellersville
lands
.

In
the
0000s
and
0000s
this
park
housed
a
carousel
,
a
roller
coaster
and
several
other
amusements
.

The
railroad
brought
hundreds
of
people
from
Philadelphia
in
the
summer
time
,
and
it
became
a
well
known
vacation
spot
for
blue
collar
city
workers
.

Today
the
town
is
still
relatively
small
,
sandwiched
in
between
a
ridge
line
and
the
larger
town
of
Perkasie
.

The
center
of
town
still
runs
along
Bethlehem
Pike
which
is
now
called
Old
Route
000
.

The
Washington
House
still
stands
and
has
recently
been
restored
to
become
an
upscale
restaurant
.

The
creek
is
still
dammed
but
only
the
carousel
in
Perkasie
remains
of
the
amusements
.

The
textile
industry
has
long
moved
out
of
the
area
and
Sellersville
has
become
mainly
a
residential
town
for
people
working
in
the
many
urban
centers
that
are
only
a
short
commute
away
.

The
addition
of
Grandview
Hospital
on
the
ridgeline
overlooking
Sellersville
has
provided
some
local
jobs
.

The
town
is
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
open
country
and
spread
out
housing
developments
.

The
local
firehouse
provides
various
activities
throughout
the
year
,
including
a
carnival
in
the
summer
.

The
Holiday
House
Pool
and
Recreation
Center
becomes
a
hotspot
for
people
to
escape
the
heat
during
the
summer
as
well
.

There
are
various
business
along
Main
Street
one
of
which
is
the
Washington
House
.

This
strip
of
businesses
along
Main
Street
provide
some
jobs
as
well
,
but
largely
the
town
remains
a
residential
area
.

There
is
a
Sellersville
Museum
off
of
Main
Street
which
displays
different
exhibits
every
month
.

The

Passenger
trains
Upper
Southampton
had
two
commuter
rail
stations
until
February
0000
.

Service
was
"
temporarily
"
suspended
due
to
a
lack
of
ridership
along
the
line
.

The
train
station
has
since
been
restored
and
is
now
a
private
residence
.

In
the
ensuing
years
(
particularly
post-0000
)
,
there
has
been
interest
in
resuming
passenger
service
by
Bucks
County
officials
;
however
,
neighboring
Montgomery
County
officials
are
staunchly
opposed
to
it
.

Though
rail
service
was
initially
replaced
with
a
Fox
Chase-Newtown
shuttle
bus
,
patronage
remained
light
.

The
replacement
bus
service
was
far
slower
and
less
convenient
than
the
train
service
it
replaced
,
resulting
in
the
shuttle
bus
being
very
unpopular
.

The
travelling
public
never
saw
a
bus
service
as
a
suitable
replacement
for
a
rail
service
.

History
This

formerly
served
as
the
civilian
housing
area
for
the
long-defunct
Brewster
Aeronautical
Corporation
,
established
in
0000
,
while
the
area
was
still
referred

as
Johnsville
.

It
later
became

Naval
Air
Development
Center

,
Warminster
prior

decommissioned
and
closed

History
Wrightstown
's
first
settler
was
John
Chapman
,
who
emigrated
from
England
in
October
0000
,
with
his
wife
and
children
and
settled
on
land
which
was
part
of
the
original
William
Penn
Grant
.

According
to
legend
,
they
first
lived
in
a
"
cave
"
or
"
sod
hut
"
,
probably
on
what
is
now
Penns
Park
Road
.

Twin
boys
were
born
in
their
dwelling
during
the
first
winter
,
originating
a
long
life
of
descendants
,
among
whom
was
Henry
Chapman
Mercer
.

Although
the
first
dwelling
no
longer
exists
,
there
are
seven
houses
in
the
Township
which
were
the
homes
of
second
and
third
generation
Chapmans
.

William
Smith
,
who
arrived
the
year
after
the
Chapmans
,
built
a
log
house
which
still
stands
on
Mud
Road
.

In
addition
to
the
Smith
house
,
there
are
000
other
houses
in
the
Township
which
are
at
least
000
years
old
.

The
boundaries
of
the
Township
were
established
by
0000
.

A
square
mile
in
the
center
,
in
the
present
Penns
Park
,
was
reserved
for
parkland
.

However
,
in
0000
,
this
was
divided
among
the
surrounding
property
owners
.

In
addition
to
its
basically
rural
character
,
much
of
the
Wrightstown
Township
's
charm
is
due
to
its
five
villages
:
Penns
Park
,
Pineville
,
Rushland
,
Wrightstown
and
Wycombe
.

Each
village
at
one
time
contained
its
own
post
office
,
a
rather
distinctive
facet
of
life
in
the
Township
.

Today
,
all
but
the
Wrightstown
Post
Office
remain
,
with
home
delivery
available
to
approximately
00
%
of
the
Township
through
the
Newtown
Post
Office
.

A
small
portion
of
the
township
is
served
with
home
mail
delivery
through
the
Furlong
Post
Office
in
neighboring
Buckingham
Township

History
Yardley
was
founded
by
William
Yardley
,
who
immigrated
to
America
in

,
0000
with
his
family
.

He
made
an
agreement
with
William
Penn
,
before
leaving
England
,
to
buy
for
ten
pounds
.

A
survey
was
completed
in
October
0000
,
and
the
area
William
Yardley
settled
was
called
"
Prospect
Farm
.
"

It
was
located
just
outside
of
the
present
Yardley
Borough
.

William
Yardley
died
in
0000
,
and
his
family
in
0000-0000
,
possibly
of
smallpox
.

The

's
burial
plots
are
located
in
Slate
Hill
Cemetery
,
one
of
the
oldest
Quaker
burial
grounds
in
the
state

settle
the
estate
and
never
returned
to
England
.

the

a
spoke
and
handle
factory
,

post
office
,

,
used
the
name
"
Yardleyville
.
"

The
name
became
"
Yardley
"
again
at
the
time
the
Reading
Railroad
came
through
the
area
in
0000
.

During
the
American
Civil
War
,
Yardley
was
a
station
for
the
Underground
Railroad
,
an
escape
route
for
slaves
.

Known
hiding
places
were
under
the
eaves
of
the
Continental
Hotel
(
now
the

,
in
bins
of
warehouses

Butler
is
city
and
county
seat
of
Butler
County
in
the
US
state
of
Pennsylvania
,
situated
north
of
Pittsburgh
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
population
was
00,000
.

Butler
was
named
the
0th
best
small
town
in
America
by
Smithsonian
Magazine
in
May
0000
.

History
Butler
was
named
for
Maj.
Gen.
Richard
Butler
,
who
fell
at
the
Battle
of
the
Wabash
,
also
known
as
St.
Clair
's
Defeat
,
in
western
Ohio
in
0000
.

In
0000
John
and
Samuel
Cunningham
became
the
first
settlers
in
the
village
of
Butler
.

After
settling
in
Butler
,
the
two
brothers
laid
out
the
community
by
drawing
up
plots
of
land
for
more
incoming
settlers
.

By
0000
,
the
community
was
incorporated
into
a
borough
.

The
first
settlers
were
of
Irish
or
Scottish
descent
and
were
driving
westward
from
Connecticut
.

In
0000
the
German
immigrants
began
arriving
,
with
Detmar
Basse
settling
in
Jackson
Township
in
0000
and
founding
Zelienople
the
following
year
.

After
George
Rapp
arrived
in
0000
and
founded
Harmony
,
larger
numbers
of
settlers
followed
.

John
A.
Roebling
settled
Saxonburg
in
0000
,
by
which
time
most
of
the
county
was
filled
with
German
settlers
.

Throughout
most
of
its
history
,
the
city
of
Butler
has
been
a
major
manufacturing
and
industrial
center
.

In
0000
,
the
Standard
Steel
Car
Company
opened
one
of
its
largest
railcar
manufacturing
facilities
in
Butler
.

It
was
here
that
some
of
the
first
all
steel
rail
cars
were
built
.

Diamond
Jim
Brady
,
the
legendary
financier
,
gourmand
and
gemophile
,
got
his
start
here
in
0000
when
he
established
the
Standard
Steel
Car
Company
,
which
merged
with
the
Pullman
Palace
Car
Company
in
0000
to
create
Pullman-Standard
,
a
monopoly
that
was
eventually
broken
by
the
government
.

The
Pullman-Standard
plant
closed
in
0000
,
and
was
demolished
in
0000
.

The
site
is
now
occupied
by
a
strip
mall
,
as
well
as
the
new
Butler
Transit
Authority
intermodal
facility
.

In
0000
the
BTA
moved
a
covered
hopper
railcar
to
the
bus
terminal
in
recognition
of
the
former
Pullman-Standard
plant
.

The
car
was
built
at
the
facility
in
0000
.

Another
notable
business
headquartered
in
the
city
was
the
American
Austin
Car
Company
(
0000
–
00
)
.

The
modern
Jeep
was
created
by
the
company
when
it
was
later
called
American
Bantam
Car
Company
.

The
first
prototypes
of
the
vehicle
were
manufactured
at
the
Butler
facility
.

Big
military
contracts
eventually
went
to
Willys
and
Ford
,
and
the
Bantam
factory
failed
during
World
War
II
.

Bantam
was
also
an
early
producer
of
small
fuel-efficient
vehicles
.

Butler
is
home
to
one
of
the
few
original
Ford
dealers
left
that
Henry
Ford
authorized
when
he
created
the
first
car
dealers
.

In
the
0000s
,
Butler
became
one
of
the
first
cities
to
install
bells
at
cross
walks
,
a
common
practice
today
.

The
city
was
linked
to
Pittsburgh
via
Mars
in
0000
by
the
Pittsburgh
and
Butler
Street
Railway
and
to
Evans
City
in
0000
by
the
Pittsburgh
,
Harmony
,
Butler
and
New
Castle
Railway
,
both
interurban
trolley
lines
.

The
Mars
route
closed
in
April
0000
,
followed
by
the
Evans
City
line
on
August
00
,
0000
with
the
trolleys
replaced

History
Callery
is
located
in
the
northwestern
corner
of
Adams
Township
,
Pennsylvania
.

It
was
established
in
0000
,
with
the
post
office
opening
in
0000
.

The
original
village
suffered
a
disaster
in
0000
when
most
of
the
community
was
lost
to
a
fire
;
however
,
with
the
area
being
a
major
rail
hub
,
many
of
the
structures
were
rebuilt
.

The
community
was
incorporated
into
a
borough
in
0000
.

Railroad
center
Located
along
the
P&W
Subdivision
,
the
borough
was
originally
a
small
whistle
stop
on
the
Pittsburgh
and
Western
Railroad
.

However
,
by
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
,
Callery
became
a
prosperous
railroad
community
with
the
completion
of
the
Northern
Subdivision
.

connected
with
the
P&W
Sub
.

in
Callery
,
creating
a
new
railroad
junction
.

The
Northern
Sub
ran
from
the
junction
to
the
village
of
Ribold
outside
of
Butler
,
Pennsylvania
.

This
new
connection
turned
Callery
into
a
major
hub
for
the
B&O
,
and
for
the
next
three
decades
it
would
be
called
Callery
Junction
.

By
the
0000s
,
a
new
connection
was
completed
at
Eidenau
which
eliminated
the
sharp
curves
and
grades
to
Ribold
.

Soon
after
,
traffic
on
the
old
connection
ceased
,
and
Callery
Junction
was
no
more
.

Trains
from
the
Buffalo
and
Pittsburgh
Railroad
still
pass
the
small
borough
today
,
but
the
junction
has
been
gone
for
almost
eighty
years

+
tonne
meteorite
exploded
approximately
twelve
miles
above
the

fragments
of
the
meteorite
were
found
following

investigations
.

They
had
masses
000g
and
00g
,
and
were
discovered
some
miles
short
of
the
calculated
point
of
impact
of
the
main
mass
–
which
is
yet
to
be
found
.

Two
more
small
fragments
were
found

History
Cranberry
Township
was
founded
in
0000
.

It
is
not
to
be
confused
with
Cranberry
Township
in
Venango
County
,
formerly
Fairfield
Township
(
founded
0000
)
,
which
is
located
only
away
.

In
0000
,
the
Cranberry
Township
Historical
Society
was
founded
.

The
most
populated
section
of
the
township
was
originally
known
as
Criders
Corners
.
"

Criders
Corners
"
referred
to
the
junction
of
the
old
Perry
Highway
(
now
Dutilh
Road
)
and
the
Old
Mars-Criders
Road
(
now
bypassed
in
favor
of
Pennsylvania
Route
000
)
.

The
crossroads
was
named
for
Jacob
Crider
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
a
trustee
of
Dutilh
United
Methodist
Church
,
who
purchased
of
land
there
in
0000
.

The
township
's
current
name
is
derived
from
the
cranberry
bogs
which
could
be
found
in
the
area
in
days
past
.

The
township
also
includes
part
of
the
considerably
smaller
former
town
of
Ogle
,
and
other
small
areas
formerly
known
as
Fernway
and
Fox
Run
.

One
reason
for
the
township
's
tremendous
growth
is
its
location
.

Serving
as
the
intersection
of
Interstate
00
(
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
)
and
00
and
Routes
00
and
000
,
the
community
is
accessible
from
virtually
anywhere
.

In
addition
,
the
completion
of
Interstate
000
in
0000
cut
travel
time
to
Pittsburgh
to
under
half
an
hour
.

The
first
church
in
Cranberry
Township
was
Plains
Presbyterian
Church
,
which
was
founded
in
0000
.

George
Washington
,
and
Christopher
Gist
reportedly
traveled
through
Cranberry
Township
prior
to
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

Transportation
Interstate
00
and
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
via
Interstate
00
run
through
Cranberry
Township
.

US
Route
00
and
Pennsylvania
Route
000
are
also
important
main
roads
in
the
municipality
.

These
four
roads
are
connected
by
a
newly-completed
interchange
:
the
$
00.0
million
,
joint
PennDOT
/
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
venture
,
named
the
"
Cranberry
Connector
Project
,
"
was
local
nuisance
for
several
years
,
but
after
opening
in
early
0000
has
effectively
provided
direct
,
non-stop
connection
between
the
heavily-traveled
roads
.

Additionally
,
the
northern
terminus
of
Interstate
000
,
an
important
artery
that
serves
as
the
parkway
north
of
Pittsburgh
,
is
located
a
few
miles
south
of
the
township
.

Cranberry
Township
is
also
the
location
of
the
northernmost
bus
service
lines
of
the
Port
Authority
of
Allegheny
County
;
however
,
some
of
these
bus
lines
may
be
cut
in
upcoming
Port
Authority
service
reductions
.

Business
Cranberry
Township
is
one
of
the
fastest-growing
areas
in
the
United
States
in
both
population
and
business
.

While
many
residential
communities
are
being
built
,
even
more
so
are
retail
stores
.

One
of
the
busiest
business
centers
is
at
the
Cranberry
Mall
.

A
few
of
the
stores
at
the
mall
include
a
Giant
Eagle
,
Hallmark
Cards
,
and
Cranberry
Cinemas
theater
(
formerly
Carmike
Cinemas
)
.

Cranberry
Township
is
also
home
to
the
Thorn
Hill
Industrial
Park
,
where
many
businesses
are
headquartered
,
including
the
Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review
—
whose
NewsWorks
warehouse
prints
that
paper
as
well
as
the
USA
Today
for
the
Pittsburgh
area
—
and
,
until
0000
,
clothing
company
American
Eagle
Outfitters
's
headquarters
was
located
in
the
nearby
municipality
of
Marshall
Township
(
The
company
has
now
relocated
its
headquarters
to
the
South
Side
in
the
city
of
Pittsburgh
)
.

In
0000
,
Wellington
Energy
,
a
sub-division
of
Wellington
Power
Corporation
located
in
Lawrenceville
,
opened
in
Cranberry
and
is
continuing
to
grow
as
a
leader
in
Electric
&
Gas
Meter
AMR
Deployment
and
Project
Management
.

Additionally
,
Parkvale
Bank
has
a
thriving
branch
in
the
Cranberry
Mall
.

Cranberry
Township
is
slowly
becoming
the
heart
of
a
regional
retail
center
.

In
years
past
,
Cranberry
Township
had
no
post
office
of
its
own
,
so
residents
and
businesses
located
there
shared
ZIP
codes
with
many
surrounding
cities
and
towns
(
such
as
nearby
Mars
and
Evans
City
)
.

Subsequently
,
their
mailing
addresses
were
quite
confusing
,
with
many
people
proclaiming
the
need
for
their
own
ZIP
code
.

Cranberry

History
Evans
City
is
the
name
given
in
0000
at
the
city
’s
incorporation
of
a
borough
of
an
old
settlement
.

It
is
situated
on
Breakneck
Creek
,
on
the
township
line
,
and
was
formerly
partly
in
Jackson
and
partly
in
Forward
townships
.

Its
site
was
for
a
long
time
a
favorite
camping
ground
for
the
Indians
,
who
named
the
creek
Big
Beaver
run
;
while
the
French
knew
it
as
Casse-cou-anse
or
Breakneck
creek
,
--
a
name
adopted
by
travelers
between
Fort
Duquesne
and
Fort
Machault
,
and
by
the
English
speaking
pioneers
of
the
original
township
of
Connoquenessing
,
Pennsylvania
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
the
location
was
often
called
Boggs
'
Mill
,
and
in
later
years
Evansburg
,
after
Thomas
B.
Evans
,
who
purchased
and
rebuilt
the
original
Bogg
’s
mill
.

In
0000
it
was
a
little
hamlet
,
credited
with
a
population
of
00
people
.

in
0000
,
there
were
000
persons
enumerated
in
the
census
,
and
at
the
beginning
of
0000
,
it
was
generally
credited
with
a
population
of
approximately
0,000
.

In
October
0000
,
the
railroad
was
completed
to
Evans
City
;
a
new
boiler
to
replace
that
which
exploded
in
the
Sutton
flouring
mill
,
being
the
first
freight
received
.

The
bank
of
J.
Dambauch
&
Son
was
in
existence
.

The
residence
for
the
pastor
of
the
German
Lutheran
church
,
the
Henry
Young
store
and
other
houses
were
completed
,
and
the
new
railroad
town
showed
increased
signs
of
business
activity
.

A
council
appears
to
have
had
control
of
the
place
at
that
time
,
as
mention
is
made
of
street
improvements
and
of
the
appointment
of
Z.
T.
Weise
as
chief
of
police
.

The
burning
question
at
the
time
was
the
location
of
the
railroad
depot
.

Once
the
location
for
the
depot
was
chosen
,
it
became
a
rather
famous
decision
,
creating
the
nations
only
railway
depot
that
was
built
over
water
.

Spanning
the
Breakneck
Creek
on
iron
beams
for
support
,
the
picturesque
railway
station
was
an
iconic
landmark
of
breathtaking
architecture
.

Due
to
its
age
and
growing
structural
instability
,
and
against
much
popular
protest
,
the
station
was
finally
demolished
in
the
early
0000s
rather
than
restored
.

Later
the
school
question
occupied
the
attention
of
the
people
.

Ultimately
the
schools
were
placed
under
the
control
of
the
Jackson
Township
board
after
a
resolution
by
the
Evans
City
school
building
committee
was
withdrawn
.

In
0000
Evans
City
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

At
the
charter
election
held
September
00
,
of
that
year
,
Edward
DAMBACH
was
chosen
burgess
.

The
first
churches
of
record
in
the
area
were
as
follows
:
Amana
Baptist
Church
was
organized
March
00
,
0000
.

Late
in
0000
some
00
members
withdrew
to
form
an
independent
Baptist
church
.

The
United
Presbyterian
Church
was
founded
about
the
year
0000
.

Services
were
held
in
the
frame
school-building
in
the
old
United
Presbyterian
cemetery
,
until
about
the
year
0000
,
when
a
brick
house
of
worship
was
erected
.

Owing
to
the
age
of
the
old
building
and
its
unsafe
condition
,
a

and
Indian
War
.

Harmony
was
founded
by
the
pietist
Johann
Georg
Rapp
and
his
Harmony
Society
in
0000
.

George
Rapp
came
to
America
from
Württemberg
,
Germany
in
0000
in
search
of
land
for
his
followers
that
was
free
from
religious
persecution
they
faced
in
Germany
.

He
was
searching
for
a
place
for
his
followers
to
worship
,
farm
and
put
into
effect
Rapp
's
communal
religious
teachings
.

In
0000
,
two
groups
of
Harmonites
purchased
a
tract
of
land
in
Butler
County
,
Pennsylvania
.

They
formally
established
the
Harmony
Society
in
0000
and
lived
in
Pennsylvania
for
about
00
years
before
selling
the
Harmony
property
in
0000
to
Abraham
Ziegler
,
a
Mennonite
,
and
moving
west
to
Indiana
Territory
,
where
they
built
the
town
of
Harmony
on
the
Wabash
River
(
now
New
Harmony
,
Indiana
)
.

In
0000
,
they
moved
back
to
Pennsylvania
,
this
time
to
Economy
(
now
Ambridge
)
.

The
settlements
were
economically
successful
,
producing
many
goods
in
a
clothing
factory
,
a
sawmill
,
a
tannery
,
and
from
their
vineyards
and
distillery
.

A
hotel
was
also
run
in
Harmony
.

In
Economy
,
the
group
aided
the
construction
of
the
Pittsburgh
and
Lake
Erie
Railroad
,
established
the
Economy
Savings
Institution
and
the
Economy
Brick
Works
,
and
operated
the
Economy
Oil
Company
,
Economy
Planing
Mill
,
Economy
Lumber
Company
,
and
eventually
donated
some
land
in
Beaver
Falls
for
the
construction
of
Geneva
College
.

In
0000
,
Mennonite
craftsmen
built
the
stone
wall
around
the
Harmonite
cemetery
in
Harmony
with
the
unique
revolving
stone
door
.

The
society
exerted
a
major
influence
on
the
economic
development
of
Western
Pennsylvania
.

But
since
the
group
chose
to
adopt
celibacy
,
they
eventually
died
out
when
John
S.
and
his
wife
Susanna
C.
Duss
,
the
last
surviving
leaders
of
Harmony
Society
,
died
in
0000
.

The
Mennonite
community
in
Harmony
lasted
until
around
0000
,
by
which
time
the
town
was
selling
more
and
more
individual
plots
.

Still
extant
is
an
old
Mennonite
meeting
house
on
a
hill
near
Harmony
that
was
built
in
0000
.

Harmony
's
history
,
particularly
that
of
the
Harmony
Society
,
is
preserved
at
The
Harmony
Museum
[

]
,
operated
in
the
town
by
Historic
Harmony
,
Inc.
.

On
a
hill
in
Harmony
,
situated
above
Connoquenessing
Creek
sits
a
"
seat
"
of
stone
(
actually
a
rock
formation
)
.

This
seat
was
used
by
Rapp
to
watch
over
the
commune
and
its
members
in
their
daily
lives
.

Thanks
to
local
Boy
Scout
Troop
000
(
Zelienople
,
PA
)
,
a
set
of
steps
were
built
leading
up
to
the
seat
as
part
of
an
Eagle
Scout
project
for
Christopher
Van
Arsdale
of
Harmony
.

Popular
culture
Harmony
is
the
setting
for
the
film
My
Bloody
Valentine
0D
,
however
the
movie
was
actually
filmed
farther
east
in
the
boroughs
of
Ford
City
and
Kittanning
.

History
Founded
in
0000
by
John
A.
Roebling
,
who
is
known
for
the
design
of
the
Brooklyn
Bridge
in
New
York
,
and
for
innovation
in
producing
wire
rope
,
the
community
was
initially
called
"
Germania
"
,
which
was
soon
changed
to
"
Sachsenburg
"
and
eventually
anglicized
to
Saxonburg
.

Roebling
had
set
out
with
his
brother
Karl
and
a
group
of
pioneers
from
Germany
in
0000
to
flee
the
general
unrest
and
oppression
in
Europe
.

The
two
men
,
along
with
a
handful
of
the
people
who
accompanied
them
on
the
trans-Atlantic
journey
secured
0000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
of
land
on
October
00
,
0000
from
Mrs.
Sarah
Collins
.

In
November
0000
KDKA
radio
,
regarded
as
the
world
's
first
commercial
radio
station
,
began
broadcasting
from
East
Pittsburgh
,
PA
,
but
later
located
its
transmitter
in
neighboring
Clinton
Township
.

The
Roebling
Museum
in
the
borough
maintains
several
artifacts
.

Nuclear
Lab
In
0000
,
Fred
Seitz
,
then
head
of
the
physics
department
at
Carnegie
Tech
,
brought
Ed
Creutz
(
who
later
succeeded
Seitz
as
department
head
)
,
Jack
Fox
(
who
succeeded
Creutz
as
department
head
)
,
Roger
Sutton
(
who
succeeded
Creutz
as
director
of
the
Saxonburg
Nuclear
Research
Center
)
and
Bert
Corben
to
Carnegie
Tech
to
establish
an
important
nuclear
physics
research
program
.

Through
a
series
of
initiatives
by
June
0
,
0000
a
leading-edge
000
MeV
proton
synchrocyclotron
was
built
at
the
Nuclear
Research
Center
near
Saxonburg
in
southern
Butler
County
.

The
research
program
developed
at
Saxonburg
flourished
up
to
the
mid-0000s
when
the
then-obsolete
accelerator
was
dismantled
.

The
legacy
of
that
work
remains
,
in
the
form
of
vigorous
,
medium
and
high
energy
nuclear
and
particle
physics
research
programs
carried
on
by
Carnegie
Mellon
groups
at
various
national
and
international
accelerator
laboratories
.

II-VI
Corporation
now
occupies
the
old
Nuclear
Research
Center
site
in
Saxonburg
.

As
of
0000
,
the
original
laboratory
building
remains
,
more
or
less
intact
,
as
does
the
old
dormitory/cafeteria/lounge
building
,
which
is
now
used
for
storage
.

The
most
obvious
changes
are
that
the
accelerator
and
attendant
shielding
are
gone
,
along
with
the
farmhouse
and
quonset
huts
;
the
high-bay
area
has
been
converted
to
three
levels
of
office
and
laboratory
space
;
and
there
has
been
considerable
new
construction
,
so
that
the
original
lab
building
is
now
but
a
fraction
of
the
total
facility
.

On
the
afternoon
of
0000-00-00
,

He
was

a
borough

County
,

0000
census

has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
00
%
is
land
and
0.00

is

.

Zelienople
is
situated
on
the

Creek
,
in
an
area
that
is
rich
with
coal
and
iron
ore
.

The
elevation
is
above
sea
level
.

History
Zelienople
was
named
for
the
eldest
daughter
of
Baron
Dettmar
Basse
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
whose
given
name
was
Zelie
.

Baron
Basse
arrived
in
0000
from
Frankfurt
am
Main
,
Germany
,
and
purchased
a
tract
of
of
land
in
Butler
and
Beaver
counties
.

He
proceeded
to
lay
out
a
village
,
and
build
his
own
private
residence
,
a
three
story
castle
,
complete
with
towers
,
turrets
and
battlements
,
named
"
The
Bassenheim
"
,
which
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
0000
.

At
the
time
,
Zelie
was
betrothed
to
Philip
Louis
Passavant
,
and
was
still
in
Germany
.

Extensive
preparations
were
made
by
Baron
Basse
,
to
establish
the
new
home
and
town
in
America
and
prepare
it
for
his
daughter
's
arrival
in
September
0000
.

Baron
Basse
sold
of
his
land
to
George
Rapp
,
a
Bavarian
pietist
religious
leader
,
who
founded
the
village
of
Harmony
.

Baron
Basse
came
to
be
known
as
"
Dr.
Muller
"
.

Whether
the
title
of
"
Doctor
"
was
given
to
him
due
a
knowledge
of
medicine
,
or
conferred
upon
him
as
a
degree
,
is
unknown
.

He
was
regarded
as
an
intelligent
man
,
and
during
the
Napoleon
ic
era
represented
Frankfurt
as
an
ambassador
to
Paris
.

Basse
returned
to
Germany
in
0000
,
leaving
his
business
to
his
son-in-law
,
Philipp
Passavant
.

Philip
Passavant
opened
the
first
store
in
0000
,
and
managed
it
for
00
years
,
until
he
gave
it
to
his
son
,
C.
S.
Passavant
.

By
0000
,
there
were
fifty
houses
in
Zelienople
,
and
three
churches
.

The
population
in
0000
was
000
,
and
in
0000
,
it
had
grown
to
000
.

In
0000
,
the
first
passenger
train
arrived
to
the
town
,
substantially
increasing
the
growth
and
commerce
.

In
0000
,
the
American
Union
Telegraph
Company
established
an
office
in
Zelienople
.

The
Federalists
appointed
Andrew
McClure
,
a
local
tavern-keeper
,
as
the
first
postmaster
of
Zelienople
in
the
first
decade
of
0000
.

Christian
Buhl
was
named
the
first
justice
of
the
peace
in
0000
.

Early
Zelienople
commerce
supported
the
local
agriculture
community
,
as
there
was
no
viable
means
of
transportation
.

In
0000
Zelienople
was
incorporated
as
a
Borough
.

In
0000
a
railroad
was
built
through
Zelienople
.

From
this
time
there
has
been
moderate
expansion
of
industry
,
residences
,
and
local
government
.

There
has
been
a
Volunteer
Fire
Department
since
about
0000
.

A
full-time
Borough
Manager
was
hired
in
0000
.

The
growth
of
Pittsburgh
to
the
south
along
with
the
building
of
Interstate
00
,
provides
a
challenge
to
Zelienople
in
coping
with
these
changes
through
the
00st
century
.

Era
One

was
the

Hotel
.

sold
to
the

Springs
Co.

It
was
hoped
to
attract
visitors
from
Pittsburgh
and
Johnstown
looking
for
clean
air
and
"
therapeutic
"
mineral
springs
.

Although
itself
unsuccessful
,
it
led
to
the
development
of
several
other
hotels
,
companies
,
and
the
town
itself
.

The
area
is
currently
known
as
the
"
Mountainhouse
Grounds
"
to
local
residents

some
in

condition
)
including
those
of
Andrew
Carnegie
and
Benjamin
Jones
.

Johnstown
is
a
city
in
Cambria
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
west-southwest
of
Altoona
,
Pennsylvania
and
east
of
Pittsburgh
.

The
population
was
00,000
at

census
.

It
is
the
principal
city
of
the
Johnstown
,
Pennsylvania
,
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
,
which
includes
Cambria
County
.

History
Johnstown
,
settled
in
0000
,
is
perhaps
most
famous
for
its
eight
major
flood
s.
The
"
Great
Flood
"
of
May
00
,
0000
occurred
after
the
South
Fork
Dam
collapsed
upstream
from
the
city
during
heavy
rain
s.
At
least
0,000
people
died
as
a
result
of
the
flood
and
subsequent
fire
that
raged
through
the
debris
.

Other
major
floods
occurred
in
0000
and
0000
.

Despite
a
pledge
by
President
Franklin
Delano
Roosevelt
to
make
the
city
flood
free
,
and
subsequent
work
to
do
so
,
another
major
flood
occurred
in
0000
.

The
0000
flood
-
in
what
was
to
have
been
a
"
flood
free
"
city
-
may
have
contributed
to
Johnstown
's
subsequent
population
decline
and
inability
to
attract
new
residents
and
businesses
.

The

is
home

0000
-

Johnstown
was
formally
organized
as
a
town
in
0000
by
the
Swiss
German
immigrant
Joseph
Johns
(
born
Josef
Schantz
)
.

The
settlement
was
initially
known
as
Schantzstadt
,
but
was
soon
anglicized
to
Johnstown
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
the
city
was
a
port
and
key
transfer
point
along
the
Pennsylvania
Main
Line
Canal
.

Johnstown
was
at
the
head
of
the
canal
's
western
branch
,
with
canal
boats
having
been
transported
over
the
mountains
via
the
Allegheny
Portage
Railroad
and
refloated
here
,
to
continue
the
trip
by
water
to
Pittsburgh
and
the
Ohio
Valley
.

Perhaps
the
most
famous
passenger
who
traveled
via
the
canal
to
visit
Johnstown
briefly
was
Charles
Dickens
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
canal
transport
became
redundant
with
the
completion
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
which
now
spanned
the
state
.

With
the
coming
of
the
railroads
,
the
city
’s
growth
improved
.

Johnstown
became
a
stop
on
the
main
line
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
and
was
connected
with
the
Baltimore
&
Ohio
.

The
railroads
provided
large-scale
development
of
the
region
’s
mineral
wealth
.

Iron
,
coal
,
and
steel
quickly
became
central
to
the
town
of
Johnstown
.

By
0000
,
the
Cambria
Iron
Company
of
Johnstown
was
the
leading
steel
producer
in
the
United
States
,
outproducing
steel
giants
Pittsburgh
and
Cleveland
.

Through
the
second
half
of
the
00th
century
,
Johnstown
made
much
of
the
nation
's
barbed
wire
.

Johnstown
prospered
from
skyrocketing
demand
in
the
western
United
States
for
barbed
wire
.

Twenty
years
after
its
founding
,
the
Cambria
Works
was
a
huge
enterprise
sprawling
over
in
Johnstown
and
employing
0,000
.

It
owned
of
valuable
mineral
lands
in
a
region
with
a
ready
supply
of
iron
,
coal
and
limestone
.

Floods
were
almost
a
yearly
event
in
the
valley
during
the
0000s
.

On
the
afternoon
of
May
00
,
0000
,
following
a
quiet
Memorial
Day
ceremony
and
a
parade
,
it
began
raining
in
the
valley
.

The
next
day
water
filled
the
streets
and
rumors
began
stating
that
a
dam
holding
an
artificial
lake
in
the
mountains
to
the
northeast
might
give
way
.

The
dam
gave
way
and
an
estimated
00
million
tons
of
water
began
spilling
into
the
winding
gorge
that
led
to
Johnstown
some
away
.

The
destruction
in
Johnstown
occurred
in
only
about
00
minutes
.

What
had
been
a
thriving
steel
town
with
homes
,
churches
,
saloons
,
a
library
,
a
railroad
station
,
electric
street
lights
,
a
roller-skating
rink
,
and
two
opera
houses
was
buried
under
mud
and
debris
.

At
least
0,000
people
are
known
to
have
perished
in
the
disaster
.

An
infamous
site
of
a
major
fire
during
the
flood
was
the
old
stone
Pennsylvania
Railroad
bridge
located
where
the
Stonycreek
and
Little
Conemaugh
Rivers
form
the
Conemaugh
River
.

The
bridge
still
stands
today
.

The
Johnstown
Flood
established
the
American
Red
Cross
as
the
pre-eminent
emergency
relief
organization
in
the
United
States
.

Founder
Clara
Barton
,
then
00
,
came
to
Johnstown
with
00
doctors
and
nurses
and
set
up
tent
hospitals
as
well
as
temporary
"
hotels
"
for
the
homeless
,
and
stayed
on
for
five
months
to
coordinate
relief
efforts
.

The
mills
were
back
in
operation
within
a
month
.

The
Cambria
Works
grew
,
and
Johnstown
became
more
prosperous
than
ever
.

The
disaster
had
not
destroyed
the
community
but
strengthened
it
.

Later
generations
would
draw
on
lessons
learned
in
0000
.

00th
century
Johnstown
was
a
remarkably
prosperous
hard-working
city
during
the
inter-war
years
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
the
population
reached
00,000
people
.

Its
public
transportation
was
considered
one
of
the
best
of
any
small
city
in
the
United
States
.

The
city
's
first
commercial
radio
station
,
WJAC
,
began
broadcasts
in
0000
.

The
downtown
boasted
at
least
five
major
department
stores
,
including
Glosser
Brothers
,
which
in
the
0000s
gave
birth
to
the
Gee
Bee
chain
of
department
stores
.

However
,
the
St
Patrick
's
Day
0000
Flood
combined
with
the
gnawing
effects
of
the
Great
Depression
left
Johnstown
struggling
again
,
but
only
temporarily
.

Johnstown
’s
citizens
mobilized
to
achieve
a
permanent
solution
to
the
flooding
problem
and
wrote
to
President
Franklin
Roosevelt
pleading
for
Federal
aid
.

Starting
in
August
0000
,
continuing
for
the
next
five
years
,
the
U.
S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
gouged
widened
,
deepened
,
and
realigned
of
channel
in
the
city
,
and
encased
the
river
banks
in
concrete
and
reinforced
steel
.

In
a
campaign
organized
by
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
thousands
of
Johnstown
’s
citizens
wrote
to
friends
and
relatives
across
the
country
hoping
to
bring
new
business
to
the
town
.

Professional
hockey
would
find
a
home
in
Johnstown
,
starting
in
0000
with
the
Johnstown
Blue
Birds
for
one
season
and
returning
in
0000
with
the
Johnstown
Jets
.

The
Jets
later
hosted
an
exhibition
game
against
Maurice
Richard
and
the
Montreal
Canadiens
on
November
00
,
0000
.

The
memory
of
floods
was
virtually
purged
from
the
community
’s
consciousness
.

Newcomers
to
the
town
heard
little
about
the
tragic
past
.

Johnstown
proclaimed
itself
"
flood-free
,
"
a
feeling
reinforced
when
Johnstown
was
virtually
the
only
riverside
city
in
Pennsylvania
not
to
flood
during
Hurricane
Agnes
in
0000
.

The
immediate
post-WWII
years
mark
Johnstown
's
peak
as
a
steel
maker
and
fabricator
.

At
its
peak
,
steel
provided
Johnstowners
with
more
than
00,000
full-time
,
well-paying
jobs
.

However
,
increased
domestic
and
foreign
competition
,
coupled
with
Johnstown
's
relative
distance
from
its
primary
iron
ore
source
in
the
western
Great
Lakes
,
led
to
a
steady
decline
in
profitability
.

New
capital
investment
waned
.

Johnstown
's
mountainous
terrain
,
and
the
resulting
poor
layout
for
the
mills
'
physical
plant
strung
along
of
river
bottom
lands
,
compounded
the
problem
.

New
regulations
ordered
by
the
EPA
in
the
0000s
also
hit
Johnstown
with
its
aging
plant
especially
hard
.

A
community
with
a
lesser
tradition
might
have
reacted
with
despair
.

Instead
,
with
encouragement
from
the
steel
company
,
the
city
fathers
organized
an
association
called
Johnstown
Area
Regional
Industries
(
JARI
)
and
,
within
a
year
,
raised
$
0
million
for
industrial
development
in
the
area
.

Bethlehem
Steel
,
which
was
the
major
contributor
to
the
fund
,
committed
itself
to
bringing
new
steelmaking
technologies
to
Johnstown
because
they
were
impressed
by
the
city
’s
own
efforts
to
diversify
.

Extensive
damage
from
the
0000
flood
was
heavy
and
there
was
talk
of
the
company
pulling
out
.

Again
,
the
city
won
a
reprieve
from
the
company
’s
top
management
,
which
had
always
regarded
the
Johnstown
works
with
special
affection
because
of
its
history
and
reputation
.

As
the
increasing
amount
of
federal
environmental
regulations
became
more
difficult
to
comply
with
and
the
issues
with
the
aging
manufacturing
facilities
,
in
0000
,
steel
companies
began
closing
down
plants
all
over
the
country
,
it
looked
as
if
Johnstown
had
exhausted
its
appeals
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
Johnstown
abandoned
most
of
its
steel
production
,
although
some
limited
fabrication
work
continues
.

0000s
In
0000
,
U.S.
Census
data
showed
that
Johnstown
was
the
least
likely
city
in
the
United
States
to
attract
newcomers
;
however
,
what
were
previously
relatively
weak
opportunities
provided
by
the
local
manufacturing
and
service
economies
have
more
recently
begun
to
burgeon
,
attracting
outsiders
.

Gamesa
Corporación
Tecnológica
,
a
Spanish
wind
energy
company
,
opened
its
first
U.S.
wind
turbine
blade
manufacturing
facility
near
here
in
0000
.

Several
state-of-the-art
operational
wind
turbines
are
sited
on
Babcock
Ridge
,
the
"
eastern
continental
divide
,
"
along
the
eastern
edge
of
Cambria
and
Somerset
Counties
.

Lockheed
Martin
relocated
a
facility
from
Greenville
,
SC
to
Johnstown
in
0000
.

Companies
like
Concurrent
Technologies
Corporation
,
DRS
Laurel
Technologies
,
ITSI
Biosciences
,
Kongsberg
Defense
and
more
throughout
the
region
are
embracing
cutting
edge
technology
and
scientific
progress
to
create
products
that
make
life
easier
,
better
and
greener
.

Recent
construction
in
the
surrounding
region
,
the
downtown
,
and
adjacent
Kernville
neighborhood
—
including
a
new
Regional
Technology
Complex
that
will
house
a
division
of
Northrop
Grumman
,
among
other
tenants
—
signal
the
increasing
dependence
of
Johnstown
's
economy
on
the
U.S.
government
's
defense
budget
.

The
high-tech
defense
industry
is
now
the
main
non-health-care
staple
of
the
Johnstown
economy
,
with
the
region
pulling
in
well
over
$
000M
annually
in
Federal
government
contracts
,
punctuated
by
one
of
the
premier
defense
trade
shows
in
the
U.S.
,
the
annual
Showcase
For
Commerce
.

Johnstown
remains
a
regional
medical
,
education
al
,
cultural
,
and
communications
center
.

As
in
many
other
locales
,
health
care
provides
a
significant
percentage
of
the
employment
opportunities
in
the
city
.

The
region
is
located
right
in
the
middle
of
the
“
Health
Belt
”
,
an
area
stretching
from
the
Midwest
to
New
England
and
down
the
East
Coast
that
has
had
massive
growth
in
the
health
care
industry
.

Incredible

Johnstown
in
the
arts
and
literature
"
The
River
"
(
Bruce
Springsteen
song
)
mentions
the
Johnstown
Company
-
"
I
got
a
job
working
construction
,
for
the
Johnstown
Company
,
but
lately
there
ai
n't
been
no
work
on
account
of
the
economy
.
"

Highway
Patrolman
,
another
Springsteen
song
,
has
lyrics
"
as
the
band
played
'
Night
of
the
Johnstown
Flood
.
'
"

Two
major
motion
pictures
have
been
filmed
in
Johnstown
,
taking
advantage
of
the
city
's
atmosphere
.

The
first
is
0000
's
Slap
Shot
,
directed
by
George
Roy
Hill
and
featuring
Paul
Newman
as
an
aging
hockey
player/coach
.

The
screenplay
by
Nancy
Dowd
was
a
parody
loosely
based
on
the
real-life
Johnstown
Jets
hockey
team
and
its
North
American
Hockey
League
championship
in
0000
.

In
the
movie
,
Johnstown
was
rechristened
"
Charlestown
"
and
the
Jets
as
the
Charlestown
Chiefs
.

The
film
's
premiere
engendered
some
local
controversy
,
as
some
thought
Johnstown
was
portrayed
in
a
less
than
flattering
light
.

The
name
"
Charlestown
"
itself
is
believed
to
be
a
reference
to
Charles
Kunkle
,
an
influential
local
businessman
of
the
era
.

Slap
Shot
has
since
become
the
iconic
movie
about
hockey
and
its
foibles
.

Nancy
Dowd
would
revive
the
fake
town
of
"
Charlestown
"
in
her
screenplay
for
the
0000
punk
rock
satire
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
,
The
Fabulous
Stains
,
but
the
film
itself
was
shot
in
Canada
.

The
second
major
film
was
All
the
Right
Moves
,
a
high
school
football
drama
set
in
the
fictional
town
of
Ampipe
and
featuring
Tom
Cruise
,
Lea
Thompson
and
Craig
T.
Nelson
.

Locations
seen
in
the
movie
are
the
old
Johnstown
High
School
in
Kernville
,
torn
down
shortly
afterwards
;

Stadium
;
the
Johnstown
"
Cochran
"
Junior
High
football
practice
field
and
the
Johnstown
Vo-Tech
football
locker
room
.

Part
of
the
film
Rock
Star
takes
place
in
Pittsburgh
and
several
scenes
,
including
the
opening
scene
,
were
filmed
in
Johnstown
.

Historian
David
McCullough
wrote
what
is
widely
regarded
as
the
city
's
definitive
history
,
The
Johnstown
Flood
,
in
0000
.

McCullough
completed
his
research
with
the
aid
of
the
remaining
flood
survivors
.

Author
C.
Coco
de
Young
used
her
own
family
history
to
write
about
first-generation
immigrants
living
in
Johnstown
during
the
Great
Depression
in
her
first
novel
,
A
Letter
to
Mrs.
Roosevelt
(
0000
)
.

The
film
"
The
Johnstown
Flood
"
,
written
and
directed
by
Charles
Guggenheim
,
won
the
Academy
Award
for
Best
Documentary
,
Short
Subject
in
0000
.

The
film
was
commissioned
by
the
Johnstown
Flood
Museum
Association
,
which
later
reorganized
as
the
Johnstown
Area
Heritage
Association
,
and
is
shown
every

Mystery
novel
writer
K.C.
Constantine
fictionalized
many
elements
of
Johnstown
and
its
culture
as
"
Rocksburg
"
in
his
novels
,
although
the
nearby
city
of
Greensburg
,
Pennsylvania
also
provides
some
of
the
lore
for
Rocksburg
.

In
0000
,
Kathleen
Cambor
published
In
Sunlight
,
In
A
Beautiful
Garden
.

The
novel
followed
its
characters
through
the
events
leading
up
to
and
including
the
0000
flood
.

Although
the
protagonists
in
the
novel
were
fictional
,
several
historical
figures
,
such
as
Andrew
Mellon
,
Henry
Clay
Frick
and
Daniel
Morrell
were
also
depicted
in
the
book
.

Author
James
Patterson
had
his
fictional
serial
kidnapper
,
Gary
Soneji
,
from
Along
Came
A
Spider
stopping
at
a
convenience
store
on
his
way
through
Johnstown
,
Pennsylvania
.

Author
David
Morrell
had
his
fictional
character
"
Eliot
"
recruit
two
brothers
from
an
orphanage
in
Johnstown
to
train
as
assassins
in
Brotherhood
of
the
Rose
.

In
0000
's
haunting
film
Dawn
of
the
Dead
,
a
character
mentions
that
they
are
flying
over
Johnstown
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
quips
that
the
people
are
actually
entertained
by
the
zombie
outbreak
.

George
A.
Romero
filmed
the
majority
of
the
zombie
movie
at
the
Monroeville
Mall
,
some
00-odd
miles
away
.

In
0000
,
singer-songwriter
Will
Hawkins
released
a
song
entitled
"
Johnstown
"
on
his
album
Ghost
Town
.

The
song
's
protagonist
was
a
reservist
returning
home
from
the
Iraq
War
and
coming
to
terms
with
a
life
without
a
limb
.

The
song
was
inspired
by
actual
reservists
from
Johnstown
whom
Hawkins
met
during
a
USO
sponsored
performance
at
Walter
Reed
Army
Hospital
in
Washington
D.C.
.

In
addition
to
international
radio
play
,
the
song
was
also
featured
prominently
in
John
Murtha
's
0000
re-election
campaign
for
the
seat
he
held
in
the
House
of
Representatives
for
almost
00
years
.

Hawkins
toured
extensively
raising
funds
and
awareness
for
the
Intrepid
Fallen
Heros
Fund
that
donated
directly
to
injured
soldiers
who
were
left
without
health

History
What
is
now
Nanty
Glo
Borough
originated
in
the
0000s
and
was
called
Glenglade
.

By
0000
,
the
community
was
a
lumber
camp
of
00
houses
built
on
both
sides
of
the
southern
branch
of
Blacklick
Creek
,
which
forms
the
border
of
Blacklick
Township
on
the
north
side
and
Jackson
Township
on
the
south
side
.

A
post
office
opened
for
Glenglade
on
November
00
,
0000
,
with
Merton
A
Davis
as
the
first
postmaster
.

Three
Davis
brothers
took
turns
as
postmaster
:
Merton
A.
,
from
0000
until
0000
;
Montell
,
0000
until
0000
,
and
Everett
C.
,
0000-0000
.

According
to
oral
history
,
the
town
name
was
changed
to
Nant-y-glo
during
the
term
of
Montell
Davis
,
through
the
intervention
of
his
wife
.

Glenglade
became
Nant-y-glo
on
February
00
,
0000
.

Whether
the
Davises
had
the
small
town
of
the
same
name
in
Wales
in
mind
or
just
thought
the
melodic-sounding
Welsh
phrase
fit
the
town
is
not
known
.

The
name
of
Blacklick
for
the
creek
that
bisects
the
town
and
the
adjacent
township
probably
means
much
the
same
as
"
brook
of
coal
,
"
a
lick
being
a
common
synonym
for
brook
and
the
"
black
"
referring
to
outcroppings
of
coal
seams
on
the
stream
banks
and
bed
.

By
0000
the
huge
coal
deposits
in
the
settlement
had
attracted
additional
settlers
and
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
installed
a
spur
line
through
the
community
that
year
.

Commercial
mining
was
initiated
in
0000
by
Dr.
James
W.
Dunwiddie
of
Pine
Flats
,
Indiana
County
,
who
opened
up
what
was
then
called
Nanty
Glo
No.
0
.

Heisley
Mine
(
0000
)
was
by
far
the
largest
,
most
profitable
,
and
longest-lived
Nanty
Glo
mine
.

It
was
originally
owned
and
operated
by
Coleman-Weaver
Company
as
Heisley
Mine
No.
0
until
0000
,
when
Coleman-Weaver
dissolved
and
partner
John
Heisley
Weaver
,
a
Philadelphia
industrialist
,
acquired
sole
ownership
.

Colman-Weaver
Company
also
originally
owned
the
mines
in
Revloc
and
Colver
and
launched
the
Cambria
and
Indiana
Railroad
(
C&I
)
,
which
served
most
Cambria
County
mines
through
most
of
the
00th
century
.

Weaver
also
owned
the
mines
in
Heilwood
,
Indiana
County
,
which
was
renamed
from
Possum
Glory
to
Heilwood
after
Weaver
's
nickname
,
"
Heil
,
"
from
Heisley
.

Weaver
died
in
0000
and
his
company
sold
Heisley
to
Bethlehem
Mines
in
0000
.

Bethlehem
renamed
the
mine
Monroe
Mine
No.
000
and
later
renamed
it
Bethelehem
Mine
00
and
moved
its
main
entrance
from
Nanty
Glo
to
Jackson
Township
(
Leidy
Portal
)
.

The
mine
closed
in
the
0000s
.

Other
mines
in
what
is
now
Nanty
Glo
and
their
starting
dates
included
Lincoln
(

;

Early
History
Summerhill
,
a
small
borough
in
the
Allegheny
Mountains
in
southwestern
Pennsylvania
,
was
settled
in
the
early
0000s
and
grew
in
large
part
from
the
Allegheny
Portage
Railroad
and
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

The
Thomas
and
Barbara
Croyle
family
is
one
of
the
earliest
recorded
families
to
settle
in
the
town
in
0000
.

Their
family
homestead
,
a
two-story
stone
structure
that
still
stands
,
has
storied
history
in
that
it
served
the
family
as
a
fortress
against
Indian
attacks
.

According
to
some
sources
,
Indians
burned
the
Croyle
’s
cabin
and
property
,
causing
the
family
to
seek
refuge
at
Fort
Bedford
.

By
0000
,
Barbara
Croyle
chose
to
rebuild
their
homestead
with
stone
and
limited
windows
to
two
sides
of
the
house
to
keep
it
stronger
if
attacked
.

The
Croyle
family
built
a
grist
mill
,
known
locally
as
Croyle
's
Mill
,
and
a
dam
on
the
Little
Conemaugh
River
to
operate
it
.

The
establishment
of
the
mill
was
significant
enough
for
the
county
to
notice
and
fund
its
first
public
works
project
,
a
dirt
road
from
Ebensburg
to
Croyle
's
Mill
.

The
mill
operated
into
the
0000s
.

In
February
0000
,
Summerhill
Township
was
devolved
from
larger
Conemaugh
Township
,
one
of
three
original
townships
established
in
Cambria
County
.

Originally
spelled
“
Somerhill
,
”
the
township
was
likely
named
for
Joseph
and
David
Somers
,
some
of
its
early
,
chief
landowners
.

In
the
0000s
,
Summerhill
Township
covered
a
large
swath
of
land
in
the
north-central
part
of
the
current
county
,
including
present-day
Jackson
,
Munster
,
Washington
,
Portage
and
Blacklick
Townships
.

The
existing
borough
took
its
name
from
Summerhill
Township
and
was
then
known
as
Summer
Hill
.

Records
from

the
borough
’s
current
spelling

.

Westmont
is
a
borough
in
Cambria
County
,
Pennsylvania

United

.

It
is
part
of
the
Johnstown
,
Pennsylvania
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at

Geography
Westmont
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
,
about
00
miles
WSW
of
Altoona
,
Pennsylvania
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

History
Before
the
Johnstown
Flood
of
0000
,
Yoder
Hill
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
a
few
farms
,
accessible
by
only
a
few
steep
,
muddy
roads
.

However
,
since
the
Flood
was
so
devastating
to
the
city
and
to
its
major
employer
,
the
Cambria
Iron
Company
,
the
iron
company
decided
to
develop
the
top
of
the
hill
as
a
suburb
for
its
top
personnel
to
live
in
.

The
company
commissioned
the
famous
landscape
architect
,
Charles
Miller
,
to
lay
out
the
grid
for
the
settlement
of
"
Tiptop
"
,
later
renamed
Westmont
.

Westmont
was
located
on
a
ridge
above
the
valley
in
which
Johnstown
is
located
,
and
thus
in
a
place
of
safety
.

As
such
,
it
was
also
above
the
smoke
,
noise
,
and
stench
of
the
city
,
and
attracted
the
well-to-do
of
the
town
,
eager
to
escape
what
(
in
many
cases
)
their
own
factories
had
wrought
.

An
inclined
railway
,
the
Johnstown
Inclined
Plane
was
built
for
easy
travel
to
the
city
.

With
the
problem
of
transportation
solved
,
the
new
settlement
began
to
grow
,
and
it
was
incorporated
as
the
Borough
of
Westmont
on
June
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
Borough
bought
the
inclined
railway
from
Bethlehem
Steel
.

In
0000
Johnstown
Traction
Company
began
to
operate
bus
service
to
Westmont
Borough
via
buses
that
rode
up
and
down
the
Inclined
Plane
.

At
one
time
there
were
plans
to
extend
the
Southmont
streetcar
line
from
its
terminus
at
Diamond
Boulevard
and
Menoher
Boulevard
along
Diamond
Boulevard
to
Luzerne
Street
,
and
then
along
Luzerne
Street
in
the
center
median
to
Colgate
Avenue
.

This
rail
service
extension
was
never
constructed
and
streetcar
service
on
the
Southmont
line
was
discontinued
in
0000
when
a
rock
slide
along
Southmont
Boulevard
damaged
the
track
and
overhead
.

Following
completion
of
the
"
Easy
Grade
"
highway
of
Menoher
Boulevard
(
PA
Route
000
)
from
downtown
Johnstown
through
to
Westmont
,
bus
service
was
transferred
to
this
route
and
service
via
the
Inclined
Plane
was
discontinued
.

Because
of
its
upland
location
,
Westmont
escaped
destruction
in
the
subsequent
floods
that
damaged
flood-prone
Johnstown
.

The
Westmont
Historic
District
was
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Westmont
Today
Westmont
continues
to
be
a
town
of
significant
attractive
,
large
,
old
houses
.

The
present
population
of
Westmont
is
approximately
0,000
residents
.

Westmont
is
currently
governed
by
the
“
Weak
Mayor-Council
”
form
of
government
.

There
are
seven
council
members
and
a
mayor
who
are
elected
by
the
voters
for
four-year
staggered
terms
.

The
mayor
votes
only
in
case
of
a
tie
.

The
Borough
Council
determines
municipal
policy
,
enacts
laws
,
approves
borough
officials
,
etc.
.

Daily
operations
are
supervised
by
the
Borough
Secretary
and
the
Public
Works
Director
.

Westmont
has
a
volunteer
Fire
Company
and
an
ambulance
service
.

Police
protection
is
provided
by
the
West
Hills
Regional
Police
Department
.

Today
Westmont
Borough
,
even
though
considerably
larger
than
that
envisioned
by
the
Cambria
Iron
Company
officials
,
still
retains
many
of
the
characteristics
which
attracted
residents
here
in
the
first
place
.

It
is
,
for
the
most
part
,
still
a
quiet
.

One
can
see
joggers
,
walkers
and
children
throughout
the
community
at
all
times
of
the
day
.

Borough
restrictions
against
commercial
enterprise
are
still
enforced
.

Perhaps
the
town
's
standout
feature
is
the
allee
of
American
Elm
trees
along
Luzerne
Street
,
the
last
cathedral-arched
boulevard
left
in
the
United
States
.

Today
there
are
000
elms
,
the
longest
continuous
stand
of
American
Elms
in
the
country
,
planted
along
Luzerne
Street
.

Westmont
's
elm
trees
are
intensively
maintained
to
protect
them
from

Elm
Disease
.

History
In
the
book
Underground
Railroad
in
Pennsylvania
by
William
J.
Switala
.

Switala
makes
reference
to
Wilmore
,
Pennsylvania
being
a
part
of
this
anti
slavery
movement
.

-
Johnstown
-
Wilmore-Ebensburg-Burnside
Route
.
"

From
Johnstown
,
the
fugitive
slaves
moved
northeasterly
through
the
heavily
wooded
valleys
and
gullies
of
the
Appalacian
Mountains
.

The
more
well
known
of
the
two
routes
…
proceeds
from
Johnstown
all
the
way
to
Ebensburg
,
following
the
trace
that
eventually
became
I-000
.

Blockson
mentions
a
stop
along
the
route
at
the
hamlet
of
Wilmore
,
a
small
black
community
located
about
eight
miles
south
of
Ebensburg
and
near
Portage
.

Godfrey
Wilmore
,
a
former
slave
from
Maryland
,
is
reported
to
have
founded
the
community
.
"

Godfrey
Wilmore
was
born
0000
in
or
near
Cumberland
,
Allegheny
County
,
Maryland
[
0
]
and
died
April
0
,
0000
in
Wilmore
,
Pennsylvania
;
buried
St.
Michael
’s
Cemetery
,
Loretto
,
Pennsylvania
.

Godfrey
married
Mary
Higgins
,
who
was
born
0000
in
Ireland
and
died
Aug
00
,
0000
in
Wilmore
,
PA
;
buried
St.
Michael
’s
Cemetery
,
Loretto
,
Pennsylvania
.

Godfrey
was
a
freed
slave
of
African
descent
.

Mary
was
either
an
indentured
servant
or
a
redemptioner
and
was
of
Irish
descent
.

Both
his
and
Mary
Higgins
’
servitude
was
documented
within
Harford
County
,
Maryland
.

Godfrey
is
said
to
have
been
a
man
of
above
average
intellect
,
who
could
read
and
write
.

This
is
referenced
numerous
times
within
Cambria
County
,
Pennsylvania
documents
by
the
notation
that
Godfrey
Wilmore
wrote
the
document
and
witnessed
it
by
his
signature
,
whereas
the
other
parties
sign
by
their
mark
“
X
“
.

In
that
he
was
a
slave
,
the
fact
that
he
could
read
and
write
is
remarkable
and
suggests
that
he
may
have
been
a
“
house
slave
”
or
a
supervisory
slave
laborer
.

Even
more
remarkable
is
that
it
is
further
said
that
he
was
an
energetic
man
who
worked
enough
extra
,
outside
of
his
servitude
,
that
he
was
able
to
buy
his
freedom
.

Documents
go
on
to
say
that
he
then
bought
the
remaining
time
of
indentured
servitude
of
his
white
wife
Mary
Higgins
.

Further
it
is
also
noted
that
due
to
his
education
,
Godfrey
becomes
the
first
teacher
in
the
area
that
surrounds
Wilmore
Pennsylvania
.

According
to
the
"
Souvenir
of
St.
Michael
's
Parish
,
Loretto
,
Pa.
"
-
On
or
about
0000
(
?
)

,
this
family
traveled
from
Harford
Co.
,
Maryland
,
along
the
Conocacheague
Valley
(
pronounced
by
the
early
settlers
Con-eck
e-jig
)
,
west
word
through
Cumberland
,
Maryland
,
and
eventually
coming
to
settle
in
a
place
then
known
as
"
Jimmy
Rhey
Place
"
(
0000
-
John
Mangus
resides
)
.

This
Family
was
a
charter
pioneer
in
the
formation
of
Summerhill
Township
(
0000
)
and
very
likely
a
charter
pioneer
in
the
formation
of
Cambria
County
(
0000
)
.

The
family
moved
but
once
more
,
to
a
farm
approx
.

0
mile
south
of
the
town
of
Wilmore
(
0000
-
James
H.
White
Farm
)
.

Godfrey
built
the
first
sawmill
in
this
section
of
the
County
on
the
Little
Conemaugh
River
,
below
the
town
of
Wilmore
,
Pennsylvania
.

This
water
driven
saw
mill
was
subsequently
washed
away
and
rebuilt
about
000
yards
east
of
the
present
(
0000
)
Pennsylvania
Railroad
Depot
.

Mary
(
Higgins
)
Wilmore
was
a
Catholic
.

Godfrey
Wilmore
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
a
Baptist
and
well
acquainted
with
the
Sacred
Scriptures
.

Father
Demetrius
Augustine
Gallitzin
,
a
Catholic
priest
,
who
was
a
former
Russian
prince
,
visited
the
Wilmore
household
with
a
view
to
reconciling
the
differences
of
religion
within
the
family
and
it
was
said
that
they
had
many
earnest
,
controversial
conversations
,
which
eventually
resulted
in
Godfrey
's
conversion
to
Catholicism
.

In
0000
,
Sylvester
Welch
's
Corps
of
Engineers
was
running
the
lines
of
the
Allegheny
Portage
Railroad
through
Summerhill
Township
and
they
came
across
“
…
a
little
village
which
they
marked
on
their
map
"
Guinea
"
,
an
appellation
which
the
Irish
laborers
who
built
the
road
adopted
until
the
matter
was
made
a
subject
of
complaint
to
Fr
.

Gallitzin
,
who
from
the
altar
denounced
this
insult
to
a
family
for
whom
he
had
the
greatest
respect
.

It
was
said
that
he
Father
Gallitzin
would
chastise
any
person
who
would
call
the
town
by
that
opprobrious
name
and
he
declared
that
it
should
be
known
as
Jefferson
...
"
in
honor
of
our
third
President
.

This
is
further
referenced
within
the
will
of
Bernard
Wilmore
,
the
oldest
son
of
Godfrey
and
Mary
Wilmore
,
that
he
lists
the
town
of
Jefferson
as
his
home
.

It
was
Bernard
,
with
the
help
of
his
nephew
Martin
Wilmore
(
son
of
James
and
Catharine
Wilmore
)
who
laid
out
the
town-site
of
then
Guinea
,
changing
the
name
,
because
of
the
promptings
of
Father
Gallitzin
,
to
Jefferson
(
June
0
,
0000
)
.

On
June
00
,
0000
the
contract
was
let
for
Section
00
of
the
Old
Portage
Railroad
,
which
ran
through
Jefferson
.

By
the
time
of
its
completion
in
0000
.

Jefferson
,
as
the
name
of
the
town
,
never
caught
on
.

The
0th
Post
Office
in
the
County
,
established
in
Aug.
0000
along
with
the
train
depot
were
forever
referred
to
,
by
the
residents
,
as
Wilmore
's
Post
Office
and
Wilmore
's
Station
respectively
.

In
0000
the
town
was
formally
incorporated
into
a
Borough
under
the
name
of
Wilmore
and
there
were
00
homes
.

Mary
Wilmore
,
who
was
a
daughter
of
Godfrey
and
Mary
Wilmore
,
married
James
Young
.

He
was
educated
,
could
read
and
write
and
was
a
contractor
and
the
person
who
built
St.
Bartholomew
's
Church
-
the
present
day
Gothic
structure
in
Wilmore
which
replaced
the
small
stone
church
.

St.
Bartholomew
's
Church
was
built
in
0000
.

Even
though
Bernard
Wilmore
,
at
the
time
of
his
death
(
0000
)
,
had
left
a
small
parcel
of
land
,
in
the
center
of
town
,
to
Father
Gallitzin
to
be
used
as
a
church
.

Father
Gallitzin
's
executors
sold
the
property
and
it
is
currently
where
the
Evangelical
Lutheran
Church
now
stands

Caerlaverock
Castle
is
a

ed
triangular
castle
,
first
built
in
the
00th
century
.

It
is
located
south
of
Dumfries
in
south-west
Scotland
,
on
the
edge
of
the
Caerlaverock
National
Nature
Reserve
.

Caerlaverock
was
a
stronghold
of
the
Maxwell
family
from
the
00th
century
until
the
00th
century
when
the
castle
was
abandoned
.

It
was
besieged
by
the
English
during
the
Wars
of
Scottish
Independence
,
and
underwent
several
partial
demolitions
and
reconstructions
over
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
.

In
the
00th
century
,
the
Maxwells
were
created
Earls
of
Nithsdale
,
and
built
a
new
lodging
within
the
walls
,

the
most

domestic
architecture
in

.

It

protected
as
a
scheduled
monument
,
and
as
a
category
A
listed
building
.

Ownership
The
history
of
its
builders
can
be
traced
to
Undwin

son
Maccus
in
the
eleventh
century
;
Maccus
gave
his
name
to
the
barony
of

and
Mearns
(
d.
0000
)
rebuilt
Caerlaverock
castle
and
was
succeeded
by

of
Caerlaverock
(
d.

History
The

preceded
by
several
fortifications
in

area
:
a
Roman
fort
on
Ward
Law
Hill
and
a
British
hill
fort
that

,
when
they
were
granted
to
the
monks
of
Holm
Cultram
Abbey
.

Around
0000
Alexander
II
of
Scotland
granted
the
lands
to
Sir
John

,
making
him
Warden
of
the
West
March
.

Sir
John

of
Scotland
from

work
on
the
first
castle

of
the
earliest
stone
castles
to
be
built
in
Scotland
.

It
had
a
moat
with
a
bridge
facing
north
.

Only
the
foundations
and
remains
of
a
wooden
enclosure
around
it
remain
.

This
early
castle
may
have
been
incomplete
when
it
was
abandoned
in
favour
of
a
rock
outcrop
some
to
the
north
.

It
was
here
that
Sir
John
's
brother
Sir
Aymer
Maxwell
began
construction
of
the
present
castle
.

Sir
Aymer
also
served
as
Chamberlain
in
0000
–
0000
,
and
was
Justiciar
of
Galloway
in
0000
.

In
the
0000s
the
"
new
"
castle
was
completed
,
and
Herbert
Maxwell
,
nephew
of
John
Maxwell
,
occupied
it
.

Wars
of
Independence
In
0000
,
the
garrison
of
Caerlaverock
attacked
Lochmaben
Castle
which
was
held
by
English
forces
.

In
0000
,
Edward
I
of
England
marched
north
with
eighty
seven
of
the
Barons
of
England
in
his
host
,
as
well
as
knights
of
Brittany
and
Lorraine
.

The
Maxwells
,
under
their
chief
,
Sir
Eustace
Maxwell
,
made
a
vigorous
defence
that
repelled
the
English
several
times
.

In
the
end
the
garrison
were
compelled
to
surrender
,
after
which
it
was
found
that
only
sixty
men
had
defied
the
whole
English
army
for
a
considerable
period
.

In
recent
years
,
Historic
Scotland
has
organised
re-enactment
s
of
the
Siege
.

During
the
siege
the
English
heralds
composed
a
roll
of
arms
in
the
form
of
verses
of
poetry
,
each
describing
the
feats
of
valour
of
each
noble
and
knight
present
,
with
a
blazon
of
his
armorials
.

The
Roll
of
Caerlaverock
is
thus
a
very
important
primary
source
for
students
of
heraldry
.

Possession
of
the
castle
was
subsequently
restored
to
Sir
Eustace
Maxwell
,
Sir
Herbert
's
son
,
who
at
first
embraced
the
cause
of
John
Balliol
,
and
in
0000
received
from
Edward
I
an
allowance
of
£
00
for
the
more
secure
keeping
of
the
castle
.

He
afterwards
gave
in
his
adherence
to
Robert
Bruce
,
and
his
castle
,
in
consequence
,
underwent
a
second
siege
by
the
English
,
in
which
they
were
unsuccessful
.

Fearing
that
this
important
stronghold
might
ultimately
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
,
and
enable
them
to
make
good
their
hold
on
the
district
,
Sir
Eustace
dismantled
the
fortress
,
a
service
and
sacrifice
for
which
he
was
liberally
rewarded
by
Robert
Bruce
.

By
0000
the
castle
was
once
again
inhabited
,
and
Sir
Eustace
now
changed
sides
again
,
giving
his
support
to
Edward
Balliol
.

Around
0000
Sir
Roger
Kirkpatrick
of
Closeburn
captured
Caerlaverock
for
David
II
of
Scotland
,
and
partly
dimantled
the
castle
.

Repair
and
rebuilding
By
the
end
of
the
Wars
of
Independence
in
the
mid
00th
century
,
Caerlaverock
had
been
regained
by
the
Maxwells
,
with
Sir
Robert
Maxwell
rebuilding
much
of
the
castle
between
0000
and
0000
.

Further
work
was
undertaken
by
Robert
,
0nd
Lord
Maxwell
,
in
the
mid
00th
century
,
probably
involving
reconstruction
of
the
gatehouse
.

A
new
west
range
was
added
within
the
walls
around
0000
.

The
Catholic
Maxwells
took
up
the
cause
of
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
,
after
her
forced
abdication
in
0000
.

Caerlaverock
was
besieged
in
0000
by
an
English
Protestant
force
led
by
the
Earl
of
Sussex
,
and
was
again
partly
demolished
,
including
the
destruction
of
the
gatehouse
with
gunpowder
.

By
0000
,
John
,
0th
Lord
Maxwell
was
repairing
the
castle
again
,
building
up
the
gatehouse
for
defence
against
the
Johnstones
of
Annandale
,
with
whom
the
Maxwells
were
feuding
.

The
0th
Lord
was
killed
by
the
Johnstones
during
a
fight
at
Dryfe
Sands
,
and
in
0000
the
0th
Lord
Maxwell
was
executed
for
the
revenge
murder
of
Sir
James
Johnstone
.

Earls
of
Nithsdale
In
0000
Robert
,
00th
Lord
Maxwell
,
married
Elizabeth
Beaumont
,
cousin
of
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
a
favourite
of
James
VI
of
Scotland
.

He
was
subsequently
created
Earl
of
Nithsdale
and
appointed
to
the
Privy
Council
of
Scotland
.

To
reflect
his
new
status
he
built
the
elaborate
south
and
east
ranges
within
the
castle
,
known
as
the
Nithsdale
Lodging
.

The
new
ranges
were
completed
around
0000
,
but
further
religious
turmoil
soon
turned
against
the
Catholic
Maxwells
.

In
0000
the
Protestant
Covenanter
army
besieged
Caerlaverock
for
00
weeks
,
eventually
forcing
its
surrender
.

The
south
wall
and
tower
were
demolished
,
and
the
castle
was
never
repaired
or
reoccupied
.

Protected
areas
Caerlaverock
Castle
is
within
the
Nith
Estuary
National
Scenic
Area
,
protected
for
its
scenic
qualities
,
with
the
castle
recognised
as
a
landmark
of
the
area
.

The
castle
is
at
the
northern
edge
of
the
Caerlaverock
National
Nature
Reserve
,
which
extends
to
and
consists
of
saltmarsh
,
mudflats
and
grazing
land
.

It
is
an
internationally
important
wintering
site
for

"
bear
mountain
"
in
the
language
of
the
native
Lenape
people
,
an
apparent
reference
to
a
local
mountain
that
resembled
a
sleeping
bear
.

The
town
was
founded
by
Josiah
White
,
founder
of
the
Lehigh
Coal
&
Navigation
Company
.

It
rapidly
became
a
railroad
and
coal
-
shipping
center
,
and
was
home
to
the
Mauch
Chunk
Switchback
Gravity
Railroad
,
generally
acknowledged
as
the
first
roller
coaster
in
the
United
States
.

Mauch
Chunk
was
the
location
of
one
of
the
trials
of
the
Molly
Maguires
in
0000
,
which
resulted
in
the
hanging
of
four
men
found
guilty
of
murder
.

The
population
in
0000
was
0,000
;
in
0000
,
it
was
0,000
.

Following
the
0000
death
of
renowned
athlete
and
Olympic
medal
winner
Jim
Thorpe
,
Thorpe
's
widow
and
third
wife
,
Patricia
,
were
angry
when
the
government
of
Oklahoma
would
not
erect
a
memorial
to
honor
him
.

When
she
heard
that
the
boroughs
of
Mauch
Chunk
and
East
Mauch
Chunk
were
desperately
seeking
to
attract
business
,
she
made
a
deal
with
civic
officials
.

According
to
Jim
Thorpe
's
son
,
Jack
,
Patricia
was
motivated
by
money
in
seeking
the
deal
.

The
boroughs
merged
,
renamed
the
new
municipality
in
Jim
Thorpe
's
honor
,
obtained
the
athlete
's
remains
from
his
wife
and
erected
a
monument
to
the
Oklahoma
native
,
who
began
his
sports
career
southwest
,
as
a
student
at
the
Carlisle
Indian
Industrial
School
in
Carlisle
,
Pennsylvania
.

The
monument
site
contains
his
tomb
,
two
statues
of
him
in
athletic
poses
,
and
historical
markers
describing
his
life
story
.

The
grave
rests
on
mounds
of
soil
from
Thorpe
's
native
Oklahoma
and
from
the
Stockholm
Olympic
Stadium
in
which
he
won
his
Olympic
medals
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
one
of
Jim
Thorpe
's
sons
,
Jack
Thorpe
,
sued
the
town
for
his
father
's
remains
under
a
Federal
law
designed
to
return
Native
American
artifacts
to
their
tribal
homelands
.

The
history
of
the
borough
is
inscribed
in
the
architecture
that
makes
up
its
many
00th
century
styles
.

Former
resident
and
architectural
historian
Hans
Egli
noted
the
vast
range
of
architectural
styles
:
Federalist
,
Greek
Revival
,
Second
Empire
,
Romanesque
Revival
,
Queen
Anne
,
and
Richardsonian
Romanesque
.

Most
of
these
architectural
examples
remained
intact
beneath
aluminum
or
vinyl
siding
that
has
since
been
removed
.

Robert
Venturi
,
renowned
Philadelphia
architect
,
conducted
a
little-known
planning
study
in
the
0000s
that
attempted
to
understand
the
dynamics
of
historicism
and
tourism
,
notions
that
have
come
into
their
own
in
contemporary
times
.

While
Venturi
's
planning
study
was
unique
at
the
time
,
it
has
since
become
a
critical
factor
in
Jim
Thorpe
's
rebound
as
a
functioning
and
economically
stable
community
.

Jim
Thorpe
benefits
from
tourism
initially
spurred
on
by
the
celebration
of
its
old
architecture
,
which
has
developed
new
industries
and
modern
creations
.

Two
of
these
relative
newcomers
to
the
Jim
Thorpe
area
are
paintball
and
white
water
rafting
.

the

Company
,
a
coal
mining
and
shipping
company
with
operations
in
Summit
Hill
,
Pennsylvania
,
constructed
an
downhill
track
,
known
as
a
gravity
railroad
,
to
deliver
coal
(
and
a
miner
to
operate
the
mine
train
's

)
to
the
Lehigh
Canal
in
Mauch
Chunk
.

This
helped
open
up
the

helped
to
fuel
the
Industrial

.

By

(
equal

)
.

It
is
often
cited
as
the
first
roller

in

Lehighton
is
a
borough
in
Carbon
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
north
by
west
of
Philadelphia
.

In
the
past
,
it
developed
early
industries
because
of
water
power
from
the
Lehigh
River
.

With
the
location
of
a
repair
facility
here
and
its
regional
operations
,
the
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
became
for
years
a
major
employer
of
thousands
of
people
from
the
area
.

Post
-
World
War
II
railroad
and
industry
restructuring
led
to
job
and
population
losses
.

From
a
peak
of
nearly
0,000
in
0000
,
the
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Lehighton
is
the
most
populous
borough
in
Carbon
County
and
still
the
business
hub
of
the
county
.

Lehighton
is
located
in
northeast
Pennsylvania
north/northwest
of
Allentown
and
south
of
Wilkes-Barre
.

Lehighton
's
elevation
varies
from
000
feet
on
Routes
000
and
000
up
to
000
feet
near
the
northwest
part
of
town
by
Mahoning
Township
border
.

History
At
the
time
of
European
encounter
with
historic
American
Indian
tribes
,
this
area
was
part
of
the
territory
of
the
Lenape
(
also
called
Delaware
,
after
their
language
and
territory
on
the
Delaware
River
.

Their
bands
occupied
much
of
the
coastal
mid-Atlantic
area
in
Delaware
,
New
Jersey
,
Pennsylvania
and
New
York
.
)

Lehighton
was
built
on
the
site
of
the
German
Moravian
Brethren
's
mission
station
Gnadenhütten
(
cabins
of
grace
)
founded
in
0000
.

It
was
established
as
a
mission
to
the
Lenape
by
Moravians
from
Bethlehem
,
Pennsylvania
,
lower
on
the
Lehigh
River
.

The
German
name
was
transcribed
as
"
Canatanheat
"
by
missionary
John
Brainerd
.

During
the
French
and
Indian
Wars
(
Seven
Years
War
)
,
Native
allies
of
the
French
killed
00
missionaries
and
Lenape
(
Delaware
)
convert
ed
Christians
at
Gnadenhutten
on
00
November
0000
.

They
destroyed
the
mission
village
and
only
four
of
the
fifteen
residents
escaped
.

(
During
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
in
0000
Pennsylvania
militia
raided
another
Moravian
mission
village
,
also
called
Gnadenhutten
,
in
present-day
Ohio
.

Suspecting
the
Lenape
of
being
allied
with
the
British
,
the
militia
killed
00
unarmed
men
,
women
,
and
children
in
what
became
better
known
as
the
Gnadenhutten
Massacre
.
)

The
Lehigh
River
was
a
source
of
water
power
for
developing
industries
in
the
00th
century
.

Lehighton
had
silk
and
lace
mills
,
a
meat-packing
house
,
shirt
factory
,
automatic-press
works
,
car
shops
,
stoneworks
,
and
foundries
.

In
0000
,
the
population
was
0,000
people
.

By
0000
,
it
reached
0,000
.

The
coming
of
the
railroad
made
it
easier
for
businessmen
to
get
their
products
to
major
markets
.

For
many
years
,
the
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
had
a
major
repair
facility
in
Lehighton
.

The
coming
of
the
railroad
was
a
major
economic
boost
for
the
town
.

It
was
the
area
's
largest
company
,
employing
several
thousand
workers
at
the
repair
facilities
or
operating
and
maintaining
the
railroad
.

Restructuring
in
the
railroad
industry
led
to
the
repair
facilities
being
moved
to
another
location
.

Lost
jobs
meant
that
some
people
had
to
relocate
for
work
.

In
typical
post
-
World
War
II
developments
,
the
Lehighton
downtown
declined
after
Carbon
Plaza
Mall
was
built
in
nearby
Mahoning
Township
.

Suburban
housing
developed
,
pulling
more
businesses
from
downtown
.

After
struggling
for
three
decades
,
the
downtown
is
experiencing
a
rebirth
as
people
appreciate
the
qualities
of
a
compact
central
location
and
historic
architecture
.

The
town
holds
an
annual
civic
event
,
"
Bike
Night
"
,
featuring
more
than
00,000
motorcyclists
.

In
late
September
through
October
,
the
Country
Junction
store
sponsors
"
The
Great
Pocono
Pumpkin
Festival
"
.

It
features
hayrides
,
walks
in
haunted
woods
,
and
cornfield
maze
s.
The
town
is
also
on
a
north-south
bird
migration
pattern
,
and
birds
can
be
frequently
seen
flying
south
in
mass
in
the
fall
.

One
particularly
tall
grey
rooftop
overlooking
the
Lehigh
River
on
the
Rt.

bridge
is
a
frequent
stop
for
migrating

Palmerton
is
a
borough
in
Carbon
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

It
is
located
in
the
coal
region
of
the

.

It
is
a
part
of
lower
Carbon
County
,
which
is
considered

the
Lehigh
Valley
and
the
greater
Allentown
Metropolitan

.

The

census
.

History
Native
Americans
lived
in
the
area
that
is
now
Palmerton
for
many
years
.

Early
European
settlers
established
the
villages
of
Hazard
and
Little
Gap
,
which
were
part
of
Lower
Towamensing
Township
.

There
was
also
an
underground
railroad
station
there
.

In
0000
,
the
New
Jersey
Zinc
Company
located
a
zinc
smelting
operation
(
what
is
now
the
West
Plant
)
here
,
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
anthracite
coal
being
mined
just
north
of
Palmerton
and
the
zinc
mines
in
Franklin
,
New
Jersey
.

The
town
was
named
after
New
Jersey
Zinc
's
then-President
,
Stephen
S.
Palmer
,
though
Palmer
was
reportedly
not
pleased
with
having
his
name
on
the
town
.

A
second
location
,
the
East
Plant
,
was
established
on
the
other
side
of
town
in
0000
.

Though
other
industries
,
such
as
several
garment
manufacturing
shops
,
came
to
Palmerton
,
the
zinc
company
was
the
major
employer
for
most
of
the
town
's
history
.

Much
of
the
population
was
brought
to
the
site
,
principally
from
Eastern
Europe
,
in
order
to
work
in
the
zinc
plants
.

Palmerton
was
officially
incorporated
in
0000
.

Zinc
smelting
was
ended
in
0000
due
to
a
poor
zinc
market
and
environmental
regulation
.

The
West
Plant
was
demolished
in
0000
.

The
East
Plant
continues
to
operate
at
reduced
capacity
,
processing
electric
arc
furnace
dust
into
zinc
calcine
.

Palmerton
once

,
"
which

necessary

.

On
the
other
hand
,
many
citizens
,
including
the
Pro-Palmerton
Coalition
(
PPC
)
,
argue
that
the
health
risks
are
exaggerated
and
that
the
town
's
Superfund
status
stigmatizes
it
.

Both

Each
issue
's
cover
carries
the
advisory
label
"
Suggested
for
mature
readers
"
(
regardless
of
a
specific
issue
's
content
)
.

In
early
0000
,
Karen
Berger
left
her
role
as
the
executive
editor
of
the
imprint
,
having
overseen
it
since
its
inception
in
0000
.

Vertigo
comics
series
have
won
the
comics
industry
's
Eisner
Award
,
including
the
Best
Continuing
Series
of
various
years
(
The
Sandman
,
Preacher
,
000
Bullets
and
Fables
)
.

Several
of
its
publications
have
been
adapted
to
film
,
including
Hellblazer
,
A
History
of
Violence
,
Stardust
,
and
V
for
Vendetta
.

In
0000
,
it
was
announced
that
Vertigo
would
become
a
strictly
creator-owned
imprint
,
with
all
titles
that
originated
in
the
DC
Universe
,
with
the
exception
of
flagship
title
Hellblazer
,
returning
to
the
DC
imprint
.

This
includes
characters
related
to
Swamp
Thing
,
The
Sandman
,
Madame
Xanadu
,
Black
Orchid
,
The
Books
of
Magic
,
House
of
Mystery
,
Sandman
Mystery
Theatre
,
The
Haunted
Tank
,
The
Unknown
Soldier
,
and
Shade
,
the
Changing
Man
.

This
had
already
been
done
with
Animal
Man
,
Doom
Patrol
,
and
The
Human
Target
.

History
Vertigo
originated
in
0000
under
the
stewardship
of
Karen
Berger
,
a
Brooklyn
College
graduate
with
a
degree
in
English
Literature
and
a
minor
in
Art
History
,
who
had
joined
DC
Comics
in
0000
as
an
assistant
to
editor
Paul
Levitz
,
debuting
with
House
of
Mystery
#
000
after
a
Sgt.
Rock
reprint
collection
.

In
the
final
issue
of
House
of
Mystery
,
#
000
,
she
was
depicted
in
the
comics
as
personally
evicting
Cain
from
the
House
.

Ironically
,
as
condescending
as
she
was
portrayed
treating
him
,
she
was
instrumental
in
the
character
's
continued
development
at
DC
.

By
the
mid-0000s
,
Berger
,
then
editor
of
such
DC
titles
as
Wonder
Woman
and
Amethyst
,
Princess
of
Gemworld
,
began
assigning
writers
from
the
UK
.

These
included
Neil
Gaiman
,
whom
she
met
in
0000
on
a
talent-scouting
trip
,
as
well
as
Peter
Milligan
and
Grant
Morrison
.

She
"
found
their
sensibility
and
point
of
view
to
be
refreshingly
different
,
edgier
and
smarter
"
than
those
of
most
American
comics
writers
,
and
worked
with
them
and
others
on
the
superhero
/
science
fiction
series
Animal
Man
,
Doom
Patrol
vol
.

0
,
and
Shade
,
the
Changing
Man
vol
.

0
;
the
Black
Orchid
miniseries
(
Neil
Gaiman
's
first
work
for
DC
)
,
the
fantasy
series
The
Sandman
vol
.

0
,
and
the
horror
titles
Hellblazer
and
The
Saga
of
the
Swamp
Thing
,
that
last
written
by
Alan
Moore
,
a
British
writer
inherited
from
previous
editor
Len
Wein
.

These
seven
titles
,
all
of
which
carried
a
"
Suggested
for
Mature
Readers
"
label
on
their
covers
,
and
shared
a
sophistication-driven
sensibility
the
fan
press
dubbed
"
the
Bergerverse
,
would
form
the
initial
basis
of
Vertigo
.

In
a
0000
editorial
meeting
with
Berger
,
Levitz
,
DC
publisher
Jenette
Kahn
and
managing
editor
Dick
Giordano
,
Berger
was
given
the
mandate
to
place
these
titles
under
an
imprint
that
,
as
Berger
described
,
would
"
do
something
different
in
comics
and
help
the
medium
'
grow
up
'
"
.

Several
DC
titles
bearing
the
label
,
such
as
Green
Arrow
,
which
had
it
from
vol
.

0

(

-
#
00
(
Late
June
0000
)
,
were
not
allowed
to
make
the
leap
to
the
new
imprint
.

The
Question
had
borne
the
label
from
issue
#
0
(
September
0000
)
to
its
cancellation
in
Spring
0000
,
and
also
never
became
a
Vertigo
title
.

Other
"
suggested
for
mature
readers
"
titles
to
pre-date
Vertigo
include
Vigilante
,
Haywire
,
and
Skreemer
,
and
miniseries
and
one-shots
such
as
Gilgamesh
II
,
Tailgunner
Jo
,
World
Without
End
,
Mister
E
,
and
Batman
:
The
Killing
Joke
.

These
mature
readers
comics
,
both
those
that
became
Vertigo
and
those
that
did
not
,
often
had
the
DC
bullet
printed
in
a
smaller
than
usual
size
.

Several
of
the
earliest
new
Vertigo
series
derived
from
Disney
Comics
'
aborted
Touchmark
Comics
imprint
,
a
line
announced
before
the
so-called
"
Disney
Implosion
"
of
0000
,
and
subsequently
abandoned
.

Touchmark
was
to
be
helmed
at
Disney
by
ex-DC
editor
Art
Young
,
but
when
it
was
jettisoned
,
both
Young
and
the
properties
were
acquired
by
DC
forming
part
of
the
debut
Vertigo
line
.

Berger
notes
that
"
when
Art
Young
became
available
with
the
Touchmark
properties
...
that
helped
facilitate
the
line
,
"
and
the
influx
of
projects
allowed
Berger
to
"
double
[
her
]
proposed
publishing
plan
.
"

Touchmark
titles
included
Enigma
,
Sebastian
O
,
Mercy
,
and
Shadows
Fall
.

In
early
December
0000
,
Karen
Berger
announced
that
she
would
be
leaving
the
company
in
March
0000
,
marking
twenty
years
with
Vertigo
and
00
years
with
DC
Comics
,
making
her
longest-running
DC
employee
.

Titles
Early

Having
spearheaded
the
"
British
invasion

"
by
head-hunting
such
writers
as
Moore
,
Gaiman
,
Delano
,
Grant
Morrison
,
Garth
Ennis
and
Peter
Milligan
,
Berger
was
well
suited
to
head
up
the
new
line
,
as
she
was
already
editing
many
of
the
series
which
would
form
the
core
of
the
early
Vertigo
output
.

,
Doom

,

,
and
Shade
,
the

#

,
the
first
new
comic
book
printed
under
the
"
Vertigo
"
imprint
was
Death
:
The
High
Cost
of
Living
#
0
,
debuting
a
scant
couple
of
weeks
before
Enigma
#
0
in
January
(
March
)
0000
.

Of
these
ongoing
titles
,
Hellblazer
was
the
last
to
be
canceled
,
ceasing
publication
in
February
0000
with
its
000th
issue
.

Having
inherited
some
projects
from
Disney
's
aborted
Touchmark
project
,
Vertigo
was
able
to
plan
a
first
year
in
which
they
were
to
publish
"
two
new
series
[
per
]
month
in
a
variety
of
formats
,
either
one-shot
s
or
miniseries
or
ongoing
monthlies
.
"

The
initial
two
series
were
both
miniseries
,
the
aforementioned
Death
:
The
High
Cost
of
Living
by
Neil
Gaiman
and
Chris
Bachalo
and
Enigma
by
Peter
Milligan
and
Duncan
Fegredo
.

Enigma
was
initially
"
going
to
be
the
launch
book
of
[
Disney
's
]
Touchmark
,
"
but
became
the
second
new
Vertigo
title
,
written
by
the
author
Shade
,
the
Changing
Man
,
and
drawn
by
the
artist
from
Grant
Morrison
's
earlier
Kid
Eternity
miniseries
.

The
major
launch
of
the
second
month
was
Sandman
:
Mystery
Theatre
,
described
by
Berger
as
in
the
same
format
as
Batman
:
Legends
of
the
Dark
Knight
,
"
with
different
storylines
every
four
issues
.
"

Written
by
Matt
Wagner
,
it
was
described
as
"
playing
the
'00s
with
a
'00s
feel
...
haunting
,
film
noir
-
ish
...
,
"
and
starring
original
Sandman
Wesley
Dodds
in
a
title
whose
"
sensibilities
echo
crime
genre
fiction
.
"

Joining
Mystery
Theatre
in
February
(
cover-dated
April
,
0000
)
was
J.
Marc
DeMatteis
(
and
Paul
Johnson
)
's
00-page
one-shot
Mercy
,
while
other
initially
talked
about
Vertigo
projects
included
Grant
Morrison
and
Steve
Yeowell
's
0-issue
steampunk
miniseries
Sebastian
O
—
another
ex-Touchmark
project
.

In
addition
,
Steve
Gerber
,
an
influential
force
on
many
of
the
Vertigo
writers
,
provided
the
miniseries
Nevada
,
which
was
written
based
on
Neil
Gaiman
's
reiteration
of
a
frequent
request
to
write
something
more
about
the
characters
in
"
the
obligatory
comic
book
fight
scene
"
in
Howard
the
Duck
#

.

Debut
authors
Although
regularly
cited
as
one
of
the
major
forces
behind
the
creation
of
Vertigo
comics
,
none
of
the
launch
titles
were
written
by
Alan
Moore
(
having
long-left
Swamp
Thing
,
and
only
created
the
character
of
,
but
never
written
the
spin-off
solo
title
—
Hellblazer
)
.

None
of
the
initial
launch
titles
written
by
Grant
Morrison
,
either
who
had
similarly
finished
his
seminal
runs
on
both
Animal
Man
and
Doom
Patrol
under
the
DC
logo
.

Instead
,
the
key
launch
Vertigo
writers
were
part
of
the
"
second
wave
"
of
British
talent
,
focused
in
large
part
around
Gaiman
,
whose
Sandman
was
so
critical
to
the
decision
to
create
Vertigo
,
and
whose
Death
miniseries
launched
it
.

Peter
Milligan
penned
the
other
new
series
,
Enigma
,
and
continued
Shade
,
the
Changing
Man
,
while
Ennis
continued
Hellblazer
,
Delano
wrote
Animal
Man
,
Fantasy
author
Rachel
Pollack
took
over
Doom
Patrol
and
horror
author
Nancy
Collins
wrote
Swamp
Thing
.

The
ninth
comic
launched
at
Vertigo
's
0000
debut
was
the
Vertigo
Preview
,
showcasing
the
concurrently
released
titles
,
as
well
as
J.
M.
DeMatteis
'
Mercy
,
Ann
Nocenti
's
Kid
Eternity
(
an
ongoing
series
spun
off
from
the
earlier
Morrison-penned
miniseries
)
,
Dick
Foreman
's
Black
Orchid
(
an
on-going
series
spun
off
from
the
Gaiman/McKean
miniseries
)
and
Matt
Wagner
's
Sandman
Mystery
Theatre
.

Style
and
promotion
Although
the
books
did
not
have
a
consistent
visual
style
,
the
cover
designs
of
early
Vertigo
series
featured
a
uniform
trade
dress
with
a
vertical
bar
along
the
left
side
,
which
included
the
imprint
logo
,
pricing
,
date
,
and
issue
numbers
.

The
initial
Vertigo
'
look
'
"
was
created
so
people
who
see
the
books
will
automatically
know
it
's
[
a
Vertigo
title
]
.
"

The
design
layout
continued
with
very
little
variation
until
issues
cover-dated
July
0000
(
including
Fables
#
0
)
which
introduced
an
across-the-top
layout
ahead
of
0000
's
"
Vertigo
X
"
00th
anniversary
celebration
.

The
"
distinctive
design
"
was
designed
to
be
used
on
"
all
Vertigo
books
except
the
hardcovers
,
trade
paperbacks
,
and
graphic
novels
.
"

Berger
noted
that
DC
was
"
very
"
committed
to
line
,
having
put
a
"
lot
of
muscle
behind
"
promoting
it
,
including
a
promotional
launch
kit
made
available
to
"
[
r
]
etailers
who
order
[
ed
]
at
least
00
copies
of
the
February
issue
of
Sandman
[
#
00
]
,
"
a
"
Platinum
edition
"
variant
cover
for
Death
:
The
High
Cost
of
Living
#
0
and
a
00c
Vertigo
Preview
comic
featuring
a
specially
written
seven-page
Sandman
story
by
Gaiman
and
Kent
Williams
.

In
addition
,
a
00-page
Vertigo
Sampler
was
also
produced
and
bundled
with
copies
of
Capital
City
Distribution
's
Advance
Comics
solicitation
index
.

Format
In
addition
to
the
initially
announced
projects
,
Berger
noted
that
,
due
to
the
then
fluctuating
state
of
the
comics
market
,
the
Vertigo
line
was
erring
on
the
side
of
"
blue
line
art
or
flat
colors
"
rather
than
fully
painted
works
,
because
"
the
market
seems
to
be
really
price-sensitive
.
"

Although
Vertigo
released
several
"
new
format
"
and
"
Prestige
format
"
titles
,
Berger
noted
that
they
had
"
to
be
really
selective
"
with
choosing
to
present
stories
in
those
formats
solely
"
if
the
story
can
only
be
done
that
way
,
"
rather
than
as
a
default
.

0000
–
present
Formerly
non-Vertigo
titlesThe
Vertigo
imprint
,
devoted
specifically
to
titles
for
mature
readers
,
has
also
been
retroactively
applied
to
later
reprints
of
material
previously
published
under
other
DC
imprints
.

In
addition
to
the
earlier
issues
of
the
such
initially
DC
ongoing
series
as
Doom
Patrol
and
Swamp
Thing
,
other
"
mature
readers
"
works
such
as
V
for
Vendetta
have
later
been
subsumed
into
the
Vertigo
line
.

Books
from
discontinued
imprints
which
have
individual
staying-power
also
been
rebranded
,
most
notably
Transmetropolitan
,
which
initially
launched
under
DC
's
short-lived
sci-fi
Helix
imprint
,
but
switched
to
Vertigo
with
issue
#
00
(
September
0000
)
and
ran
for
a
further
00
issues
and
four
years
;
and
A
History
of
Violence
which
was
originally
published
as
part
of
DC
's
Paradox
Press
line
,
but
reprinted
under
the
Vertigo
imprint
when
it
was
adapted
into
a
motion
picture
.

Other
quirky
,
"
mature
"
or
"
horror
"
series
have
seen
collections
sold
under
the
Vertigo
banner
,
including
a
"
best
of
"
collection
of
the
Silver
Age
Comics
Code
-
approved
House
of
Mystery
(
as
July
0000
's
Welcome
Back
to
the
House
of
Mystery
)
—
a
forerunner
of
Vertigo
's
founding
horror/fantasy
series
—
and
a
reprint
of
its
pre-code
first
issue
from
0000
.

Relationship
to
DC
UniverseAlthough
many
of
the
initial
Vertigo
publications
were
set
in
the
DC
Universe
(
Shade
,
Doom
Patrol
,
Swamp
Thing
,
Hellblazer
,
Animal
Man
,
Black
Orchid
,
The
Books
of
Magic
and
The
Sandman
all
fit
into
the
broader
DC
Universe
,
and
have
interacted
with
DC
heroes
including
Superman
and
Batman
)
,
even
pre-Vertigo
the
"
mature
reader
"
titles
occupied
a
particular
"
dark
corner
"
of
the
mainstream
DCU
,
and
the
establishment
of
the
imprint
continued
to
distance
the
in-Universe
series
from
full
DC-branded
continuity
.

Appearances
in
DC
series
by
characters
appearing
in
Vertigo
series
were
very
uncommon
(
notable
exceptions
include
Sandmans
Daniel
appearing
in
two
issues
of
Grant
Morrison
's
0000
relaunch
of
core-DCU
title
JLA
)
,
while
events
which
had
a
"
global
"
impact
in
the
books
of
one
imprint
were
not
seen
in
the
books
of
the
other
,
(
e.g.
Vertigo
's
"
The
Children
's
Crusade
"
crossover
or
DC
's
"
Bloodlines
"
crossover
(
except
for
Swamp
Thing
,
who
appeared
in
The
New
Titans
issue
of
the
latter
)
,
both
in
0000
)
.

However
,
several
characters
used
in
Gaiman
's
Sandman
,
The
Books
of
Magic
,
John
Constantine
and
Black
Orchid
have
all
appeared
briefly
in
mainstream
DC
comics
,
while
other
characters
(
primarily
in
the
magical
and
supernatural
grey
area
between
mainstream
and
mature
lines
)
have
spanned
the
universes
—
the
0000
Zatanna
special
"
Everyday
Magic
"
was
published
as
a
Vertigo
title
,
while
Zatanna
herself
remains
rooted
in
the
DC
Universe
,
and
the
0000
Madame
Xanadu
series
was
also
released
under
the
Vertigo
imprint
.

Characters
from
the
DC
Universe
have
commonly
made
guest
appearances
in
Vertigo
comics
,
including
Mirror
Master
Evan
McCulloch
,
Jonny
Double
,
Etrigan
the
Demon
,
Zatanna
's
enemy
Mammon
,
Christopher
Chance
,
Jonah
Hex
and
The
Phantom
Stranger
.

Finally
,
Vertigo
miniseries
featuring
DC
Universe
characters
appear
from
time
to
time
,
including
the
above-mentioned
Zatanna
one-shot
,
and
characters
such
as
Doctor
Occult
.

Borderline
DC/Vertigo
titles
Animal
Man
and
Doom
Patrol
sit
uneasily
between
the
Universes
,
both
having
begun
as
merely
quirky
titles
in
the
mainstream
universe
,
but
becoming
part
of
the
Vertigo
launch
line-up
in
0000
by
dint
of
their
increasingly
separate
and
"
mature
"
storylines
.

Both
eventually
returned
to
regular
appearances
under
the
main
DC
imprint
after
their
Vertigo
series
were
cancelled
,
and
Doom
Patrol
has
seen
subsequent
volumes
released
under
the
DC
banner
,
while
Animal
Man
played
an
integral
role
in
recent
DC
year-long
events
00
and
Countdown
.

Due
to
the
change
in
DC
's
editorial
policy
,
it
has
been
announced
that
many
of
these
titles
'
characters
will
return
to
the
DC
Universe
proper
.

For
example
,
Death
of
the
Endless
from
The
Sandman
appeared
in
a
0000
storyline
of
Action
Comics
,
where
she
encountered
Lex
Luthor
.

In
addition
,
0000
saw
the
return
of
John
Constantine
to
the
mainstream
DC
Universe
in
the
aftermath
of
the
Brightest
Day
storyline
.

At
the
end
of
the
0000
mini-series
"
Flashpoint
"
the
Vertigo
timeline
merges
with
the
DC
timeline
and
the
Wildstorm
Universe
as
well
,
the
character
Pandora
stated
that
the
three
timelines
were
split
up
to
weaken
them
for
an
inpending
crisis
and
they
must
be
reunited
,
creating
a
new
DC
universe
.

It
has
also
been
revealed
,
as
part
of
the
reboot
of
the
DC
Universe
,
many
of
these
characters
appeared
in
DC
's
"
the
Dark
"
line
of
supernatural
and
horror
comics
.

For
example
,
Constantine
,
Shade
the
Changing
Man
,
Madame
Xanadu
,
and
other
prominent
magic-users
in
the
DC
Universe
appear
in
Justice
League
Dark
,
and
Swamp
Thing
and
Animal
Man
have
their
self-titled
series
.

Creator-owned
series
Much
of
Vertigo
's
output
inhabits
its
own
"
universe
,
"
and
is
set
completely
apart
from
the
DC
universe
(
and
from
other
Vertigo
titles
—
there
is
no
"
Vertigo
Universe
"
per
se
)
,
automatically
putting
to
rest
to
any
continuity
quibbles
between
the
two
.

Vertigo
was
the
first
successful
imprint
of
DC
Comics
to
routinely
publish
creator-owned
series
,
right
from
its
launch
,
with
Peter
Milligan
and
Duncan
Fegredo
's
Enigma
.

From
the
start
,
Berger
was
committed
to
creator-owned
projects
,
working
on
several
"
[
her
]
self
with
new
writers
and
artists
"
as
well
as
established
names
,
with
the
express
intention
of
"
trying
to
bring
new
people
into
the
industry
,
as
well
as
use
some
of
the
best
creators
in
comics
.
"

Current
ongoing
series
None
of
the
series
which
existed
before
the
formation
of
Vertigo
are
still
ongoing
,
with
Hellblazer
s
February
0000
cancellation
.

Former
ongoing
series
Original
graphic
novels
Trade
paperbacks
The
(
financial
)
success
of
many
Vertigo
titles
relies
not
on
monthly
issue
sales
,
but
on
the
subsequent
"
trade
paperback
"
editions
which
reprint
the
monthly
comics
in
volumes
which
are
sold
not
merely
in
comic
shops
,
but
in
all
bookshops
.

Vertigo
's
success
in
popularizing
the
trade
paperback
collection
led
to
a
wider
take-up
in
the
American
comics
industry
of
routinely
reprinting
monthly
series
in
this
format
.

Limited
series
(
ideal
for
later
collection
)
and
original
graphic
novels
make
up
the
majority
of
the
imprint
's
output
,
with
TPB
sales
accounting
for
a
substantial
segment
of
the
imprint
's
sales
.

Sub-imprints
and
brandings
Over
its
fifteen-year
history
,
the
Vertigo
imprint
has
experimented
with
a
number
of
different
branding
,
sub-imprint
and
business
practices
-
some
more
popular
and
successful
than
others
.

The
first
-
and
only
-
"
crossover
"
between
Vertigo
titles
,
0000-0
's
The
Children
's
Crusade
event
,
despite
comparable
preorder
numbers
of
the
higher
-
(
double
-
)
priced
Annuals
,
"
did
not
yield
smashing
results
"
or
garner
many
positive
reviews
,
in
large
part
due
to
its
"
gimmicky
"
nature
,
which
ran
counter
to
Vertigo
's
quirky
,
non-mainstream
appeal
and
customer-base
.

The
event
was
defended
as
"
no
marketing
ploy
"
by
one
of
the
event
's
editors
,
Lou
Stathis
,
who
wrote
of
his
dislike
of
the
often
"
crass
manipulation
"
of
crossover
events
,
defending
The
Children
's
Crusade
as
having
come
not
from
marketing
,
but
the
writers
'
minds
,
and
therefore
being
"
story-driven
"
rather
than
manipulative
.

The
crossover
did
not
become
an
annual
event
,
however
-
indeed
,
annuals
linked
to
Vertigo
series
rarely
reappeared
since
this
event
.

Vertigo
Visions
Marked
on
the
right-hand

the

"

logo
,
the
six
(
to
date
)
one-shots
released
under
this
sub-imprint
have
little
in
common
other
than
introducing
formerly
(
and
,
indeed
,
still
)
DC-Universe
characters
into
the
Vertigo
line
.

All
six
characters
span
the
gap
between
the
universes
,
and
have
appeared
in
comics
from
both
imprints
.

Prez
Rickard
for
example
,
debuted
in
Prez
a
short-lived
early-0000s
series
by
Joe
Simon
,
(
who
also
co-created
Brother
Power
the
Geek
and
Captain
America
)
and
artist
Jerry
Grandenetti
,
but
then
drifted
in
obscurity
before
being
spotlighted
in
Gaiman
's
Sandman
#

.

Ed
Brubaker
's
one-shot
dealt
with
Prez
's
supposed
son
seeking
out
his
supposed
father
.

Vertigo
Visions
was
also
the
title
of
a
0000
collection
of
artwork
from
various
Vertigo
titles
.

Vertigo
Voices
The
Vertigo
Voices
sub-imprint
was
an
early
attempt
by
Vertigo
to
allow
its
creators
freedom
in
producing
creator-owned
"
distinctive
one-shot
stories
.
"

Under
a
specially
designed
issue-header
(
along
the
top
,
rather
than
the
normal
Vertigo
side-banner
)
,
the
Vertigo
Voices
specials
were
owned
by
their
creators
,
and
released
as
an
initial
three
(
or
four
:
see
below
)
,
with
The
Eaters
following
separately
.

(
Tainted
was
to
be
"
the
third
of
the
three
original
...
specials
,
"
but
became
the
second
after
Kill
Your
Boyfriend
was
delayed
.
)

The
published
four
were
:
Milligan
and
Fegredo
's
Face
was
a
horror
story
involving
plastic
surgery
,
while
Delano
and
Davison
's
Tainted
-
described
by
one
fan/critic
as
a
"
psychological
masterpiece
"
-
was
a
Kafkaesque
tale
set
in
England
about
a
straight-laced
gentlemen
turned
peeping
tom
,
caught
up
in
a
tale
involving
repressed
memories
,
blackmail
and
murder
.

Grant
Morrison
and
Philip
Bond
's
Kill
Your
Boyfriend
deals
with
themes
of
repression
,
excess
and
corruptive
influences
,
and
purports
to
transform
a
"
real
"
character
into
a
mythical
one
by
having
the
main
female
take
on
the
persona
projected
by
her
new
,
murderous
,
bad-boy
boyfriend
-
a
transformation
she
uses
within
the
confines
of
the
story
to
justify
,
excuse
and
explain
her
excessive
behaviour
.

Peter
Milligan
and
Dean
Ormston
's
The
Eaters
was
a
black
comedy
dealing
with
a
family
of
cannibal
s
caught
up
in
a
tale
of
revenge
and
American
"
family
values
"
on
a
deeply
satirical
road
trip
.

Kill
Your
Boyfriend
was
later
reprinted
in
the
prestige
format
(
this
time
with
a
notable
spine
)
in
0000
.

Four
titles
were
initially
solicited
in
the
Vertigo
Voices
range
,
the
three
which
formed
the
initial
release
and
a
fourth
title
:
Bizarre
Boys
.

Announced
as
part
of
the
initial
line-up
,
but
subsequently
not
released
(
and
then
replaced
by
The
Eaters
)
,
Bizarre
Boys
was
to
have
been
a
collaboration
between
Grant
Morrison
,
Peter
Milligan
and
Jamie
Hewlett
.

This
title
would
have
seen
metafictional
authors
"
Morrigan
"
and
"
Millison
"
on
a
quest
to
find
their
titular
creations
,
and
"
[

James

Vertigo
Vérité
In
0000
,
several
comics
titles
(
two
one-shots
and
three
miniseries
)
were
collectively
released
under
the
sub-imprint
Vertigo
Vérité
.

The
short-lived
"
Vérité
"
line
,
evoking
the
realism
of
Cinéma
vérité
from
the
French
for
'
truth
,
'
"
was
a
0000
–
00
attempt
to
promote
new
Vertigo
projects
devoid
of
the
supernatural
qualities
that
had
gotten
to
define
the
publisher
.
"

The
five
titles
released
under
the
"
Vérité
"
baner
were
:
Seven
Miles
a
Second
(
the
title
comes
from
"
the
speed
which
an
object
needs
to
achieve
to
break
free
of
the
Earth
's
gravity
"
)
was
published
after
Wojnarowicz
'
death
from
AIDS
,
and
covered
his
experiences
of
living
with
that
disease
.

Peter
Kuper
's
The
System
dealt
wordlessly
with
"
class
warfare
in
the
big
city
,
"
while
Milligan
&
Fegredo
's
Girl
is
a
hyper-realistic
tale
of
a
disaffected
teenage
girl
prone
to
"
all-consuming
daydreams
...
needed
to
cope
with
life
itself
"
caught
up
in
a
tale
of
murder
and
mundanity
.

The
Unseen
Hand
features
a
college
student
caught
up
in
an
Illuminati
-
like
conspiracy
,
with
0000
's
Hell
Eternal
.

The
System
was
subsequently
collected
in
a
TPB
.

V0K
On
the
eve
of
the
year
0000
,
Vertigo
released
several
titles
under
the
"
Fifth-week
event
"
brand
V0K
(
Vertigo
0000
)
,
to
"
celebrate
...
the
(
faux
)
millennium
"
.

Fifth-week
events
,
which
infrequently
take
advantage
of
a
month
having
five
comics-shipping-days
(
usually
Wednesday/Thursday
)
are
typically
designed
to
fill-in
the
extra
day
in
the
normal
four
weekly
schedule
.

The
"
events
"
tend
to
see
the
released
of
stand
alone
one-shot
titles
,
usually
with
a
cogent
theme
.

V0K
,
by
contrast
was
a
"
much
hyped
concept
"
whose
titles
were
designed
to
"
usher
...
in
the
new
millennium
,
"
and
as
such
several
of
them
were
miniseries
rather
than
one-shots
.

Under
the
slogan
"
Future
's
Here
...
Start
Screaming
"
,
the
five
V0K
titles
were
:
Pulp
Fantastic
was
initially
solicited
(
and
the
first
issue
labelled
)
as
a
four-issue
miniseries
,
but
it
was
swiftly
revised
as
a
three-issue
mini
.

The
Vertigo
Pop
miniseries
were
designed
"
to
be
about
pop
culture
around
the
globe
in
some
vaguely
defined
way
.
"

Indeed
,
along
with
middling
sales-figures
,
one
critic
noted
that
"
[
a
]
side
from
vague
notions
of
foreign
cities
and
pop
culture
,
it
was
never
entirely
clear
what
they
were
supposed
to
have
in
common
in
the
first
place
.
"

The
first
(
four-issue
)
miniseries
,
Vertigo
Pop
:
Tokyo
was
in
the
words
of
one
reviewer
"
a
broad
comedy
about
cosplay
fans
and
the
mafia
(
yakuza
)
,
"
revolving
around
an
American
who
moves
to
Tokyo
's
famous
Akihabara
district
and
attempts
to
deal
with
the
differences
between
the
two
cultures
before
getting
caught
up
in
a
"
wild
adventure
involving
kidnapping
,
extortion
,
gangsters
,
and
rock
stars
.
"

The
second
miniseries
,
Vertigo
Pop
:
London
,
told
the
tale
of
"
Rocky
Lamont
,
lead
singer
in
0000s
rock
band
"
who
"
[
r
]
ather
than
burning
out
the
way
he
'd
hoped
...
[
went
]
into
a
slow
and
dull
decline
with
a
trophy
wife
and
a
series
of
dreary
albums
.
"

Given
the
chance
to
relive
his
life
by
switching
bodies
with
"
a
talentless
00
year-old
wannabe
rock
star
with
all
the
looks
and
charm
Rocky
used
to
have
,
"
the
series
deals
with
the
subsequent
soul-searching
and
reflection
over
such
a
decision
.

The
third
(
and
final
)
miniseries
,
Vertigo
Pop
:
Bangkok
was
an
altogether
"
darker
affair
,
"
dealing
in
part
with
the
sleazy
underbelly
of
Bangkok
from
the
perspective
of
a
number
of
different
Western
tourists
.

Featuring
several
unlikable
and
unsympathetic
protagonists
,
the
miniseries
"
capture
[
d
]
the
city
in
a
dirty
and
unflattering
—
yet
realistic
—
light
"
serving
as
a
backdrop
to
a
tale
of
the
Thai
sex
trade
and
sex
tourism
.

Also
highlighted

were
two
original
graphic
novels

Lovecraft
(
based
on
a
screenplay
by
Hans
Rodionoff
and
adapted
by
Keith
Giffen
with
art
by
Enrique
Breccia
)
took
the
conceit
that
H.
P.
Lovecraft
's
Cthulhu
mythos
creatures
were
real
,
to
paint
a
highly
fictionalized
biographic
portrait
of
the
titular
author
,
while
Howard
Chaykin
&
David
Tischman
's
Barnum
!

(
with
art
by
Niko
Henrichon
)
similarly
drifted
in
the
realms
of
fictionalized
biography
,
but
did
not
stray
into
the
horror/supernatural
world
.

The
tale
of
P.
T.
Barnum
:
secret
agent
saw
the
celebrated
showman
saving
the
life

was
cover-dated
July
0000
,
but
was
not
branded
a
"
Vertigo
X
"
title
.

Originally
previewed
as
a
"
Vertigo
X
"
title
,
Brett
Lewis
and
John
Paul
Leon
's
The
Winter
Men
was
ultimately
put
back
to
September
0000
,
when
it
was
released
-
under
the
WildStorm
Signature
Series
label
.

Vertigo
Crime
At
the
0000
Comic-Con
International
Karen
Berger
outlined
plans
for
a
new
"
sub-imprint
"
called
Vertigo
Crime
:
"
it
's
a
line
of
graphic
novels
,
in
black
and
white
,
hardcover
"
.

It
was
launched
in
0000
with
two
titles
:
Brian
Azzarello
's
Filthy
Rich
and
Ian
Rankin
's
Dark
Entries
,
the
latter
featuring
John
Constantine
.

Each
volume
features
a
cover
illustration
by
Lee
Bermejo
.

Vertigo
Crime
was
ended
as
a
sub-imprint
in
0000
.

The
following
original
graphic
novels
have
been
published
under
the
Vertigo
Crime
imprint
(
in
order
of
publication
)
:
Experimental
books
In
addition
to
the
various
sub-imprints
and
formats
,
Vertigo
was
also
an
early
adopter
of
hardcover
collections
of
monthly
comics
,
as
well
as
hardcover
OGNs
(
original
graphic
novels
)
.

In
addition
,
the
0000
one-shot
Vertical
featured
dimensions
unique
in
the
comics
field
.

Half
the
width
of
a
"
normal
"
comic
,
Vertical
was
also
stapled
at
the
top
making
it
"
twice
as
tall
.
"

The
dimensions
were
,
while
gimmicky
,
chosen
delibertely
to
complement
Steven
T.
Seagle
's
story
,
which
revolved
around
tall
buildings
and
,
of
course
,
feelings
of
"
Vertigo
.
"

(
N.B.
Vertical
was
not
the
first
comics
title
to
hinge
on
the
"
wrong
"
side
.

A
tried-and-tested
method
for
presenting
newspaper
comic
strips
,
the
0000
DC
Elseworlds
story
Batman
:
Nine
Lives
also
used
this
method
-
although
unlike
those
titles
,
Vertical
is
designed
to
be
read
vertically
,
and
not
horizontally
.
)

Neil
Gaiman
and
Charles
Vess
'
Stardust
was
released
by
Vertigo
as
a
heavily
illustrated
novel
,
rather
than
a
regular
comic
,
and
Vertigo
has
also
experimented
with
the
dimensions
of
their
OGNs
,
releasing
several
that
are
of
a
non-comic-book-standard
size
,
including
Dave
Gibbons
'
The
Originals
and
Mat
Johnson
's
Incognegro
(
which
also
featured
somewhat
experimental
artwork
,
namely
art
-
by
Warren
Pleece
-
that
was
fully
black
and
white
,
with
no
"
halftones
or
grays
"
)
.

Editors
In
addition
to
founding
editor
(
and
the
driving
force
behind
Vertigo
)
Karen
Berger
,
several
other
editors
have
become
intrinsically
linked
to
the
imprint
.

Berger
herself
was
editing
proto-Vertigo
titles
from
the
start
of
her
time
with
DC
,
beginning
in
0000
with
House
of
Mystery
.

She
took
over
editorship
of
Alan
Moore
's
Swamp
Thing
run
from
Swamp
Thing
co-creator
Len
Wein
in
0000
,
and
in
0000
"
became
DC
's
British
liaison
,
"
bringing
to
DC
's
pre-Vertigo
titles
the
individuals
who
would
be
instrumental
in
the
creation
and
evolution
of
Vertigo
seven
years
later
.

From
0000
,
her
Swamp
Thing
and
other
DC
titles
were
joined
by
Gaiman
and
McKean
's
Black
Orchid
miniseries
and
Hellblazer
as
well
as
the
odd
miniseries
The
Weird
.

Editing
Doug
Moench
's
The
Wanderers
,
Berger
was
joined
on
issue
#
0
(
Oct
0000
)
by
co-editor
Art
Young
,
who
would
also
later
be
instrumental
in
the
formation
of
Vertigo
.

Grant
Morrison
's
Animal
Man
and
the
ultra-dark
Arkham
Asylum
OGN
were
swiftly
joined
on
Berger
's
slate
by
The
Sandman
,
Skreemer
,
The
Books
of
Magic
,
The
Nazz
and
Shade
,
the
Changing
Man
.

Berger
continued
with
The
Sandman
and
Shade
during
0000
,
and
saw
the
pre-Vertigo
titles
as
"
all
[
having
]
some
basis
in
reality
.
"

By
the
early
0000s
,
"
[
t
]
he
core
Vertigo
titles
had
already
become
their
own
little
enclave
,
"
so
when
Berger
returned
from
maternity
leave
,
she
spoke
with
DC
President
Jenette
Kahn
and
Executive
Editor
Dick
Giordano
,
the
outcome
being
a
separate
imprint
to
"
actively
expand
[
the
]
sensibility
"
of
the
titles
she
had
been
editing
.

Berger
included
in
the
initial
Vertigo
line-up
the
five
titles
she
had
had
some
hand
in
creating
or
editing
(
Swamp
Thing
,
Hellblazer
,
Animal
Man
,
Sandman
and
Shade
)
as
well
as
Doom
Patrol
which
she
"
decided
to
include
...
because
Grant
Morrison
was
working
on
it
and
the
sensibility
was
very
much
like
the
other
series
.
"

Berger
has
since
overseen
the
entire
Vertigo
line
,
and
was
promoted
to
the
position
of
"
Senior
Vice
President
—
Executive
Editor
,
Vertigo
"
in
July
0000
.

Berger
's
promotion
came
as
Vertigo
was
said
to
be
equivalent
to
"
the
fourth
largest
American
comic
book
publisher
"
in
0000
,
with
Paul
Levitz
praising
her
personally
as
having
"
built
Vertigo
into
an
imprint
which
is
simultaneously
one
of
comics
'
leading
creative
and
commercial
successes
.
"

In
addition
,
Berger
won
Eisner
Awards
for
her
editing
in
0000
,
0000
and
0000
for
her
work
on
the
proto
-
and
early
Vertigo
titles
Sandman
,
Shade
,
Kid
Eternity
,
Books
of
Magic
,
Death
:
The
High
Cost
of
Living
and
Sandman
Mystery
Theatre
.

Art
Young
joined
Karen
Berger
to
edit
pre-Vertigo
issues
of
Animal
Man
(
from
issue
#
0
)
,
Hellblazer
and
Swamp
Thing
on
issues
cover-dated
November
0000
.

Two
months
later
,
Young
also
took
on
the
initial
issues
of
The
Sandman
,
before
in
mid-0000
moving
to
Doom
Patrol
,
which
with
Animal
Man
he
edited
until
early
0000
(
also
over-seeing
the
original
Books
of
Magic
miniseries
along
the
way
)
.

He
then
left
DC
to
work
for
Disney
in
setting
up
Touchmark
,
before
returning
with
those
projects
to
Vertigo
in
early
0000
,
when
he
edited
debut
title
Enigma
,
and
later
miniseries
and
one-shots
such
as
Sebastian
O
,
The
Extremist
,
Mercy
,
Rogan
Gosh
,
The
Mystery
Play
,
and
Tank

of
notable

during
her
(

Tom
Peyer
was
,
by
0000
editing
(
with
Karen
Berger
)
what
would
become
the
pillars
of
Vertigo
-
Hellblazer
,
Sandman
(
taking
over
from
Art
Young
)
,
Swamp
Thing
and
Shade
,

Writers
Although
the
"
mature
reader
"
works
of
Alan
Moore
,
Grant
Morrison
(
with
Jamie
Delano
and
Neil
Gaiman
)
under
the
DC
imprint
paved
the
way
for
Vertigo
's
launch
,
neither
author
was
part
of
the
initial
line-up
.

Indeed
,
Moore
never
produced
work
for
the
Vertigo
imprint
-
having
refused
to
work
for
parent
company
DC
in
the
late
0000s
-
although
his
DC-published
Swamp
Thing
work
and
V
for
Vendetta
reprint-maxiseries
were
subsequently
collected
as
Vertigo-issued
TPBs
,
while
the
Hellblazer
solo
title
dealt
with
the
character
co-created
by
Moore
,
but
never
written
by
him
.

Launch
writers
Grant
Morrison
,
whose
pre-Vertigo
work
on
Animal
Man
and
Doom
Patrol
was
similarly
retroactively
branded
as
"
Vertigo
"
when
collected
,
also
wrote
two
issues
of
Hellblazer
pre-Vertigo
,
which
are
collected
in
a
0000
trade
paperback
.

Wrote
three
volumes
of
The
Invisibles
between
0000
and
0000
.

In
addition
,
he
has
produced
a
number
of
miniseries
including
Sebastian
O
(
0000
)
,
the
Doom
Patrol
spin-off
Flex
Mentallo
(
0000
)
,
Seaguy
(
0000
)
,
Vimanarama
(
0000
)
,
We0
(
0000
–

)
and
"
Joe
The
Barbarian
"
(
0000
)
as
well
as
the
longer
miniseries
The
Filth
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

He
collaborated
with
writer
Mark
Millar
on
five
issues
of
Swamp
Thing
in
0000
,
produced
two
one-shots
—
The
Mystery
Play
(
0000
)
and
Kill
Your
Boyfriend
(
0000
)
—
and
contributed
to
several
anthologies
.

Of
the
eight
debut
Vertigo
titles
,
half
of
them
were
the
work
of
two
authors
.

Neil
Gaiman
,
who
went
on
to
become
a
New
York
Times
best-selling
novelist
,
came
to
prominence
four
years
pre-Vertigo
with
the
launch
of
The
Sandman
for
DC
Comics
,
a
title
that
became
the
backbone
of
the
initial
Vertigo
line-up
.

Gaiman
's
work
on
the
first
The
Books
of
Magic
miniseries
(
also
released
as
a
DC
title
,
0000
–
00
)
lay
the

Later
writers
John
Ney
Reiber
has
produced
most
of
his
output
for
Vertigo
,
working
exclusively
for
the
company
between

and
0000
.

Reiber
wrote
the
first
fifty
issues
of
the
first
ongoing
The
Books
of
Magic
series
(
May
00
-
July
00
)
,
as
well
as
a
number
of
miniseries
,
mostly
set
in
the
wider
Vertigo
universe
(

particularly
the

of
Magic
sections
)
-
Mythos

Trenchcoat
Brigade
(
0000
)
,
The
Books
of
Faerie
:
Molly
's
Story
(
0000
)
.

Reiber
's
Shadows
Fall
(
with
artist
John
Van
Fleet
)
was
a
self-created
horror
story
grounded
in
a
reality
which
made
the
tale
"
all
the
more
creepy
than
if
the
story
was
played
out
in
the
realm
and
scope
of
superheroes
.
"

Reiber
's
Tell
Me
Dark
,
produced
for
DC
,
was
collected
in
softcover
by
Vertigo
,
and
he
also
contributed
to
various
anthologies
.

J.
M.
DeMatteis
began
his
comics
career
on
DC
's
House
of
Mystery
title
over
a
decade
before
the
formation
of
Vertigo
,
and
later
became
one
of
the
earliest
Vertigo
creators
thanks
in
large
part
to
his
proposed
Touchmark
projects
.

DeMatteis
'
Mercy
(
0000
)
one-shot
and
miniseries
The
Last
One
both
debuted
in
0000
,
with
reprints
of
two
creator-owned
Epic
Comics
projects
following
in
subsequent
years
:
his
0000-0

Mike
Carey
,
having
started
his
American
comics
career
with
Caliber
Comics
in
the
mid-0000s
catapulted
to
prominence
in
March
0000
with
the
first
issue
of
his
Sandman
spin-off
miniseries
Sandman
Presents
:
Lucifer
,
which
would
lead
to
an
on-going
series
a
year
later
and
considerable
praise
and
projects
for
Carey
.

A
second
Sandman
miniseries
-
Sandman
Presents
:
Petrefax
(
0000
)
-
soon
followed
,
before
the
June
0000
debut
of
Lucifer
.

Neil
Gaiman
's
preferred
Sandman
spin-off
had
not
had
an
easy
time
being
published
,
due
to
its
title
and
main
character
,
but
Carey
was
able
to
helm
it
for
a
Sandman-equalling
00
issues
(
and
a
0000
one-shot
-
Nirvana
)
for
0
years
.

During
this
time
,
Carey
also
wrote
the
hardcover
OGN
Sandman
Presents
:
The
Furies
(
0000
)
,
over
00
issues
of
Hellblazer

Hellblazer
original
graphic
novel

)
and
the
miniseries

(

.

Brian
K.
Vaughan
's
first
Vertigo
work
was
a
short
story
in
0000
's
Winter
's
Edge
#

anthology
,
which
led
to
him
relaunching
Swamp
Thing

(
0000
–

which
lasted
for

Brubaker
's
first
Vertigo
work
was

the
"
Vertigo
Visions
"
Prez
one-shot
(
0000
)
,
and
intermittent
contributions
to
a
couple
of
anthology
titles
preceded
his
Scene
of
the
Crime
(
0000
)
,
effectively
laying
the
groundwork
for
his
later
crime
comics
.

His
next
Vertigo
project
-
the
post-apocalyptic
series
Deadenders
(
0000
–
00
)
-
ran
for
00

Batman
and
Detective
Comics
for
parent-company

His
0000
miniseries
Sandman
Presents
:
The
Dead
Boy
Detectives
told
the
story
of
some
incidental
Sandman
characters
,
and
was
later
retold
by
Jill
Thompson
in
manga
form
(
0000
)
.

Brubaker
subsequently
took
his
Vertigo/crime
sensibility
to
work
from
WildStorm
,
Icon
and
the
mainstream
DC
and
Marvel
universes
.

Bill
Willingham
came
to
Vertigo
after
a
plethora
of
small
press
work
in
0000
to
launch
his
poker
miniseries
Proposition
Player
(
0000

D.R.E.A.M.
(

and
a
single

.

A
second
Sandman
one-shot
-
The
Sandman
Presents
:
Everything
You
Always
Wanted
to
Know
About
Dreams
...
(
0000
)
-
also
led
to
a
0-issue
miniseries
,
Sandman
Presents
:
The
Thessaliad
(
0000
)
.

Willingham
's
best-known
work
soon
followed
,
with
the
July
0000
debut
of
Fables
(
with
artist
Lan
Medina
)
.

In
0000
,
he
returned
to
the
world
of
the
Sandman
with
Sandman
Presents
:
Thessaly
:
Witch
for
Hire
,
and
0000
saw
the
debut
of
the
Vertigo-esque
magical
-
but
mainstream
DCU
title
-
Shadowpact
and
Fables
companion
series
Jack

Fables
.

In
July
0000
,
with

a
major
turning
point
in
its
run
,
Willingham
relaunched
House
of
Mystery
as
a

Artists
Several
artists
have
also
produced
a
large
amount
of
notable
work
for
Vertigo
,
several
(
Steve
Dillon
,
Pia
Guerra
,
Eduardo
Risso
and
Darick
Robertson
)
mainly
producing
lengthy
runs
on
individual
creator-owned
titles
(
in
Guerra
's
case
,
Y
:
The
Last
Man
makes
up
around
00
%
of
her
output
to
date
)
,
but
others
on
a
number
of
titles
.

Vertigo
's
main
Universe
titles
-
The
Sandman
,
Hellblazer
and
Swamp
Thing
-
have
been
particularly
artistically
diverse
,
and
home
to
many
talents
,
while
the
large
number
of
creator-owned
miniseries
has
seen
large
numbers
of
individuals
producing
work
for
Vertigo
.

Peter
Gross
worked
on
a
pre-Vertigo
issue
of
Swamp
Thing
and
an
early
Vertigo
issue
of
Shade
the
Changing
Man
(
#
00
,
June
0000
)
before
penciling
&
inking
a
story
featuring
Timothy
Hunter
in
the
"
Children
's
Crusade
"
crossover
Arcana
Annual
(
Jan.
0000
)
.

This
led
to
a
regular
inking
role
on
the
newly
launched
Books
of
Magic
series
,
taking
over
as
regular
penciler
and
inker

he
would
stay

its
run
,
writing
as
well
as
drawing
its
final
00
issues
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

Gross
also
inked
Reiber
's
Mythos

and
several
issues
of
Douglas
Rushkoff
's
Testament
from
0000
to
0000
.

Dean
Ormston
has
similarly
produced
a
disproportionate
amount
of
his
artwork
for
Vertigo
titles
,
including
the
lion
's
share
of
the
alternate
reality
Books
of
Magick
:
Life

Wartime
series
(

he
penciled
and
inked

Duncan
Fegredo

first
major
American

was
on
the
0000
Kid
Eternity
miniseries
with
Grant
Morrison
.

A
0000
cover
for
Doom

similarly
fell
in
Vertigo
territory
pre-Vertigo
,
while
Fegredo
's
first
"
true
"
Vertigo
work
was
also
on
the
joint-first
new
