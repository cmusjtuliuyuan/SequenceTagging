"
Shall

be
amended
to
add
a
Community
Bill
of

rights

a

energy
future

prohibiting

from
installing
pipelines

compressor
stations

development

Opponents
to
the
measure
stated
that
it
would
have
several
negative
consequences
.

These
consequences
included
:
Taking
away
residents
’
property
(
mineral
rights
)
without
due
process
and
without
compensation
for
those
rights
;
Limiting
transportation

goods

delivery
systems
such
as
natural
gas
lines
and
other
fossil
fuels
used
to
supply
fuel
to
heat
homes
,
operate
businesses
;
and
it
would
raise
Township
taxes
or
reduce
services
due
to
lawsuits
against
the
Township
that
would
potentially
follow

History
Park
Forest
Village
,
created
in
0000
,
was
the
first
large
suburban
development
near
State
College
.

This
neighborhood
won
several
national
awards
for
its
design
,
which
moved
away
from
the
straight
streets
and
clear
cutting
typical
of
post
World
War
II
suburban
developments
.

The
use
of
gracefully
curved
streets
and
the
retention
of
trees
established
a
pattern
for
future
developments
everywhere
.

Geography
Park
Forest
Village
is
located
at
(
00.000000

.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
CDP
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

The
subdivision
was
developed
on
0,000
acres
of
land
know
as
part
of
the
Barrens
in
Patton
Township
by
J.
Alvin
Hawbaker
,
a
well
known
real
estate
developer
in
State
College
,
PA.
.

Through
his
company
,
Park
Forest
Enterprises
,
he
created
the
cul
de
sac
and
curved
streets
design
of
Park
Forest
Village
which
ended
up
yielding
more
housing
units
per
square
mile
than
the
conventional
city
grid
pattern
.

Park
Forest
Village
also
utilized
several
localized
parks
so
that
common
recreation
areas
would
be
accessible
to
each
neighborhood
in
the
subdivision
.

The
landscaping
of
each
homesite
also
retained
as
many
native
trees
on
the
original
land
as
possible
,
giving
each
property
abundant
trees
and
a
mature
,
long-term
,
lived
in
look
as
opposed
to
young
sapling
trees
planted
at
the
time
most
conventional
homes
were
constructed
that
took
years
to
grow
and
mature
.

As
the
building
of
the
subdivision
progressed
,
utility
lines
were
buried
so
that
telephone
and
power
line
poles
became
unnecessary
,
giving
the
streets
a
cleaner
design
and
look
.

J.
Alvin
Hawbaker
also
pioneered
the
"
Gallery
of
Homes
"
real
estate
marketing
approach
,
which
resulted
in
the
sale
of
thousands
of
housing
units
within
the
area
now
known
as
Park
Forest
Village
.

"

Happy
Valley
"
is
another
often-used
term
to
refer
to
the
State
College
area
,
including
the
borough
and
the
townships
of
College
,
Harris
,
Patton
,
and
Ferguson
.

In
0000
,
State
College
was
ranked
as
the
third-safest
metropolitan
area
in
the
United
States
by
the
CQ
Press
.

In
0000
,
it
was
ranked
third
best
college
town
in
the
United
States
by
the
American
Institute
for
Economic
Research
.

History
State
College
evolved
from
village
to
town
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
fledgling
Pennsylvania
State
College
,
founded
as
the
Farmers
'
High
School
of
Pennsylvania
in
0000
.

State
College
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
August
00
,
0000
and
has
since
grown
with
the
college
,
which
in
0000
was
renamed
The
Pennsylvania
State
University
.

In
0000
State
College
adopted
a
home
rule
charter
which
took
effect
in
0000
;
since
that
time
,
it
has
not
been
governed
by
the
state
's
Borough
Code
,
although
it
retains
"
Borough
of
State
College
"
as
its
official
name
.

The
university
has
a
post
office
address
of
University
Park
,
Pennsylvania
.

When
Penn
State
changed
its
name
from
College
to
University
in
0000
,
its
president
,
Milton
S.
Eisenhower
,
sought
to
persuade
the
town
to
change
its
name
as
well
.

A
referendum
failed
to
yield
a
majority
for
any
of
the
choices
for
a
new
name
,
and
so
the
town
remains
State
College
.

After
this
,
Penn
State
requested
a
new
name
for
its
on-campus
post
office
in
the
HUB
–
Robeson
Center
from
the
U.S.
Post
Office
Department
.

The
post
office
,
which
has
since
moved
across
a
street
to
the
McAllister
Building
,
is
the
official
home
of
zip
code

Atglen
is
a
borough
in
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
land
upon
which
Atglen
now
stands
was
once
a
wilderness
.

Cutting
through
it
were
paths
made
by
Indians
who
traveled
from
Paxtang
(
present
day
Harrisburg
)
to
present
day
Newcastle
,
Delaware
to
trade
with
the
Swedes
and
later
,
the
English
.

The
great
Minquas
path
was
one
of
them
.

Enterprising
businessmen
grew
bolder
in
their
desire
to
stimulate
business
so
they
began
to
travel
to
the
Indian
's
own
homes
.

There
were
even
some
French
men
in
the
area
who
traded
with
the
Indian
,
as
did
the
English
.

Stories
have
come
down
to
us
that
at
the
Greenwood
Forge
location
,
Indians
slept
by
the
fireplace
of
Andrew
Moore
's
home
,
which
was
built
after
he
came
to
America
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Sadsbury
township
was
organized
.

It
included
all
of
present
day
Sadsbury
Township
as
well
as
Fallowfield
,
Highland
,
and
Valley
townships
.

In
August
0000
,
several
inhabitants
petitioned
the
court
to
separate
Sadsbury
from
Fallowfield
because
of
the
former
's
size
.

In
November
,
0000
,
the
township
was
subdivided
into
East
and
West
Sadsbury
,
and
in
0000
,
upon
the
division
of
Chester
County
into
Lancaster
and
Chester
counties
,
the
line
between
the
two
divisions
of
the
township
was
made
to
conform
to
the
county
line
.

During
the
mid
00th
century
,
more
and
more
settlers
arrived
,
drawn
by
the
rich
farming
land
that
is
located
here
.

The
Indian
trails
became
horse
tracks
and
later
wagon
tracks
as
farmers
shipped
their
goods
to
market
in
Philadelphia
and
Newport
or
New
Castle
,
Delaware
.

The
old
Provincial
Highway
as
authorized
by
the
government
was
laid
out
in
0000
and
the
Newport
Rood
to
the
ore
mines
at
Cornwall
,
Lebanon
County
,
was
laid
out
in
0000
.

Roads
sprang
up
from
these
wagon
tracks
—
the
Lancaster-Philadelphia
road
,
(
It
became
a
turnpike
after
0000
)
and
the
Strasburg
Road
.

The
road
to
Newcastle
was
turnpiked
in
0000
.

Settlers
came
from
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
to
live
in
this
province
of
Pennsylvania
where
freedom
of
religion
had
been
guaranteed
by
its
founder
,
William
Penn.
.

The
earliest
organized
religious
group
were
the
Presbyterians
,
who
in
0000
formed
what
we
know
today
as
the
Upper
Octorara
Presbyterian
Church
.

They
were
followed
by
the
Quakers
who
in
0000
founded
the
Sadsbury
Meeting
House
.

A
year
later
,
the
English
settlers
formed
their
church
at
St.
John
's
Church
,
Pequea
,
at
Compass
.

Andrew
Moore
(
0000-0000
)
,
who
had
been
influential
with
Samuel
Miller
in
founding
Sadsbury
Meeting
House
,
built
a
tub
mill
on
his
property
and
usage
by
the
settlers
in
this
area
.

Many
older
residents
will
remember
the
old
Moore
Mill
as
Chalfanat
's
Paper
Mill
seventy
years
ago
.

Andrew
Moore
's
son
,
James
,
also
had
a
grain
mill
powered
by
water
from
the
east
branch
of
the
Octorara
Creek
.

The
earliest
settlers
in
the
vicinity
of
Atglen
appear
to
have
been
the
Philips
and
the
Moores
.

The
former
owning
much
of
the
valley
upon
which
the
borough
of
Atglen
now
stands
,
and
the
latter
the
hilly

north

County
,
Pennsylvania

.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Coatesville
is
approximately
00
miles
west
of
Philadelphia
.

Coatesville
grew
up
around
the
Lukens
Steel
Company
.

Lukens
was
bought
by
the
Bethlehem
Steel
Corporation
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Bethlehem
was
bought
by
the
then
Ohio-based
International
Steel
Group
(
ISG
)

History
Beginnings
The
first
known
settlement
in
the
area
which
would
be
known
as
Coatesville
was
a
Native
American
village
built
along
the
West
Branch
of
the
Brandywine
River
.

This
settlement
was
a
post
for
fur
trading
with
the
earliest
American
settlers
.

The
Brandywine
River
features
prominently
in
the
history
of
Coatesville
.

William
Fleming
,
originally
from
Scotland
,
is
one
of
the
earliest
landowners
on
record
.

He
built
a
log
cabin
in
the
area
of
Harmony
Street
and
0th
Avenue
and
owned
about
of
land
bordering
the
Brandywine
River
.

Moses
Coates
,
a
prosperous
farmer
and
the
namesake
of
Coatesville
,
bought
the
Fleming
house
from
Fleming
's
son
in
0000
.

Moses
Coates
'
son-in-law
,
Jesse
Kersey
,
came
up
with
a
plan
to
develop
the
area
by
selling
frontage
on
the
recently
completed
Lancaster
Turnpike
which
crossed
through
their
land
.

The
Lancaster
Turnpike
was
the
first
toll
road
in
the
U.S.
,
authorized
in
0000
and
completed
in
0000
.

There
was
a
tollgate
located
within
the
present
day
Coatesville
city
limits
.

Coatesville
became
a
popular
stopping
point
since
it
was
located
roughly
halfway
between
Philadelphia
and
Lancaster
on
the
Turnpike
.

Another
of
the
earliest
settlers
in
the
Coatesville
region
was
Pierre
Bizallion
.

He
was
a
French
fur
trader
who
settled
in
the
area
in
the
early
00th
century
,
and
was
said
to
have
been
an
interpreter
between
William
Penn
and
the
Native
Americans
.

The
Veterans
Administration
Hospital
now
sits
on
a
piece
of
the
roughly
of
land
that
was
once
owned
by
Bizallion
.

00th
century
Before
Coatesville
became
the
only
city
in
Chester
County
,
it
was
a
town
called
Bridge-Town
,
because
of
the
two
bridges
that
were
used
to
cross
the
Brandywine
River
.

A
village
named
"
Midway
"
,
named
after
its
station
owned
by
the
Philadelphia
and
Columbia
Railroad
midway
between
Philadelphia
and
Lancaster
,
was
also
formed
in
0000
on
the
western
bank
of
the
Brandywine
.

The
village
of
Midway
and
the
village
of
Bridge-Town
merged
to
become
the
borough
of
Coatesville
in
0000
.

Coatesville
citizens
voted
to
become
a
city
in
0000
.

Coatesville
was
able
to
capitalize
on
the
natural
energy
available
due
to
the
Brandywine
River
running
through
the
area
.

Jesse
Kersey
,
Moses
Coates
'
son-in-law
,
partnered
with
the
ironmaster
Isaac
Pennock
and
purchased
over
of
Moses
Coates
'
farm
along
both
sides
of
the
Brandywine
River
in
0000
.

The
resulting
company
was
named
the
Brandywine
Iron
Works
and
Nail
Factory
,
the
forerunner
of
Lukens
Steel
.

Charles
Lukens
,
MD
,
married
Isaac
Pennock
's
daughter
Rebecca
in
0000
.

Following
her
husband
's
death
in
0000
,
Rebecca
Lukens
took
over
the
operations
of
the
mill
,
purchasing
it
from
her
mother
and
seeing
it
through
turmoil
and
market
panic
into
a
prosperous
mill
.

Rebecca
was
one
of
the
first
female
operators
of
a
major
corporation
in
America
.

00th
century
As
Lukens
Steel
grew
so
did
Coatesville
,
eventually
becoming
known
as
the
"
Pittsburgh
of
the
East
.
"

By
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
the
population
had
grown
to
0,000
.

Along
with
the
growth
,
the
school
system
expanded
as
well
as
the
religious
community
.

In
0000
Coatesville
was
the
home
to
00
churches
and
Chester
County
's
only
synagogue
,
Beth
Israel
Congregation
.

Lukens
Steel
was
the
largest
employer
in
Chester
County
in
the
0000s
,
with
over
00,000
workers
.

After
World
War
II
the
steel
industry
began
a
long
decline
and
Lukens
Steel
was
eventually
sold
again
and
again
,
forcing
workplace
reductions
to
0,000
and
eventually
to
0,000
.

In
0000
,
the
lynching
in
Coatesville
of
Zachariah
Walker
,
a
black
man
who
allegedly
killed
a
white
mill
policeman
Edgar
Rice
,
prompted
the
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
(
NAACP
)
to
investigate
and
called
for
an
end
to
lynching
nationwide
.

Walker
was
dragged
from
a
hospital
,
still
chained
to
his
bedstead
,
and
burned
to
death
in
front
of
hundreds
of
Coatesville
citizens
in
a
field
south
of
the
city
.

When
Walker
staggered
from
the
pyre
,
a
mass
of
flames
,
with
rakes
and
pitchforks
the
citizens
of
Coatesville
shoved
him
back
in
.

The
lynching
was
the
last
in
Pennsylvania
and
is
said
to
have
left
a
permanent
stain
on
the
city
's
image
.

00st
century
Coatesville
recently
began
an
ambitious
redevelopment
project
which
include
tearing
down
abandoned
and
dangerous
public
housing
,
building
new
single
family
and
townhouse
developments
,
a
regional
recreation
center
,
and
most
recently
,
mixed
use
projects
that
would
include
retail
,
office
,
and
condominium
housing
,
as
well
as
the
renovation
of
the
local
Amtrak
station
which
has
fallen
into
disrepair
.

A
new
Marriott
hotel
built
along
Route
00
on
the
outskirts
of
Coatesville
opened
May
0000
.

The
redevelopment
plans
have
not
been
without
controversy
,
including
a
five-year
eminent
domain
dispute
with
a
local
landowner
in
neighboring
Valley
Township
.

It
has
been
resolved
without
the
need
to
seize
the
property
,
but
it
caused
the
ouster
of
four
incumbent
city
councilpersons
in
the
November
0000
general
elections
.

The
four
new
councilpersons
,
two
of
whom
are
ordained
Pentecostal
and
Methodist
ministers
,
caused
further
controversy
with
the
firing
of
the
city
solicitor
,
the
resignation
of
the
city
manager
(
who
negotiated
with
the
Valley
Township
landowner
)
,
and
the
departure
of
the
assistant
manager
,
police
chief
,
and
city
treasurer
.

A
series
of
arsons
took
place
in
the
city
from
0000
to
early
0000
.

A
December
0000
fire
at
a
Strode
Avenue
home
resulted
in
the
death
of
00-year-old
World
War
II
Holocaust
survivor
Irene
Kempest
.

Another
fire
the
following
month
on
the
000
block
of
Fleetwood
Street
burned
00
row
houses
,
causing
$
0
million
in
damage
and
leaving
dozens
homeless
.

By
March
0000
,
police
had
arrested
six
suspects
in
the
fires
.

On
June
0
,
0000
one
man
,
pleading
no-contest
due
to
mental
illness
,
was
sentenced
to
a
00-year
prison
sentence
for
five
of
the
fires
,
one
of
which
resulted
in
Kempest
's
death
.

Another
,
who
plead
guilty
to
the
Fleetwood
Street
fire
and
eight
others
,
received
a
sentence
of
00.0
to
00
years
with
order
to
pay
$
0.0
million
in
restitution
.

Twenty
of
the
nearly
00
fires
over
the
two-year
span
remain
unsolved
.

In
0000
Lukens
Steel
forged
steel
beams
for
the
World
Trade
Center
in
New
York
City
.

Some
of
these
beams
,
known
as
"

"
,
remained
standing
after
the

.

Ten

the

Downingtown
is
a
borough
in

Pennsylvania
,
west
of
Philadelphia
.

As
of
the
0000
census
it
had
a
population
of
0,000
.

Downingtown
was
settled
by
English
and
European
colonists
in
the
early
00th
century
and
has
a
number
of
historic
buildings
and
structures
.

History
The
town
was
originally
named
Milltown
due
to
its
number
of
mills
along
the
East
Branch
Brandywine
Creek
,
the
first
of
which
was
founded
by
Daniel
Butter
.

The
Butter
family
also
had
paper
mills
in
the
area
,
and
Frederick
Bicking
from
Winterburg
,
Germany
,
was
the
patriarch
of
the
Bicking
paper
families
.

Around
the
time
of
the
American
Revolution
,
Milltown
became
more
commonly
known
as
Downingtown
after
the
prominent
businessman
Thomas
Downing
,
a
Quaker
immigrant
in
0000
from
Bradninch
,
Devon
,
England
,
who
owned
a
number
of
those
mills
.

The
town
was
officially
named
Downingtown
in
0000
.

The
town
is
located
along
the
Lincoln
Highway
(
now
part
of
U.S.
Route
00
)
which
runs
from
the
East
Coast
to
the
West
Coast
.

It
was
an
early
westward
road
in
the
wagon
days
as
the
Philadelphia
and
Lancaster
Turnpike
.

The
Lincoln
Highway
was
the
first
paved
road
to
cross
the
nation
from
the
Atlantic
to
the
Pacific
.

Construction
of
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
started
in
the
early
0000s
and
was
completed
in
the
early
0000s
;
it
runs
north
of
US
00
,
bypassing
Downingtown
.

About
0000
Sami
Warren
built
what
has
become
known
as
the
Downingtown
Log
House
.

In
0000
the
next
owner
Hickman
sold
the
0
½
story
,
00
'
0
"
×
00
'
structure
to
Thomas
and
Mary
Moore
.

Thomas
Moore
moved
from
the
Log
House
in
0000
and
died
in
0000
.

Thomas
Downing
acquired
the
Log
House
in
0000
.

It
remained
in
the
Downing
family
until
0000
,
when
Thomas
W.
Downing
died
and
left
it
to
the
borough
of
Downingtown
.

The
borough
did
some
restoration
work
to
the
Downingtown
Log
House
in
0000
.

It
served
as
the
home
to
the
Downingtown
Chamber
of
Commerce
from
0000
until
0000
.

But
the
Log
House
was
deteriorating
as
Route
00
had
been
built
close
to
it
.

Located
below
street
level
,
the
house
suffered
water
damage
due
to
runoff
from
Route
00
and
vibration
from
traffic
weakened
the
structure
.

From
0000
until
0000
the
Downingtown
Historical
Society
relocated
the
house
and
did
an
extensive
restoration
with
money
raised
for
the
project
.

It
now
sits
approximately
west
of
its
original
location
,
from
the
Route
00
sidewalk
,
and
slightly
above
street
level
.

on
a
000-acre

both
served
as

An
extranet
is
a
computer
network
that
allows
controlled
access
from
the
outside
,
for
specific
business
or
educational
purposes
.

In
a
business-to-business
context
,
an
extranet
can
be
viewed
as
an
extension
of
an
organization
's
intranet
that
is
extended
to
users
outside
the
organization
,
usually
partners
,
vendors
,
and
suppliers
,
in
isolation
from
all
other
Internet
users
.

In
contrast
,
business-to-consumer
(
B0C
)
models
involve
known
servers
of
one
or
more
companies
,
communicating
with
previously
unknown
consumer
users
.

An
extranet
is
similar
to
a
DMZ
in
that
it
provides
access
to
needed
services
for
channel
partners
,
without
granting
access
to
an
organization
's
entire
network
.

Relationship
to
an
intranet
An
extranet
can
be
understood
as
an
intranet
mapped
onto
the
public
Internet
or
some
other
transmission
system
not
accessible
to
the
general
public
,
but
managed
by
more
than
one
company
's
administrator
(
s
)
.

For
example
,
military
networks
of
different
security
levels
may
map
onto
a
common
military
radio
transmission
system
that
never
connects
to
the
Internet
.

Any
private
network
mapped
onto
a
public
one
is
a
virtual
private
network
(
VPN
)
,
often
using
special
security
protocols
.

For
decades
,
institutions
have
been
interconnecting
to
each
other
to
create
private
networks
for
sharing
information
.

One
of
the
differences
that
characterizes
an
extranet
,
however
,
is
that
its
interconnections
are
over
a
shared
network
rather
than
through
dedicated
physical
lines
.

With
respect
to
Internet
Protocol
networks
,
RFC
0000
states
"
If
all
the
sites
in
a
VPN
are
owned
by
the
same
enterprise
,
the
VPN
is
a
corporate
intranet
.

If
the
various
sites
in
a
VPN
are
owned
by
different
enterprises
,
the
VPN
is
an
extranet
.

A
site
can
be
in
more
than
one
VPN
;
e.g.
,
in
an
intranet
and
several
extranets
.

We
regard
both
intranets
and
extranets
as
VPNs
.

In
general
,
when
we
use
the
term
VPN
we
will
not
be
distinguishing
between
intranets
and
extranets
.

Even
if
this
argument
is
valid
,
the
term
"
extranet
"
is
still
applied
and
can
be
used
to
eliminate
the
use
of
the
above
description
.
"

[
0
]
In
the
quote
above
from
RFC
0000
,
the
term
"
site
"
refers
to
a
distinct
networked
environment
.

Two
sites
connected
to
each
other
across
the
public
Internet
backbone
comprise
a
VPN
.

The
term
"
site
"
does
not
mean
"
website
.
"

Thus
,
a
small
company
in
a
single
building
can
have
an
"
intranet
,
"
but
to
have
a
VPN
,
they
would
need
to
provide
tunneled
access
to
that
network
for
geographically
distributed
employees
.

Similarly
,
for
smaller
,
geographically
united
organizations
,
"
extranet
"
is
a
useful
term
to
describe
selective
access
to
intranet
systems
granted
to
suppliers
,
customers
,
or
other
companies
.

Such
access
does
not
involve
tunneling
,
but
rather
simply
an
authentication
mechanism
to
a
web
server
.

In
this
sense
,
an
"
extranet
"
designates
the
"
private
part
"
of
a
website
,
where
"
registered
users
"
can
navigate
,
enabled
by
authentication
mechanisms
on
a
"
login
page
"
.

An
extranet
requires
network
security
.

These
can
include
firewalls
,
server
management
,
the
issuance
and
use
of
digital
certificates
or
similar
means
of
user
authentication
,
encryption
of
messages
,
and
the
use
of
virtual
private
networks
(
VPNs
)
that
tunnel
through
the
public
network
.

Many
technical
specifications
describe
methods
of
implementing
extranets
,
but
often
never
explicitly
define
an
extranet
.

RFC
0000
presents
requirements
for
remote
access
to
extranets
.

RFC
0000
discusses
extranet
implementation
using
IPsec
and
advanced
network
address
translation
(
NAT
)
.

Enterprise
applications
During
the
late
0000s
and
early
0000s
,
several
industries
started
to
use
the
term
'
extranet
'
to
describe
centralized
repositories
of
shared
data
(
and
supporting
applications
)
made
accessible
via
the
web
only
to
authorized
members
of
particular
work
groups
-
for
example
,
geographically
dispersed
,
multi-company
project
teams
.

Some
applications
are
offered
on
a
software
as
a
service
(
SaaS
)
basis
.

For
example
,
in
the
construction
industry
,
project
teams
may
access
a
project
extranet
to
share
drawings
,
photographs
and
documents
,
and
use
online
applications
to
mark-up
and
make
comments
and
to
manage
and
report
on
project-related
communications
.

In
0000
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
several
of
the
leading
vendors
formed
the
Network
for
Construction
Collaboration
Technology
Providers
(
NCCTP
)
to
promote
the
technologies
and
to
establish
data
exchange
standards
between
the
different
data
systems
.

The
same
type
of
construction-focused
technologies
have
also
been
developed
in
the
United
States
,
Australia
and
mainland
Europe
.

Specially
secured
extranets
are
used
to
provide
virtual
data
room
services
to
help
manage
transactions
between
companies
in
sectors
such
as
law
and
accountancy
.

East
Pikeland
Township
is
a
township
in
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Pike
's
Land
was
the
first
name
given
to
a
grant
of
by
William
Penn
to
Joseph
Pike
from
County
Cork
,
Ireland
,
in
0000
.

It
was
eventually
sold
by
Pike
's
descendants
and
in
0000
was
split
in
two
parts
,
East
Pikeland
and
West
Pikeland
.

Mr.
E.
Kimber
established
the
French
Creek
Boarding
School
for
Girls
in
the
0000s
and
gave
his
name
to
the
Village
of
Kimberton
.

East
Pikeland
today
retains
over
000
historically
significant
structures
and
sites
.

Those
located
in
the
historic
Kimberton
Village
are
the
Kimberton
Inn
,
the
girls
'
school
,
Chrisman
's
Mill
(
now
the
Kimberton
Post
Office
)
,
the
Kimberton
Train
Station
and
Pennypackers
Mill
.

The
Zion
Lutheran
Church
on
Route
000
holds
the
distinction
of
being
the
second
oldest
Lutheran
Church
in
the
United
States
;
and
the
Rapps
Dam
Covered
Bridge
and
the
Silver
Bridge
iron
bridge
on
Hares
Hill
Road
both
have
historic
significance
.

East
Pikeland
was
directly
involved
in
the
Revolutionary
War
,
especially
from
0000
through
0000
,
and
most
heavily
during
the
"
Philadelphia
Campaign
"
in
0000
and
0000
.

It
was
a
source
of
provisions
for
the
Army
from
its
farms
,
mills
and
cottage
industries
.

Military
importance
came
in
0000
with
the
authorization
by
the
Committee
of
Safety
in
Philadelphia
from
the
Continental
Powder
Mill
,
and
the
site
chosen
was
at
Rapps
Dam
on
French
Creek
.

The
mill
was
a
key
element
in
a
system
of
munitions
supply
that
involved
the
Warwick
and
Reading
iron
furnaces
near
the
headwaters
of
French
Creek
,
which
together
with
other
furnaces
such
as
Hopewell
produced
cannon
and
ammunition
for
Washington
.

The
prime
location
of
the
mill
on
the
creek
with
its
long
millrace
was
not
forgotten
after
the
war
.

Some
of
the
mill
buildings
were
reconstructed
and
over
the
next
000
years
,
continued
to
operate
variously
as
oil
,
saw
,
grist
and
spoke
mills
.

East
Pikeland
Township
has
seen
considerable
change
since
the
early
part
of
the
00th
century
.

The
area
around
Kimberton
saw
expanded
housing
areas
,
as
did
the
corridors
near
Routes
00
&
000
.

Only
the
main
roads
were
paved
,
according
to
a
0000
map
.

The
reason
for
the
growth
in
the
township
over
the
years
has
been
an
influx
of
population
that
has
found
East
Pikeland
Township
an
attractive
and
practical
place
to
live
.

The
suburbanization
of
the
township
,
as
most
areas
,
occurred
as
the
availability
of
automobiles
made
the
general
population
mobile
.

In
0000
,
the
township
population
was
000
.

Space
to
house
the
ever-increasing
population
came
from
the
conversion
of
lands
that
had
traditionally
been
dairy
or
wheat
farms
.

Although
some
farms
remain
today
,
the
predominant
land
use
pattern
in
the
central
portion
of
the
township
is
residential
.

The
spread
of
suburban
development
has
occurred
primarily
in
the
French
Creek
valley
,
along
Cold
Stream
Road
.

Also
occurring
since
World
War
II
has
been
the
development
of
townhouse
complexes
,
shopping
centers
and
industrial
sites
,
such
as
the
Cromby
Power
Station
(
PECO
)
and
shopping
centers
along
Routes
00
&
000
.

The
closing
of
the
remaining
one
and
two
room
school
houses
occurred
in
the
0000s
,
in
favor
of
the
regional
school
system
.

East
Pikeland
Township
is
a
township

the
second

known
as
East

History
The
land
that
eventually
became
Easttown
Township
was
once
part
of
the
Welsh
Tract
,
a
large
expanse
of
land
promised
by
William
Penn
to
a
group
of
Welsh
Quaker
settlers
in
which
they
would
be
able
to
speak
and
conduct
business
in
the
Welsh
language
.

While
the
autonomous
entity
envisioned
by
some
was
never
formed
,
it
left
its
mark
in
the
many
Welsh
place
names
that
still
exist
,
such
as
the
village
of
Berwyn
,
in
Easttown
,
and
nearby
Tredyffrin
Township
.

The
township
is
believed
to
have
been
incorporated
in
0000
,
as
that
is
the
earliest
date
it
has
been
found
to
be
referred
to
in
official
records
.

While
the
originators
of
the
Welsh
Tract
were
Quakers
,
the
earliest
settlers
in
the
portion
that
became
Easttown
Township
were
mostly
Anglicans
.

St.
David
's
Episcopal
Church
,
just
past
the
eastern
edge
of
the
township
,
was
constructed
in
0000
by
Welsh
Anglicans
when
the
mother
church
sent
them
a
minister
.

Revolutionary
War
leader
Anthony
Wayne
was
born
and
lived
in
Waynesborough
house
,
in
the
western
part
of
the
township
.

He
—
or
at
least
part
of
him
—
is
buried
at
St.
David
's
.

A
Revolutionary
War
skirmish
that
occurred
along
a
ridge
in
the
center
of
the
township
was
the
only
engagement
of
that
war
in
the
township
.

The
name
of
the
British
commander
was
later
given
to
a
nearby
mansion
:
Tarleton
.

Two
sites
in
the
township
are
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
:
Waynesborough
and
Roughwood
.

The
cluster
of
buildings
that
forms
the
village
of
Leopard
,
identified
as
a
"
Significant
Historic
Cluster
"
in
the
Chester
County
Historic
Sites
Survey
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
is
eligible
for
listing
as
well
.

In
addition
,
the
Waterloo
Mills
Historic
District
has
been
designated
.

Although
St.
David
's
Church
is
just
over
the
line
in
Newtown
Township
,
the
church
building
and
its
graveyard
(
most
of
which
is
in
Easttown
)
are
listed
together
in
the
National
Register
.

Easttown
Township
is
said
to
have
the
most-litigated
zoning
law
in
Pennsylvania
,
largely
as
a
result
of
its
efforts
to
avoid
being
swallowed
up
by
the
expansion
of
the
suburbs
of
Philadelphia
.

At
least
two
major
cases
about
minimum
lot
size
were
handed
down
by
the
Pennsylvania
Supreme
Court
:
Bilbar
Construction
upheld
the
township
's
minimum
lot
sizes
,
while
National
Land
and
Investment
Co.
.

struck
them
down
as
"
exclusionary
"
seven
years
later
.

National
Land
further
held
that
a
municipality
may
utilize
zoning
measures
that
are
substantially
related
to
the
protection
and
preservation
of
the
municipality
's
proper
interest
in
providing
for
the
general
welfare
of
its
residents
,
but
Easttown
's
zoning
did
not
pass
the
test
.

Ironically
,
despite
the
developer-litigants
'
claimed
interest
in
allowing
poor
people
to
live
in
Easttown
,
they
only
built
houses
that
sold
at
well
over
the
average
value
in
Pennsylvania
.

Elverson
is
a
borough
in
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the

census
.

Settled
near
the
region
's
early
iron
mines
,
Elverson
is
close
to
Hopewell
Furnace
National
Historic
Site
,
an
example
of
a
00th
century
"
iron
plantation
"
.

History
Elverson
's
earliest
settlers
arrived
in
the
late
00th
century
when
the
area
was
known
as
Springfield
.

Later
dubbed
Blue
Rock
after
a
deposit
of
peculiar
rocks
not
far
from
the
town
,
it
remained
largely
rural
until
the
arrival
of
the
Wilmington
and
Northern
Railroad
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
the
town
's
population
had
more
than
doubled
.

In
0000
,
the
settlement
was
named
Elverson
after
James
Elverson
,
owner
of
The
Philadelphia
Inquirer
,
who
would
later
donate
a
stained
glass
window
to
a
church
there
.

The
Borough
of
Elverson
was
officially
incorporated
on
April
00
,
0000
,
from
land
annexed
from
West
Nantmeal
Township
,
and
it
remained
the
commercial
center
of
northwestern
Chester
County
through
the
first
half
of
the
00th
century
.

In
0000
the
borough
annexed
additional
land
,
resulting
in
its
current
size
of
about
one
square
mile
.

Elverson
's
building
styles
follow
the
periods
of
its
commercial
growth
and
range
from
early
00th
century
stone
or
log
buildings
to
post-railroad
Queen
Anne
structures
and
00th
century
craftsman
and
Foursquare
-
style
houses
.

Commercial
and
residential
development
since
the
0000s
has
occurred
largely
on
the
outskirts
of
the
borough
's
historic
center
.

The
Wilmington
and
Northern
Railroad
line
,
later
incorporated
into
the
Reading
Railroad
system
,
was
abandoned
and
removed
in

CDP
)
in
West
Whiteland

,
Chester
County

Pennsylvania
,
United

.

Its

History
Exton
lies
at
the
intersection
of
U.S.
Route
00
(
formerly
the
Lancaster
Road
,
and
later
the
Lincoln
Highway
)
and
Pennsylvania
Route
000
(
Pottstown
Pike
)
.

Beginning
in
the
late
00th
century
,
the
Lancaster
Road
became
a
major
transportation
route
between
Philadelphia
and
the
west
,
while
what
is
now
Route
000
was
a
regional
north-south
route
to
Pottstown
.

A
theory
exists
that
Exton
was
named
as
the
"
X
"
on
the
map
,
denoting
this
intersection
,
though
more
likely
the
village
was
named
after
one
of
the
several
Exton
s
in
the
United
Kingdom
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
Exton
became
home
to
the
Newcomen
Society
of
the
United

of
the
learned

was
built
overlooking

on

Road
,
and
featured

,
a
printing
shop
,
library
and
museum
,
guest
houses
,
a
chapel
and
a
belltower
with
a
carillon
.

The
Newcomen
Society
sold
the
property
in
the
late
0000s
,
but
its
campus
remains
an
Exton
landmark
serving
as
the
headquarters
of
another
business
.

Lionville
is
a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
in
Uwchlan
Township
,
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Prior
to
0000
the
CDP
was
recorded
as
Lionville-Marchwood
.
"

Marchwood
"
,
however
,
refers
only
to
the
housing
development
begun
in
the
early
0000s
that
is
located
south
of
the
000-000
intersection
.

Lionville
is
bisected
by
two
major
local
highways
,
PA
000
and
PA
000
.

The
area
contains
residential
neighborhoods
,
hotels
,
restaurants
,
and
other
businesses
.

The
original
name
of
the
village
was
Welsh
Pool
,
but
to
honor
the
local
Red
Lion
Inn
the
name
was
changed
to
Lionville
,
since
a
borough
of
Red
Lion
,
Pennsylvania
,
already
existed
.

The
area
of
Lionville
along
Village
Avenue
is
a
protected
historic
district
.

The
Friends
Meeting
House
was
used
as
a
hospital
by
the
Continental
Army
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.

Lionville
has
an
independent
zip
code
and
post
office
,
but
it
has
never
had
mail
delivery
.

Many
of
the
long-term
residents
who
picked
up
mail
at
the
now-closed
general
store
or
fire
station
locations
now
use
a
Downingtown
address
.

Because
much
of
the
area
also
falls
under
the
Exton
zip
code
,
many
Lionville
businesses
use
the
Exton
name
instead
,
especially
if
they
do
not
have
other
locations
in
the
area
.

Name
No
official
origin
to

theories
abound

The

Hills

Malvern
Hill
in
Virginia

As

raised

the
surrounding
communities
,
it
is
possible
either
location
in
Britain

Virginia
could
have
been
the
influence
,

the
truth
is
lost
to
history

Polis
(
;
,
)
,
plural
poleis
(
,
)
,
literally
means
city
in
Greek
.

It
could
also
mean
citizenship
and
body
of
citizens
.

In
modern
historiography
"
polis
"
is
normally
used
to
indicate
the
ancient
Greek
city-states
,
like
Classical
Athens
and
its
contemporaries
,
so
polis
is
often
translated
as
"
city-state
"
.

Ancient
Greek
city-states
,
which
developed
during
the
Archaic
period
,
the
ancestor
of
city
,
state
and
citizenship
,
and
persisted
(
though
with
decreasing
influence
)
well
into
Roman
times
,
when
the
equivalent
Latin
word
was
civitas
,
also
meaning
"
citizenhood
"
,
while
municipium
applied
to
a
non-sovereign
local
entity
.

The
term
city-state
which
originated
in
English
(
alongside
the
German
Stadtstaat
)
does
not
fully
translate
the
Greek
term
.

The
poleis
were
not
like
other
primordial
ancient
city-states
like
Tyre
or
Sidon
,
which
were
ruled
by
a
king
or
a
small
oligarchy
,
but
rather
a
political
entity
ruled
by
its
body
of
citizens
.

The
traditional
view
of
archaeologists
,
that
the
appearance
of
urbanization
at
excavation
sites
could
be
read
as
a
sufficient
index
for
the
development
of
a
polis
was
criticised
by
François
Polignac
in
0000
and
has
not
been
taken
for
granted
in
recent
decades
:
the
polis
of
Sparta
for
example
was
established
in
a
network
of
villages
.

The
term
polis
,
which
in
archaic
Greece
meant
city
,
changed
with
the
development
of
the
governance
center
in
the
city
to
indicate
state
(
which
included
its
surrounding
villages
)
,
and
finally
with
the
emergence
of
a
citizenship
notion
between
the
land
owners
it
came
to
describe
the
entire
body
of
citizens
.

The
ancient
Greeks
did
not
always
refer
to
Athens
,
Sparta
,
Thebes
,
and
other
poleis
as
such
;
they
often
spoke
instead
of
the
Athenians
,
Lacedaemonians
,
Thebans
and
so
on
.

The
body
of
citizens
came
to
be
the
most
important
meaning
of
the
term
polis
in
ancient
Greece
as
a
polis
.

The
Greek
term
which
specifically
meant
the
totality
of
urban
buildings
and
spaces
is
(
)
.

The
polis
in
Ancient
Greek
philosophy
Plato
analyses
the
polis
in
Republic
,
whose
Greek
title
Πολιτεία
(
Politeia
)
itself
derives
from
the
word
polis
.

The
best
form
of
government
of
the
polis
for
Plato
is
the
one
that
leads
to
the
common
good
.

The
philosopher
king
is
the
best
ruler
because
,
as
a
philosopher
,
he
is
acquainted
with
the
Form
of
the
Good
.

In
Plato
's
analogy
of
the
ship
of
state
,
the
philosopher
king
steers
the
polis
,
as
if
it
were
a
ship
,
in
the
best
direction
.

Archaic
and
classical
polis
Basic
and
indicating
elements
are
:
Hellenistic
and
Roman
During
the
Hellenistic
period
,
which
marks
the
decline
of
the
classical
polis
,
the
following
cities
remained
independent
:
Sparta
until
000
BC
after
the
War
against
Nabis
.

Achaean
League
is
the
last
example
of
original
Greek
city-state
federations
(
dissolved
after
the
Battle
of
Corinth
(
000
BC
)
)
.

The
Cretan
city-states
continue
to
be
independent
(
except
Itanus
and
Arsinoe
,
which
lay
under
Ptolemaic
influence
)
until
the
conquest
of
Crete
in
00
BC
by
Rome
.

The
cities
of
Magna
Graecia
,
with
the
notable
examples
of
Syracuse
and
Tarentum
,
were
conquered
by
Rome
in
late
0rd
century
BC
.

There
are
also
some
cities
with
recurring
independence
like
Samos
,
Priene
,
Miletus
,
and
Athens
.

A
remarkable
example
of
a
city-state
which
flourished
during
this
era
is
Rhodes
through
its
merchant
navy
,
until
00
BC
and
the
Roman
conquest
.

The
Hellenistic
colonies
and
cities
of
the
era
,
retain
some
basic
characteristics
of
a
polis
,
except
:
the
status
of
independence
(
city-state
)
and
the
political
life
.

There
is
a
self-governance
(
like
the
new
Macedonian
title
politarch
)
but
under
a
ruler
and
king
.

The
political
life
of
the
classical
era
is
now
transformed
to
an
individualized
religious
and
philosophical
view
of
life
(
see
Hellenistic
philosophy
and
religion
)
The
demographic
decline
forced
the
cities
to
abolish
the
status
of
metic
and
bestow
citizenship
;
in
000
BC
Miletus
enfranchised
over
0000
Cretans
.

Dyme
sold
its
citizenship
for
one
talent
,
payable
in
two
instalments
.

The
foreign
residents
in
a
city
are
now
called
paroikoi
.

In
an
age
,
when
most
of
the
establishments
in
Asia
are
kingdoms
,
an
interesting
example
of
a
Hellenistic
cities
federation
is
the
Chrysaorian
League
in
Caria
.

During
the
Roman
era
,
some
cities
were
granted
the
status
of
a
polis
,
free
city
,
self-governed
under
the
Roman
Empire
.

The
last
institution
commemorating
the
old
Greek
poleis
was
the
Panhellenion
established
by
Hadrian
.

Derived
words
Derivatives
of
polis
are
common
in
many
modern
Europe
an

This
is

of
the

of

Hellenic
world

Oxford
is
a
borough
in
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Oxford
is
the
closest
town
to
Lincoln
University
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
borough
was
once
called
Oxford
Crossing
and
Oxford
Village
.

Oxford
was
located
near
the
half-way
point
on
the
main
road
from
Philadelphia
to
Baltimore
.

The
owner
of
the
stage
between
the
two
cities
purchased
Hood
's
Tavern
and
renamed
it
Oxford
Hotel
.

It
became
the
stopping
point
on
the
two-day
trip
between
the
two
cities
.

In
0000
,
Oxford
was
officially
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

Its
first
burgess
(
now
called
the
mayor
)
was
Thomas
Alexander
,
who
operated
a
general
store
in
which
the
oldest
public
library
in
Pennsylvania
was
located
.

His
store
is
thought
to
be
the
oldest
building
in
Oxford
.

The
northern
half
of
Oxford
was
owned
by
the
Dickey
family
in
the
00th
century
.

The
Dickeys
included
the
local
Presbyterian
minister
,
the
Mr
O'Malley
of
the
local
bank
,
a
state
Representative
,
and
local
businessmen
.

Reverend
John
Miller
Dickey
and
his
wife
Sarah
Emlen
Cresson
founded
Ashmun
Institute
in
0000
,
and
which
later
became
Lincoln
University
.

The
family
played
a
major
role
in
re-routing
the
new
Philadelphia
and
Baltimore
Central
Railroad
(
P&BC
)
through
Oxford
.

Track
was
laid
in
the
0000s
.

The
railroad
reached
Oxford
in
0000
and
later
connected
to
Philadelphia
and
Baltimore
.

By
the
time
of
the
Civil
War
,
Oxford
was
a
bustling
community
.

The
business
district
on
Third
Street
was
entirely
re-built
at
this
time
,
including
the
Oxford
Hotel
(
0000
)
and
Oxford
Hall
(
0000
)
.

Oxford
became
known
for
its
confectionery
and
candy
businesses
and
was
the
location
of
many
manufacturing
facilities
.

A
second
railroad
,
the
Peach
Bottom
Railway
,
was
built
in
the
0000s
from
Oxford
to
Peach
Bottom
.

It
carried
farm
products
and
passengers
but
was
not
profitable
.

It
struggled
through
three
bankruptcies
and
reorganized
as
the
Lancaster
,
Oxford
and
Southern
Railway
,
finally
closing
permanently
in
0000
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
took
control
of
the
P&BC
on
the
eve
of
World
War
I
.

Passenger
train
service
on
the
line
ended
in
0000
.

In
the
late
00th
century
,
transportation
changes
resulted
in
Oxford
being
located
off
the
main
roads
.

A
bypass
was
constructed
for
U.S.
Route
0
in
the
late
0000s
,
but
the
major
change
was
the
0000
opening
of
Interstate
00
,
which
shifted
the
bulk
of
the
Philadelphia-Baltimore
traffic
away
from
Oxford
.

The
former
Pennsylvania
Railroad
Station
is
now
the
local
police
station
.

a
borough
in

County

French
Creek
with
the
Schuylkill
River
.

History
Originally
called
Manavon
,
Phoenixville
was
settled
in
0000
and
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

In
its
industrial
heyday
early
in
the
twentieth
century
,
it
was
an
important
manufacturing
center
and
it
was
the
site
of
great
iron
and
steel
mills
such
as
the
Phoenix
Iron
Works
,
boiler
works
,
silk
mill
,
underwear
and
hosiery
factories
,
a
match
factory

famous
(
and
now
highly
collectible
)
Etruscan
majolica
pottery
.

Like
so
many
American
towns
and
cities
,
Phoenixville
owes
its
growth
to
its
waterways
.

It
is
not
only
situated
on
the
broad
Schuylkill
River
,
a
historic
thoroughfare
to
Native
Americans

alike
,
but
it
is
bisected
by
the
fast-flowing
French
Creek
,
which
was
quickly
harnessed
for
water
power
.

Much
of
this
history
was
recognized
by
the
creation
of
the
Phoenixville
Historic
District
,

largest
National

of
Historic

Phoenixville
Station
in
0000
,
when
SEPTA
ceased
operating
non-electrified
commuter
lines
.

Norfolk
Southern
Railway
(
NS
)
currently
utilizes
the
busy
line
on
a
daily
basis
as
part
of
its
Harrisburg
Line
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
(
PRR
)
Schuylkill
Branch
also
served
Phoenixville
.

The
line
enters
town
crossing
the
Schuylkill
River
from
neighboring
Mont
Clare
on
a
high
bridge
,
north
of
French
Creek
.

The
line
passes
along
the
north
side
of
the
former
Phoenix
Iron
Works
site
.

The
station
on
Vanderslice
Street
,
west
of
Gay
Street
,
no
longer
exists
.

Past
the
Works
,
the
line
splits
.

The
main
fork
passed
through
the
now
abandoned
Phoenixville
Tunnel
,
which
partially
collapsed
in
the
0000s
,
and
continued
toward
Reading
.

The
other
fork
continued
along
the
Pickering
Creek
Valley
and
used
to
connect
with
the
Main
Line
at
Paoli
.

A
section
of
the
line
remains
in
place
,
and
is
currently
known
as
the
Phoenixville
Industrial
track
(
also
owned
by
NS
)
.

Passenger
service
ended
in
0000
and
regular
freight
service
on
the
line
ceased
in
0000
.

During
the
0000
replacement
of
the
Gay
Street
Bridge
,
the
line
was
severed
at
its
crossing
of
Main
Street
and
that
rail
bridge
raised
a
few
feet
to
allow
emergency
vehicles
to
reach
the
north
side
of
town
.

Interest
to
resume
passenger
rail
service
was
spurred
by
the
Schuylkill
Valley
Metro
(
SVM
)
project
,
which
was
rejected
by
Federal
Transit
Administration
in
0000
.

Another
project
,
called
the
Greenline
,
has
since
been
proposed
an
alternative
to
the
SVM
.

It
would
utilize
the
Phoenixville
Industrial
track
,
to
give
Phoenixville
a
rail
link
to
Philadelphia
via
Paoli
and
the
Paoli/Thorndale
Line
of
regional
rail
.

The
effort
to
resume
passenger
train
service
has
led
to
the
creation
of
the
group
Citizens
for
the
Train
.

Spring
City
is
a
borough
in
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Spring
City
is
a
member
of
the
Spring-Ford
Area
School
District
.

It
is
situated
along
the
Schuylkill
River
,
which
divides
Chester
and
Montgomery
counties
.

Directly
across
the
river
is
the
borough
of
Royersford
.

History
The
first
people
in
this
area
were
the
Lenni-Lenape
Indians
,
who
inhabited
the
Schuylkill
watershed
long
before
European
colonization
.

The
first
non-Native
American
,
arriving
in
the
late
00th
century
,
was
a
French
Canadian
fur
trapper
named
Pierre
Bezallion
.

The
Lenni-Lenape
,
who
hunted
and
fished
in
the
area
,
traded
with
Bezallion
.

As
a
result
,
William
Penn
called
upon
him
when
needed
to
act
as
an
arbitrator
in
Indian
affairs
.

Bezallion
used
a
natural
cave
that
was
in
Spring
City
to
store
his
furs
and
to
stay
over
when
he
was
trapping
in
this
area
.

However
neither
he
nor
the
Indians
made
this
area
their
permanent
home
.

Pierre
Bezallion
died
in
0000
and
is
buried
in
Compass
(
near
Coatesville
)
.

As
this
area
was
settled
it
came
to
be
referred
to
as
"
Pump
Town
"
,
so
named
due
to
a
public
pump
frequented
by
citizens
and
visitors
.

The
early
residents
had
quite
a
battle
over
settling
on
an
official
name
.

There
was
a
group
who
fought
for
the
name
"
Pumptown
"
and
others
who
liked
Jamestown
.

Eventually
the
natural
springs
in
the
area
proffered
an
obvious
name
and
"
Springville
"
was
chartered
on
August
00
,
0000
.

Yet
even
this
choice
would
n’t
stand
,
as
it
was
discovered
that
Pennsylvania
already
had
a
Springville
.

So
,
in
0000
the
name
was
changed
to
Spring
City
.

It
was
the
opening
of
the
Schuylkill
Navigation
Canal
in
0000
that
can
be
directly
attributed
to
the
early
development
of
this
small
town
.

In
0000
,
the
first
bridge
to
connect
Spring
City
to
Royersford
across
the
Schuylkill
was
completed
.

It
was
a
covered
wooden
bridge
.

Canal-born
industries
such
as
the
American
Paper
Company
and
the
Spring
City
Stove
Company
were
operating
as
early
as
the
0000s
,
and
people
were
coming
to
live
in
Springville
.

As
the
people
came
,
with
them
came
the
houses
,
churches
,
schools
,
and
of
course
local
government
.

Other
industries
such
as
glass
making
and
knitting
mills
would
soon
follow
.

Main
Street
was
the
center
of
activity
in
Spring
City
.

It
was
where
the
businesses
,
stores
and
banks
were
located
.

The
National
Bank
of
Spring
City
,
the
Gem
Theatre
,
the
Spring
City
Hotel
,
and
Mowery-Latshaw
Hardware
were
but
a
few
of
the
many
establishments
that
were
downtown
on
Main
Street
.

Spring
City
had
a
large
industrial
development
at
the
lower
end
of
town
on
South
Main
Street
and
the
Valley
Forge
Flag
Company
on
North
Main
at
the
foot
of
Yost
Avenue
.

The
Spring
City
Hotel
is
located
downtown
at
the
corner
of
Main
and
New
streets
.

The
cornerstone
for
this
hotel
was
laid
in
0000
.

When
it
was
completed
,
it
was
the
showplace
of
the
town
.

The
hotel
had
gas
and
electric
lights
,
flush
toilets
,
and
hot
and
cold
running
water
in
the
bathrooms
.

This
hotel
is
still
in
operation
today
and
features
a
dining
room
and
cocktail
lounge
.

The
Spring
City
National
bank
first
opened
for
business
in
0000
.

The
building
is
still
in
existence
and
is
now
a
private
residence
.

The
Valley
Forge
Flag
Factory
was
at
the
corner
of
Yost
Avenue
and
Main
Street
in
Spring
City
.

The
company
began
operation
around
0000
in
Spring
City
when
the
property
was
acquired
from
the
Reiff
shirt
factory
.

Although
flag
manufacturing
has
ceased
in
Spring
City
,
today
the
buildings
have
been
given
a
new
lease
on
life
as
the
Flag
House
apartments
for
senior
citizens
.

In
0000
a
post
office
was
opened
in
Spring
City
.

John
Sheeler
was
the
postmaster
,
and
the
office
was
located
on
the
west
end
of
the
canal
bridge
in
the
vicinity
of
the
present-day
Turkey
Hill
store
.

In
0000
,
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
opened
from
Reading
to
Philadelphia
,
with
a
station
stop
in
Spring
City
.

This
gave
the
Reading
Company
in
Royersford
some
competition
.

In
0000
,
the
Spring
City
Trolley
would
begin
operations
.

The
trolley
traveled
from
Spring
City
to
Phoenixville
and
made
many
stops
on
its
way
,
one
being
the
Bonnie
Brae
Amusement
Park
.

Trolley
service
continued
until
the
great
trolley
accident
on
July
0
,
0000
.

The
end
of
the
trolley
spelled
the
end
of
Bonnie
Brae
and
the
end
of
an
era
.

The
first
public
school
in
Spring
City
was
held
at
the
Lyceum
building
at
Hall
and
Main
streets
.

In
0000
,
classes
were
moved
to
the
Union
Meeting
House
and
later
to
a
small
school
building
behind
the
old
Lutheran
Church
.

It
was
not
until
0000
that
the
Church
Street
School
was
constructed
.

This
brownstone
building
was
enlarged
in
0000
and
was
big
enough
to
house
all
00
grades
.

In
0000
,
the
high
school
on
New
Street
opened
,
and
the
Church
Street
School
became
a
grade
school
.

Both
of
these
buildings
are
now
gone
.

In
0000
the
jointure
was
formed
with
Spring
City
and
Royersford
becoming
part
of
the
Spring-Ford
Area
School
District
.

A
new
elementary
school
on
Wall
Street
was
opened
in
0000
,
and
a
new
high
school
on
Lewis
road
in
Royersford
opened
in
0000
.

The
senior
high
school
now
occupies
a
new
building
across
the
street
from
the
one
built
in
0000
.

Mechanics
Hall
is
the
second
oldest
public
meetinghouse
in
Spring
City
.

Located
at
the
bottom
of
Hall
Street
across
from
the
firehouse
,
it
is
now
known
as
the
Tall
Cedars
Temple
.

This
building
was
constructed
in
0000
and
was
used
by
many
organizations
.

Several
churches
,
including
the
Lutheran
and
Reformed
,
held
services
there
before
their
houses
of
worship
were
completed
.

In
0000
,
the
Spring
City
Borough
Council
purchased
a
new
firefighting
apparatus
from
the
Silsby
Manufacturing
Company
in
New
York
at
a
cost
of
$
0000
.

This
action
was
a
result
of
a
fire
that
destroyed
the
Shantz
&
Keeley
Stove
Works
in
July
0000
.

The
Liberty
Steam
Fire
Engine
Company
No.
0
,
a
volunteer
firefighting
organization
,
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

The
firehouse
was
built
at
the
bottom
of
Hall
Street
in
0000
.

The
firefighters
today
are
still
volunteers
.

Horse
racing
began
in
0000
as
the
Spring
City
Driving
Association
acquired
a
large
property
on
Wall
Street
.

There
were
grandstands
and
stables
on
the
grounds
.

Racing
and
horse
shows
were
held
regularly
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

This
track
was
located
on
Wall
Street
,
where
the
Spring
City
Elementary
School
now
stands
.

The
property
was
vacated
and
sold
to
the
school
district
in
0000
.

The
Pennhurst
State
School
and
Hospital
in
Spring
City
was
opened
in
0000
.

Sitting
high
atop
Crab
Hill
,
looking
down
on
the
Schuylkill
River
,
it
was
a
community
that
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
Spring
City
.

A
sprawling
complex
of
red
brick
buildings
,
it
included
a
dairy
farm
,
power
house
,
greenhouses
,
movie
theater
,
laundry
,
cafeteria
and
many
other
facilities
.

Pennhurst
was
a

at
one
time
had
more
than
0000
patients
.

The
hospital
has
been
closed
,
and
most
of
the
buildings
remain
empty
today
.

The
New

building
on
the
upper
campus
was
completely
renovated
and
is
now
the
main
building
of
the
Southeastern
Veterans
'
Center
.

The
Spring
City
Free
Public
Library
was
established
in
0000
.

The
following
year
,
the
Women
's
Library
Club
of
Spring
City
was
founded
by
Mrs.
H.
Wells
Taylor
.

Taylor
gathered
a
small
group
of
women
in
her
home
to
discuss
their
mutual
concern
of
assisting
the
library
and
keeping
it
in
operation
.

The
ladies
formed
the
“
Women
’s
Auxiliary
to
the
Free
Public
Library
”
and
elected
Mrs.
Taylor
as
the
first
president
,
a
post
she
held
through
0000
.

Their
main
purpose
was
to
assist
in
the
maintenance
of
the
borough
’s
library
,
to
help
educate
the
youths
in
a
taste
for
good
literature
and
to
profit
by
meeting
together
for
mutual
helpfulness
.

The
first
librarian
was
S.
Elizabeth
Rogers
who
held
that
post
from
0000
to
0000
.

She
was
succeeded
by
M.
Bertha
Brower
,
who
was
the
librarian
from
0000
to
0000
.

Other
directors
included
Matilda
Diemer
,
Dorothy
Borst
,
Anita
Regester
,
and
Suzanne
Macaulay
.

The
current
Library
Director
is
Nicole
McCourt
Socha
.

In
0000
the
library
moved
to
its
current
location
on
Broad
Street
.

Formerly
a
one-room
school
house
,
the
building
has
been
expanded
twice
,
most
recently
in
0000
funded
by
the
Bard
Foundation
.

At
the
library
is
in
need
of
more
space
.

The
Spring
City
Free
Public
Library
Board
of
Trustees
is
currently
embarking
on
a
building
project
with
a
goal
of
expanding
the
current
location
to
a
building
with
a
second
floor
loft
space
for
programming
.

Spring
City
has
a
rich
history
.

At
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
it
was
a
growing
,
vibrant
and
complete
community
.

There
was
all
of
the
industrial
development
,
agricultural
development
,
and
commercial
enterprise
needed
to
support
a
growing
town
.

Schools
,
churches
,
and
numerous
social
organizations
were
growing
with
the
population
.

For
recreation
there
were
two
movie
theaters
on
Main
Street
and
an
amusement
park
just
outside
of
town
that
could
be
easily
reached
with
a
short
trip
on
the
trolley
.

Horse
racing
at
the
track
on
Wall
Street
was
also
very
popular
and
attracted
people
from
several
nearby
states
.

The
canal
was
used
for
boating
and
fishing
during
the
summer
months
and
ice
skating
in
the
winter
.

Trains
ran
on
a
regular
schedule
for
those
wishing
to
travel
to
Reading
or
Philadelphia
and
beyond
.

Although
progress
and
the
passing
of
time
has
changed
the
face
of
Spring
City
,
the
00st
century
brings
promise
,
as
the
citizens
who
live
here
today
are
infused
with
the
spirit
and
resolve
of
those
who
originally
settled
here
!

Thornbury
Township
is
a
township
in
Chester
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
adjacent
to
,
and
was
once
joined
with
Thornbury
Township
,
Delaware
County
,
Pennsylvania
.

History
Thornbury
Township
was
organized
in
0000
with
the
appointment
of
Hugh
Durborrow
as
constable
and
received
its
name
from
Thornbury
,
in
Gloucestershire
,
England
.

At
the
time
not
more
than
five
or
six
families
lived
within
the
limits
of
the
township
.

George
Peirce
,
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
influential
inhabitants
of
the
township
,
had
a
wife
who
was
a
native
of
Thornbury
,
in
England
,
and
the
township
was
purportedly
named
to
compliment
her
.

Thornbury
,
Birmingham
and
Westtown
townships
are
the
only
townships
within
the
present
limits
of
Chester
County
which
were
organized
before
0000
.

The
township
was
divided
when
Delaware
County
was
separated
from
Chester
County
in
0000
.

As
a
result
,
there
is
a
Thornbury
Township
in
each
county
.

Landowners
were
allowed
to
choose
which
county
they
wished
to
be
in
,
causing
the
line
between
the
two
townships
,
and
the
two
counties
,
to
be
very
irregular
.

The
Battle
of
Brandywine
,
part
of
the
American
Revolutionary
War
took
place
partially
in
the
town
.

It
was
one

's

Squire
Thomas
Cheyney
,
who
informed
George

commander
of

Thomas
and
Mary
Rowland
settled
in
the
valley
,
near
the
present
village
of
Toughkenamon
,
in
0000
,
being
perhaps
the
first
settlers
who
purchased
lands
in
New
Garden
Township
.

They
came
to
the
township
from
old
Ashton
Township
,
old
Chester
County
,
now
in
Delaware
County
.

Toughkenamon
has
been
of
significant
importance
in
the
development
of
the
United
States
.

First
,
the
characteristics
of
the
interactions
between
settlers
and
Lenapes
was
a
microcosm
of
the
conflicts
that
would
occur
in
the
future
.

For
example
,
the
farmers
dug
trenches
around
their
crops
,
and
filled
them
with
water
,
to
prevent
reoccurrence
of
the
conflagration
that
occurred
when
local
Lenapes
started
a
burn
.

The
fact
that
the
original
Toughkenamon
settlers
maintained
water-filled
trenches
is
evidence
that
they
had
dialogue
and
an
understanding
of
the
importance
of
the
burn
.

The
traditional
burn
was
an
ancient
way
to
increase
yields
of
local
grains
and
tubers
,
and
increase
the
deer
population
.

But
later
settlers
no
longer
interacted
with
the
departed
tribe
,
so
falsely
assumed
the
burns
had
been
solely
aimed
at
destroying
their
ancestors
'
crops
,
adding
to
mistrust
of
remaining
Indian
families
in
nearby
counties
.

Toughkenamon
Hill
has
been
quarried
for
centuries
.

In
later
centuries
Toughkenamon
was
considered
a
village
.

It
was
an
early
industrial
center
due
to
its
strategic
location
on
the
old
Baltimore
Pike
between
Philadelphia
and
Washington
,
D.C.
,
easy
access
to
raw
materials
such
as
wood
,
water
and
ore
.

Even
today
,
businesses
critical
to
national
wholesale
distribution
of
perishable
foods
are
located
in
and
near
Toughkenamon
.

History
On
00
March
0000
,
William
Penn
decided
to
set
aside
a
portion
of
Pennsylvania
for
the
Welsh
to
settle
in
.

This
area
,
known
as
the
"
Welsh
Tract
"
,
was
surveyed
in
0000
and
included
several
modern-day
townships
,
including
Tredyffrin
.

Although
the
Welsh
Tract
was
originally
meant
to
be
a
self-ruling
municipality
,
it
was
divided
between
Chester
County
and
Philadelphia
when
that
county
was
created
in
0000
,
and
the
Welsh
subsequently
submitted
to
the
authority
of
Chester
County
.

In
0000
,
Tredyffrin
was
incorporated
as
a
township
.

This
name
comes
from
the
Welsh
tref
,
which
means
"
town
"
,
joined
to
dyffryn
,
which
means
"
wide
,
cultivated
valley
"
.

Tredyffrin
was
quick
to
develop
into
a
thriving
township
.

In
0000
,
the
first
mill
in
Tredyffrin
was
started
by
Thomas
Jerman
on
what
is
now
North
Valley
Road
.

Swedesford
Road
,
one
of
the
first
roads
in
the
township
,
was
created
by
0000
.

As
the
population
of
the
township
grew
,
with
00
resident
landowners
in
0000
and
00
in
0000
,
church
es
sprung
up
to
meet
the
demand
by
religious
residents
.

In
0000
,
the
Baptist
minister
Hugh
Davis
moved
to
the
Great
Valley
from
Britain
and
,
there
being
several
Baptist
families
in
this
area
,
the
Great
Valley
Baptist
Church
was
formed
on
00
April
0000
.

The
church
originally
met
in
Radnor
.

However
,
there
were
enough
members
of
this
Baptist
church
that
by
0000
,
a
log
building
was
erected
in
Tredyffrin
to
serve
the
congregation
.

In
0000
,
the
Great
Valley
Presbyterian
Church
was
started
in
Tredyffrin
.

It
was
the
first
Presbyterian
church
in
Chester
County
.

A
church
building
was
built
in
0000
and
was
used
for
00
years
.

Also
in
0000
,
the
Quaker
Haverford
Monthly
Meeting
(
which
was
established
in
April
0000
)
voted
to
allow
its
members
that
lived
in
the
Great
Valley
to
hold
a
meeting
every
other
month
in
Tredyffrin
,
which
was
called
the
Valley
Meeting
.

There
was
also
an
Anglican
church
,
built
in
0000
.

As
Tredyffrin
includes
part
of
Valley
Forge
National
Historical
Park
,
there
are
many
Revolutionary
War
-
related
sites
in
the
township
,
especially
the
park
and
houses
where
various
generals
were
quartered
.

Development
in
the
township
was
sparked
in
the
00th
century
by
construction
and
advertisement
of
the
"
Main
Line
"
railroad
service
,
which
terminated
in
Paoli
,
which
straddles
the
western
border
of
the
township
.

Tredyffrin-Easttown
school
district
was
unusual
for
the
area
in
being
integrated
during
the
early
part
of
the
century
.

In
the
0000
,
the
district
planned
to
segregate
after
building
a
new
school
,
and
African-Americans
in
the
township
boycotted
the
school
system
for
two
years
in
protest
(
the
"
School
Fight
"
)
.

In
0000
a
negotiated
settlement
was
reached
whereby
the
schools
remained
integrated
,
and
helped
kill
school
segregation
in
Pennsylvania
.

During
the
Cold
War
,
a
Nike
anti-aircraft
missile
site
was
active
in
the
township
.

Meeting
House
on
Harmony
Road
built
in

several
miles
west
of
the

Meeting
House
in

Grove
Township
and

an
incorporated
borough
on

,
0000
.

However
,
the
decree
of
incorporation
was
not
recorded
until
January
0
,
0000
,
to
prevent
confusing
the
tax
accounts
of
London
Grove
Township
and
to
eliminate
the
need
for
a
special
borough
election
.

The
move
for
incorporation
followed
several
years
of
significant
growth
in

is
one
of
the
traditional
provinces
of
Sweden
(
landskap
in
Swedish
)
,
on
the
western
coast
of
Sweden
.

It
borders
Västergötland
,
Småland
,
Scania
and
the
sea
of
Kattegat
.

Administration
The
provinces
of
Sweden
serve
no
administrative
function
.

Instead
,
that
function
is
served
by
the
Counties
of
Sweden
.

However
,
the
province
of
Halland
is
almost
coextensive
with
the
administrative
Halland
County
,
though
parts
of
the
province
belong
to
Västra
Götaland
County
and
Skåne
County
.

As
of
December
00
,
0000
,
Halland
had
a
population
of
000,000
.

Of
these
,
000,000
lived
in
Halland
County
;
00,000
lived
in
Västra
Götaland
County
;
and
0,000
lived
in
Skåne
County
.

Heraldry
During
the
Danish
era
the
province
had
no
coat
of
arms
and
no
seal
.

In
Sweden
,
however
,
every
province
had
been
represented
by
heraldic
arms
since
0000
.

When
Charles
X
Gustav
of
Sweden
suddenly
died
in
0000
a
coat
of
arms
had
to
be
created
for
the
newly
acquired
province
.

Each
province
was
to
be
represented
by
its
arms
at
the
royal
funeral
.

There
are
several
theories
about
the
choice
of
a
lion
.

Bengt
Algotsson
,
duke
of
Halland
and
Finland
in
the
00th
century
,
used
a
lion
in
his
personal
arms
.

Blazon
:
Azure
,
a
Lion
rampant
Argent
langued
,
armed
and
dente
Gules
.

The
same
coat
of
arms
was
later
granted
for
the
administrative
Halland
County
,
which
has
almost
the
same
boundaries
.

Geography
The
streams
of
Lagan
,
Ätran
,
Nissan
and
Viskan
flow
through
the
province
and
reach
the
sea
in
Kattegat
.

Halland
is
well
known
for
its
good
soil
and
as
an
agricultural
district
.

History
Early
history
The
Bronze
Age
was
probably
a
period
of
relative
prosperity
in
Halland
.

This
is
shown
in
the
number
of
new
settlements
and
the
numerous
archaeological
remains
.

Over
0,000
tumuli
and
grave
mounds
are
found
.

The
end
of
the
Bronze
Age
witnesses
an
over-consumption
of
the
resources
.

Large
areas
were
deforested
.

This
might
have
been
a
result
of
a
high
demand
for
charcoal
in
smelting
gold
or
bronze
among
the
local
elites
.

The
worsening
climate
at
the
beginning
of
the
Iron
Age
meant
that
the
local
elites
no
longer
could
obtain
bronze
to
the
same
extent
as
before
.

As
a
result
the
social
structures
collapsed
.

The
early
Iron
Age
social
structures
seems
to
have
been
relatively
egalitarian
,
but
from
around
000
AD
there
is
a
trend
where
village
s
form
larger
communities
and
small
kingdom
s.
This
is
likely
to
have
been
a
distant
influence
from
the
growing
Roman
empire
.

During
the
0th
and
0th
century
large
free-standing
farms
were
created
;
they
grew
larger
as
time
passed
.

An
example
of
such
a
farm
can
be
found
in
Slöinge
.

It
was
not
just
the
social
structure
that
changed
,
so
too
did
the
settlement
structure
.

New
villages
were
formed
,
while
old
were
abandoned
.

The
new
centers
that
were
formed
became
the
kernel
from
which
new
areas
were
settled
during
medieval
times
.

000-0000
AD
According
to
information
from
a
trader
travelling
from
Skiringssal
,
close
to
the
Oslofjord
to
Hedeby
in
the
000s
it
can
be
concluded
that
Halland
was
a
Danish
area
at
that
time
.

It
would
stay
so
for
the
larger
part
of
recorded
historical
times
.

Iron
extraction
is
known
to
have
taken
place
in
Hishult
and
Tvååker
/
Sibbarp
during
the
Iron
Age
.

As
part
of
Scanian
lands
(
then
part
of
the
Kingdom
of
Denmark
,
Halland
came
under
the
Scanian
Law
and
participated
in
the
Scanian
Thing
,
one
of
three
Thing
electing
the
Danish
king
.

Local
assemblies
took
place
in
Getinge
.

Halland
was
the
scene
of
considerable
military
action
from
the
00th
century
and
on
as
Sweden
,
Denmark
and
to
some
degree
Norway
fought
for
supremacy
in
Scandinavia
.

The
many
wars
made
the
province
poor
.

Not
only
were
material
damages
caused
by
military
action
,
but
the
social
impact
of
the
fighting
was
devastating
;
people
lacked
the
motivation
to
invest
in
their
land
and
properties
as
it
was
likely
to
be
destroyed
anyway
.

The
county
was
the
site
of
combat
and
plunder
three
times
during
the
00th
Century
:
in
0000
Haakon
IV
of
Norway
invaded
,
followed
by
Magnus
I
of
Sweden
in
0000
and
Eric
VI
of
Denmark
in
0000
.

The
county
came
to
be
split
in
two
parts
for
the
next
century
,
with
the
river
Ätran
forming
a
boundary
.

The
lords
of
the
two
parts
succeeded
each
other
in
a
high
tempo
.

As
the
Kalmar
Union
was
formed
,
Halland
came
for
a
brief
period
of
time
to
have
a
rather
central
position
.

The
king
was
to
be
elected
,
according
to
the
union
treaty
,
in
Halmstad
.

During
the
rebellion
of
Engelbrekt
in
0000
the
fortress
in
Falkenberg
was
burnt
down
and
two
years
later
was
captured
by
the
Swedes
.

The
Swedish-Danish
struggles
in
the
early
00th
century
came
to
affect
the
province
as
well
,
as
in
0000
when
the
border
regions
were
sacked
by
the
Swedes
as
a
vengeance
for
similar
Danish
action
in
Västergötland
.

The
Count
's
Feud
,
the
Northern
Seven
Years
'
War
and
the
Kalmar
War
all
affected
Halland
.

One
of
the
major
battles
of
the
Northern
Seven
Years
'
War
,
the
battle
of
Axtorna
took
place
in
Halland
.

After
0000
Halland
was
temporally
(
for
a
period
of
00
years
)
transferred
to
Sweden
in
0000
under
the
terms
of
the
Second
Treaty
of
Brömsebro
.

The
conquest
was
later
made
permanent
by
ceding
of
the
province
in
the
Treaty
of
Roskilde
in
0000
.

The
last
battle
in
Halland
took
place
in
Fyllebro
on
00
August
0000
,
during
the
Scanian
War
.

The
more
peaceful
conditions
that
followed
meant
that
the
province
could
start
to
develop
again
.

The
00th
century
saw
the
farming
develop
quickly
to
become
one
of
the
more
efficient
in
the
country
by
the
end
of
the
century
.

Parts
of
the
province
did
however
remain
poor
and
erosion
and
blown
sand
remained
a
problem
for
much
of
the
century
.

The
county
did
therefor
see
a
lot
of
emigration
,
continuing
well
into
the
00th
century
.

The
00th
century
has
seen
the
province
becoming
one
of
the
fastest
growing
in
Sweden
,
as
it
has
doubled
its
population
since
World
War
II
.

This
is
in
part
due
to
the
northern
parts
,
such
as
Kungsbacka
and
Onsala
,
more
or
less
becoming
suburb
s
of
Gothenburg
.

Cities
Privileges
to
towns
in
Halland
was
during
the
Danish
time
granted
to
:
Such
privileges
have
no
official
significance
nowadays
.

Hundreds
Hundreds
of
Sweden
were
provincial
divisions
until
early
00th
century
,
when
they
lost
importance
.

Halland

,
Halmstad
Hundred
,
Himle

,
Höks

and

Hundred
.

Culture
The
language
varieties
spoken
in
Halland
are
together
called
halländska
,
though
they
belong
to
two
main
dialectal
groups
.

In
northern
Halland
a
variation
of
the
Götaland
dialect
is
spoken
and
in
the
south
the
spoken
language
is
a
variety
of
Scanian
.

Sights
The
Varberg
Fortress
was
built
in
the
00th
century
and
improved
with
higher
walls
in
the
00th
century
.

Dukes
of
Halland
As
early
as
the
00th
century
(
southern
)
Halland
was
given
as
duchy
to
a
branch
of
the
Danish
royal
family
.

In
the
00th
century
,
it
was
given
to
various
relatives
of
Danish
and
Swedish
royal
families
,
such
as
Benedict
,
Duke
of
Halland
0000-00
.

Since
0000
Swedish
royal
princes
have
been
nominated
dukes
of
provinces
without
political
significance
.

Such
a
title
was
held
by
Prince
Bertil
,
Duke
of
Halland
(
0000
–
0000
)
;
who
was
survived
by
Princess
Lilian
,
Duchess
of
Halland
(
0000-0000
)
.

Sports
Football

the
province
is
administered
by
Hallands
Fotbollförbund

In
ancient
Greece
,
the
term
metic
(
Greek
métoikos
:
from
metá
,
indicating
change
,
and
oîkos
"
dwelling
"
)
referred
to
a
resident
alien
,
one
who
did
not
have
citizen
rights
in
his
or
her
Greek
city-state
(
polis
)
of
residence
.

If
it
had
been
borrowed
early
,
Greek
métoikos
would
become
Latin
metoecus
and
English
metecous
or
the
like
.

But
because
it
was
borrowed
when
Greek
oi
was
pronounced
as
y
(
see
Koine
Greek
phonology
)
,
it
was
transliterated
into
Latin
as
metycus
.

English
metic
replaces
y
with
i
,
perhaps
by
analogy
with
the
suffix
.

Metics
in
Classical
Athens
The
bulk
of
this
article
pertains
to
Athens
in
the
0th
and
0th
centuries
BC
during
the
Athenian
democracy
,
which
encouraged
foreigners
to
settle
in
Athens
,
on
account
of
the
part
which
they
took
in
trade
,
industry
,
education
,
art
and
of
which
period
we
have
primary
sources
about
the
specific
legal
status
of
a
Metic
,
as
reported
by
the
Attic
orators
.

However
,
the
history
of
foreign
migration
to
Athens
begins
earlier
with
Solon
,
who
is
said
to
have
offered
Athenian
citizenship
to
foreigners
who
would
relocate
to
his
city
to
practice
a
craft
;
indeed
,
in
the
period
of
Solon
,
Attic
pottery
flourished
.

In
other
Greek
cities
(
poleis
)
,
foreign
residents
were
few
,
with
the
exception
of
cosmopolitan
Corinth
,
of
which
however
we
do
not
know
their
legal
status
.

In
Sparta
and
Crete
,
as
a
general
rule
with
few
exceptions
,
foreigners
were
not
allowed
to
stay
(
Xenelasia
)
.

There
are
also
reported
immigrants
to
the
court
of
tyrants
and
kings
in
Thessaly
,
Syracuse
and
Macedon
,
whose
status
is
decided
by
the
ruler
.

So
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
legal
term
metic
should
be
associated
with
Classical
Athens
.

At
Athens
,
the
largest
city
in
the
Greek
world
at
the
time
,
they
amounted
to
roughly
half
the
free
population
.

The
status
applied
to
two
main
groups
of
people
—
immigrants
and
former
slaves
.

As
slaves
were
almost
always
of
foreign
origin
they
can
be
thought
of
as
involuntary
immigrants
,
drawn
almost
exclusively
from
non-Greek
speaking
areas
,
while
free
metics
were
usually
of
Greek
origin
.

Mostly
they
came
from
mainland
Greece
rather
than
the
remote
parts
of
the
Greek
world
.

Metics
held
lower
social
status
but
not
on
the
basis
of
socio-economic
class
.

Some
were
poor
artisans
and
ex-slaves
,
while
others
were
some
of
the
wealthiest
inhabitants
of
the
city
.

As
citizenship
was
a
matter
of
inheritance
and
not
place
of
birth
,
a
metic
could
be
either
an
immigrant
or
the
descendant
of
one
.

Regardless
of
how
many
generations
of
the
family
had
lived
in
the
city
,
metics
did
not
become
citizens
unless
the
city
chose
to
bestow
citizenship
on
them
as
a
gift
.

This
was
rarely
done
.

From
a
cultural
viewpoint
such
a
resident
could
be
completely
"
local
"
and
indistinguishable
from
citizens
.

They
had
no
role
in
the
political
community
but
might
be
completely
integrated
into
the
social
and
economic
life
of
the
city
.

In
the
urbane
scene
that
opens
Plato
's
Republic
—
the
dialogue
takes
place
in
a
metic
household
—
the
status
of
the
speakers
as
citizen
or
metic
is
never
mentioned
.

Metics
typically
shared
the
burdens
of
citizenship
without
any
of
its
privileges
.

Like
citizens
,
they
had
to
perform
military
service
and
,
if
wealthy
enough
,
were
subject
to
the
special
tax
contributions
(
eisphora
)
and
tax
services
(
"
liturgies
"
,
for
example
,
paying
for
a
warship
or
funding
a
tragic
chorus
)
contributed
by
wealthy
Athenians
.

Citizenship
at
Athens
brought
eligibility
for
numerous
state
payments
such
as
jury
and
assembly
pay
,
which
could
be
significant
to
working
people
.

During
emergencies
the
city
could
distribute
rations
to
citizens
.

None
of
these
rights
were
available
to
metics
.

They
were
not
permitted
to
own
real
estate
in
Attica
,
whether
farm
or
house
,
unless
granted
a
special
exemption
.

Neither
could
they
contract
with
the
state
to
work
the
silver
mines
,
since
the
wealth
beneath
the
earth
was
felt
to
belong
to
the
political
community
.

Further
,
they
had
to
pay
a
metic
poll
tax
,
the
metoikon
,
of
twelve
drachma
s
a
year
for
men
and
six
for
women
,
as
well
a
special
tax
(
xenikon
telos
)
if
they
wanted
to
set
up
a
stall
in
the
market
place
(
agora
)
.

Although
metics
were
barred
from
the
assembly
and
from
serving
as
jurors
,
they
did
have
the
same
access
to
the
courts
as
citizens
.

They
could
both
prosecute
others
and
be
prosecuted
themselves
.

A
great
many
migrants
came
to
Athens
to
do
business
and
were
in
fact
essential
to
the
Athenian
economy
.

It
would
have
been
a
severe
disincentive
if
they
had
been
unable
to
pursue
commercial
disputes
at
law
.

At
the
same
time
they
did
not
have
exactly
the
same
rights
here
as
citizens
.

Unlike
citizens
,
metics
could
be
made
to
undergo
judicial
torture
and
the
penalties
for
killing
them
were
not
as
severe
as
for
killing
a
citizen
.

Metics
were
also
subject
to
enslavement
for
a
variety
of
offences
.

These
might
either
be
failures
to
abide
by
their
status
obligations
,
such
as
not
paying
the
metoikon
tax
or
not
nominating
a
citizen
sponsor
,
or
they
might
be
"
contaminations
"
of
the
citizen
body
,
marrying
a
citizen
,
or
claiming
to
be
citizens
themselves
.

How
long
a
foreigner
could
remain
in
Athens
without
counting
as
a
metic
is
not
known
.

In
some
other
Greek
cities
the
period
was
a
month
,
and
it
may
well
have
been
the
same
at
Athens
.

All
metics
there
were
required
to
register
in
the
deme
(
local
community
)
where
they
lived
.

They
had
to
nominate
a
citizen
as
their
sponsor
or
guardian
(
prostates
,
literally
"
one
who
stands
on
behalf
of
"
)
.

The
Athenians
took
this
last
requirement
very
seriously
.

A
metic
without
a
sponsor
was
vulnerable
to
a
special
prosecution
.

If
convicted
,
his
property
would
be
confiscated
and
he
himself
sold
as
a
slave
.

For
a
freed
slave
the
sponsor
was
automatically
his
former
owner
.

This
arrangement
exacted
some
extra
duties
on
the
part
of
the
metic
,
yet
the
child
of
an
ex-slave
metic
apparently
had
the
same
status
as
a
freeborn
metic
.

Citizenship
was
very
rarely
granted
to
metics
.

More
common
was
the
special
status
of
"
equal
rights
"
(
isoteleia
)
under
which
they
were
freed
from
the
usual
liabilities
.

In
the
religious
sphere
all
metics
were
able
to
participate
in
the
festivals
central
to
the
life
of
the
city
,
except
for
some
roles
that
were
limited
to
citizens
.

The
status
divide
between
metic
and
citizen
was
not
always
clear
.

In
the
street
no
physical
signs
distinguished
citizen
from
metic
or
slave
.

Sometimes
the
actual
status
a
person
had
attained
became
a
contested
matter
.

Although
local
registers
of
citizens
were
kept
,
if
one
's
claim
to
citizenship
was
challenged
the
testimony
of
neighbours
and
the
community
was
decisive
.

(
In
Lysias
00
,
a
law
court
speech
,
a
man
presumed
to
be
a
metic
claims
to
be
a
citizen
,
but
upon
investigation
—
not
by
consulting
official
records
but
by
questions
asked
at
the
cheese
market
—
it
transpires
that
he
may
well
be
a
runaway
slave
,
so
the
hostile
account
attests
.
)

Metics
whose
family
had
lived
in
Athens
for
generations
may
have
been
tempted
to
"
pass
"
as
citizens
.

On
a
number
of
occasions
there
were
purges
of
the
citizen
lists
,
effectively
changing
people
who
had
been
living
as
citizens
into
metics
.

In
typical
Athenian
fashion
,
a
person
so
demoted
could
mount
a
challenge
in
court
.

If
however
the
court
decided
the
ejected
citizen
was
in
fact
a
metic
,
he
would
be
sent
down
one
further
rung
and
sold
into
slavery
.

In
studying
the
status
of
the
metics
it
is
easy
to
gain
the
impression
they
were
an
oppressed
minority
.

But
by
and
large
those
who
were
Greek
and
freeborn
had
at
least
chosen
to
come
to
Athens
,
attracted
by
the
prosperity
of
the
large
,
dynamic
,
cosmopolitan
city
and
the
opportunities
not
available
to
them
in
their
place
of
origin
.

Metics
remained
citizens
of
their
cities
of
birth
,
which
,
like
Athens
,
had
the
exclusionary
ancestral
view
of
citizenship
common
to
ancient
Greek
cities
.

The
large
non-citizen
community
of
Athens
allowed
ex-slave
metics
to
become
assimilated
in
a
way
not
possible
in
more
conservative
and
homogenised
cities
elsewhere
.

Their
participation
in
military
service
,
tax
ation
(
for
the
rich
at
Athens
a
matter
of
public
display
and
pride
)
and
cult
must
have
given
them
a
sense
of
involvement
in
the
city
,
and
of
their
value
to
it
.

Though
notably
,
while
Athenians
tended
to
refer
to
metics
by
their
name
and
deme
of
residence
(
the
same
democratic
scheme
used
for
citizens
)
,
on
their
tombstones
freeborn
metics
who
died
in
Athens
preferred
to
name
the
cities
from
which
they
had
come
and
of
which
they
were
citizens
still
.

Aftermath
The
term
Metic
began
to
lose
its
distinctive
legal
status
in
0th
century
BC
,
when
metics
were
allowed
to
act
in
the
court
without
a
Prostates
(
patron
)
and
came
to
an
end
in
Hellenistic
Athens
,
when
the
purchase
of
citizenship
became
very
frequent
.

The
census
of
Demetrius
Phalereus
in
ca.
000
BC
gave
00,000
citizens
,
00,000
metics
and
000,000
slaves
(

.

In
the
Greco-Roman
world
,
free
people
(
non-citizens
)
living
on
the
territory
of
a
polis
were
called
"
paroikoi
"
(

,
in

"

Modern
France
The
French
translation
métèque
has
modernly
acquired
a
pejorative
meaning
,
being
applied
against
Mediterranean
immigrant
s
,
as
in
the
works
of
Charles
Maurras
.

According
to
Nicole
Loraux
,
who
compares
Athens
and
Paris
,
it
was
probably
better
to
be
an
Athenian
Metic
,
than
an
immigrant
in
0000s
France
.

Biblical
parallel
The
Bible
makes
numerous
references
to
a
class
of
people
known
as
"
gerim
"
(
גרים
)
(
"
ger
"
גר
in
singular
)
,
a
class
of
people
of
different
origin
living
permanently
in
the
country
of
others
.

They
had
clearly
demarcated
rights
,
and
the
Hebrews
are
sternly
and
repeatedly
enjoined
to
treat
them
fairly
and
keep
in
mind
that
that
they
themselves
were
in
the
same
situation
when
living
in
Egypt
.

(
"
וְגֵר
לֹא
תוֹנֶה
וְלֹא
תִלְחָצֶנּוּ
כִּי
גֵרִים
הֱיִיתֶם
בְּאֶרֶץ
מִצְרָיִם
.
"

Book
of
Exodus
00
,
00
)
Also
etymologically
they
are
similar
to
the
Greek
metics
,
"
ger
"
being
derived
from
the
Hebrew
root
for
"
to
dwell
"
,
i.e.
they
were
"
the
dwellers
[
among
us
]
"
.

The
term
"
strangers
"
used
in
the
King
James
Bible
and
other
English
translations
(
for
example
,
"
Love
ye
therefore
the
stranger
:
for
ye
were
strangers
in
the
land
of
Egypt
"
in
Deuteronomy
00
,
00
)
does
not
fully
convey
these
connotations
.

In
modern
Hebrew
,
"
ger
"
has
come
to
mean
a
convert
to
Judaism
.

both
domestic
and
foreign
causes
.

Upon
formation
it
only
consisted
of
the
provinces

Demography

is
sparsely
populated
and
more
than
one
third
of
the
population
live
on
the
countryside
,
making
Jämtland
County
the
second
largest
rural
region
in

district/countryside
"
.

Politics
The
county
is
dominated
by
the
Swedish
Social
Democratic
Party
and
the
Swedish
Rural
Centre
Party
,
which

unique
in
Sweden
,
but
corresponds
to
the
situation
in
the
bordering
Norwegian
county
of
Nord-Trøndelag
.

The
county
is
rather
contrastive
in
the
political
field

governed
by
liberal

conservative
(

Östersund
Municipality
(
)
is
a
municipality
in
Jämtland
County
in
northern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
Östersund
,
which
is
also
the
county
seat
of
Jämtland
County
.

The
present
municipality
was
formed
in
0000
by
the
amalgamation
of
the
City
of
Östersund
with
five
surrounding
rural
municipalities
.

Localities
There
are
ten
localities
(
or
urban
areas
)
in
Östersund
Municipality
:

Politics
and
governance
Swedish
municipalities
are
responsible
for
government-mandated
duties
,
and
elections
for
the
municipal
council
(
kommunfullmäktige
)
are
held
every
four
years
,
parallel
to
the
general
election
s.
Political
history
Östersund
gained
a
city
council
(
stadsfullmäktige
)
in
0000
,
known
as
Östersunds
stad
,
and
each
member
was
elected
through
a
single-winner
voting
system
.

Sweden
was
democratized
in
the
end
of
the
0000s
and
a
more
parliament
arian
election
system
was
introduced
.

Östersund
continued
to
be
governed
by
the
burghers
,
unlike
Sweden
nationally
.

The
dominating
parties
were
the
conservatives
,
the
freeminded
and
the
social
democrats
.

The
latter
did
become
the
single
largest
party
in
0000
but
due
to
a
strong
centre-right
majority
it
remained
in
opposition
.

The
only
other
party
present
in
Östersund
was
the
communists
,
though
they
had
little
support
in
the
city
,
having
entered
the
city
council
in
0000
and
lost
representation
completely
in
0000
.

The
conservatives
was
by
far
the
largest
party
and
had
a
majority
of
its
own
with
00
seats
in
0000
.

After
the
municipal
elections
of
0000
the
situation
had
changed
.

The
conservatives
was
the
smallest
party
with
00
seats
,
the
liberals
(
now
represented
by
the
Liberal
People
's
party
)
had
00
and
the
social
democrats
00
.

This
was
in
contrast
to
the
turnout
on
a
national
level
,
where
the
social
democrats
had
been
the
dominant
party
for
over
a
decade
gaining
e.g.
00
percent
of
the
votes
in
the
general
elections
of
0000
.

In
0000
a
social
democrat
was
appointed
chairman
of
Östersund
's
governing
body
,
due
to
the
lack
of
political
blocs
and
the
strive
for
mutual
agreements
.

A
majority
for
the
social
democrats
was
achieved
first
in
0000
.

The
political
scene
was
shortly
afterwards
altered
,
in
0000
,
when
the
agrian
and
rural
Centre
Party
(
previously
known
as
Peasant
's
League
)
got
into
the
city
council
,
after
broadening
its
scope
to
include
non-farmers
,
alongside
the
Christian
Democrats
(
though
not
present
on
the
national
political
scene
)
and
the
communists
returning
after
a
00
year
period
of
absence
.

The
burghers
was
thus
back
in
power
.

Following
the
rise
of
Swedish
welfare
the
small
municipalities
could
not
cope
with
their
assigned
duties
.

As
a
result
large
municipality
blocks
were
introduced
and
Östersunds
stad
was
heavily
enlarged
and
several
districts
kilometres
away
from
the
city
were
included
in
the
new
Östersund
Municipality
.

The
first
election
for
the
new
municipality
was
held
in
0000
and
it
was
a
large
success
for
the
Centre
Party
,
both
locally
in
Östersund
and
nationally
due
to
its
opposition
towards
centralisation
.

Having
entered
in
0000
with
0
seats
it
now
possessed
one
fourth
of
the
total
number
of
seats
(
which
was
mainly
due
to
support
from
the
city
,
not
the
newly
included
rural
areas
)
.

Block
politics
formation
became
prominent
and
the
Centre
Party
became
the
leading
party
for
the
centre-right
block
,
whilst
the
Social
Democrats
came
to
dominate
the
left
block
.

The
Social
Democrats
regained
power
in
0000
and
has
since
governed
Östersund
Municipality
until
present
day
(
excluding
a
brief
period
in
the
0000s
)
supported
by
the
communists
(
after
0000
knows
an
the
Left
Party
)
and
occasionally
the
Green
Party
.

The
Green
Party
has
been
in
the
municipal
council
since
0000
.

0000
elections
In
preparation
for
the
0000
municipal
elections
the
centre-right
parties
in
the
opposition
were
joined
,
following
the
example
done
nationally
with
Alliance
for
Sweden
as
Alliance
for
Östersund
.

The
Green
Party
did
not
want
to
pick
a
side
between
the
Alliance
and
the
ruling
left
block
.

This
later
gave
the
Green
Party
the
opportunity
to
support
either
side
.

After
negotiations
the
party
chose
to
support
the
left
block
,
just
like
it
did
0000-0000
.

Jens
Nilsson
from
the
Social
Democratic
Party
is
the
mayor
of
Östersund
and
has
been
so
since
0000
.

Mönsterås
Municipality
(
Mönsterås
kommun
)
is
a
municipality
in
Kalmar
County
,
south-eastern
Sweden
,
with
its
seat
located
in
the
town
Mönsterås
.

Mönsterås
was
an
original
market
town
köping
,
which
in
0000
was
united
with
the
rural
municipality
by
the
same
name
.

By
the
local
government
reform
of
0000
it
became
a
municipality
of
unitary
type
and
amalgamated
with
Fliseryd
and
Ålem
in
0000
.

The
coastal
line
is
signified
by
an
archipelago
with
some
000
islands
and
islets
,
whereof
two
are
nature
reserve
s.
On
the
island
farthest
from
land
,
the
lighthouse
of
Dämman
was
built
in
0000
;
an
automatic
lighthouse
has
replaced
its
function
,
but
the
house
itself
is
visited
by
tourists
and
conferences
.

The
geography
of
the
rest
is
by
some
parts
covered
with
forests
,
as
the
Småland
province
generally
is
.

There
is
also
some
agricultural
areas
closer
to
the
sea
.

There
are
two
rivers
flowing
through
the
municipality
towards
to
sea
:
Emån
and
Alsterån
,
that
designate
the
wildlife
and
geography
.

The
municipal
arms
show
the
ridge
which
the
town
centre
with
its
church
has
been
situated
on
since
the
medieval
age
.

The
cross
symbolizes
the
Knights
Hospitallers
,
a
monastic
order
that
was
built
in
the
town
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
had
a
large
influence
on
its
development
.

It
is
an
etymological

Mörbylånga
Municipality
(
Mörbylånga
kommun
)
is
a
municipality
in
Kalmar
County
,
in
south-eastern
Sweden
,
located
on
the
island
of
Öland
in
the
Baltic
Sea
.

The
seat
is
located
in
the
town
of
Mörbylånga
,
while
the
largest
town
is
Färjestaden
.

The
present
municipality
,
making
up
the
southern
part
of
Öland
,
was
formed
in
0000
.

The
eighteen
original
entities
(
as
of
0000
)
had
during
the
nation-wide
subdivision
reform
of
0000
been
regrouped
into
three
larger
units
.

Ottenby
was
amalgamated
with
Mörbylånga
in
0000
and
0000
Torslunda
was
added
.

Mörbylånga
Municipality
contains
several
ancient
remains
,
just
like
the
northern
Öland
municipality
of
Borgholm
.

All
in
all
,
there
are
about
00
hillfort
s
on
Öland
.

The
most
notable
in
southern
Öland
is
the
fortress
Eketorp
.

The
entire
southern
part
of
the
island
has
been
listed
as
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
,
basically
the
whole
municipality
of
Mörbylånga
.

The
reason
is
that
the
climate
and
bedrock
has
made
the
area
populated
and
cultivated
for
several
thousands
of
years
.

Unlike
the
geology
on
the
eastern
mainland
province
of
Småland
there
are
scarcely
any
forests
on
Öland
,
so
people
can
conduct
agriculture
.

The
southern
parts
of
Öland
also
contain
certain
wildlife
areas
.

Many
migratory
bird
s
halt
here
on
their
way
north
or
south
.

Especially
the
southernmost
outpost
,
the
lighthouse
Långe
Jan
(
Tall
John
)
is
visited
by
many
birdwatcher
s
every
day
,
as
many
birds
flock
here
until
setting
away
over
the
ocean
.

One
fourth
of
the
municipality
consists
of
the
nature
area
,
Stora
Alvaret
,
a
unique
alvar
nature
area
containing
by
many
endemic
and
rare
plants
not
found
anywhere
else

One
can

several

kommun
)
is
a
municipality
in
Kalmar
County
,
south-eastern
Sweden
,
with
its
seat
in

Nybro
.

The

of
the
City
of
Nybro
(
instituted
in
0000
)
with
its
surrounding
municipalities
took
place
in
0000
.

The
municipality
was
inhabited
by
a
few
hundred
people
until
the
railways
came
in
the
late
00th
century
,
and
the
town
Nybro
was
in

coast
and
Gothenburg
on
the
west
coast
;
later
also
on
the
railway
from
Kalmar
and
Malmö
in
the
south-west
.

Until
then
Nybro
mostly
consisted
of
minor
industries
,
marked
by
its
traditionally
Småland
forest
nature
,
largely
unsuitable
for
any
agriculture
.

The
most
notable
were
a
match
factory
;
apart
from
that
Nybro
was
also
the
easternmost
part
of
the
Glasriket
,
Kingdom
of
Crystal
,
that
covers
a
total
of
four
