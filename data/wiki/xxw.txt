in

County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Founded
in
0000
,
Jacobus
was
originally
called
New
Paradise
.

The
name
was
later
changed
because
of
misdelivered
mail
between
New
Paradise
and
the
town
of
Paradise
,
Pennsylvania
in
neighboring
Lancaster
County
.

The
name
Jacobus
(
jă-KŌ-bŭs
)
was
derived
from
the
name
of
the
town
's
postmaster
,
Jacob
Geiselman
(
0000-0000
)
.

To
correct
the
problem
of
the
misdelivered
mail
,
the
United
States
Post
Office
Department
notified
Geiselman
to
change
the
name
of
the
post
office
.

However
,
Geiselman
was
unable
to
think
of
another
name
.

Therefore
,
the
mail
was
sorted
and
forwarded
to
Geiselman
labeled
as
,
"
Jacob-US
Mail
;
"
which
was
later
shortened
to
"
Jacob-US
.
"

The
post
office
was
then
renamed
Jacobus
,
and
the
town
was
renamed
accordingly
.

In
0000
,
Jacobus
became
an
incorporated

History
Early
settlement
The
lands
in
and
around
the
borough
of
Lewisberry
were
under
control
of
the
Susquehannock
people
until
the
first
Quaker
settlements
in
the
0000s
.

These
settlements
were
among
the
first
Quaker
settlements
in
America
west
of
the
Susquehanna
River
.

Among
the
group
of
original
titleholders
along
the
small
creek
that
would
become
known
as
Bennett
Run
were
Ellis
Lewis
,
Joseph
Bennett
,
John
Heald
,
and
John
Hall
.

At
this
time
,
the
area
that
would
become
York
County
was
still
almost
entirely
populated
by
the
Susquehannock
Indians
.

Yet
there
are
few
recorded
conflicts
between
these
early
settlers
and
the
native
population
.

In
this
area
that
would
later
become
majority
Pennsylvania
German
,
the
first
and
second
waves
of
settlers
were
almost
entirely
English
speakers
and
included
the
Kirks
,
Rankins
,
Huttons
,
Garetsons
,
Nebingers
,
Eppleys
,
Starrs
,
Fosters
,
Clines
,
Stromingers
,
Moores
,
Frankelbergers
,
Suttons
,
Wickershams
,
Prowells
,
Millers
,
and
Hammonds
.

While
most
were
Quakers
,
a
significant
minority
were
Anglican
s.
The
Quaker
meeting
house
at
the
intersection
of
Old
Quaker
and
Lewisberry
roads
(
PA

)
is
the
original
Quaker
meeting
house
in
the
area
.

Founding
of
borough
The
borough
's
founder
,
Eli
Lewis
,
was
born
nearby
in
0000
,
the
son
of
one
of
the
original
settlers
,
Ellis
Lewis
.

On
the
eve
of
the
American
Revolution
,
Eli
opened
a
store
on
the
site
of
the
current
borough
.

Lewis
and
members
of
other
prominent
families
in
the
area
served
in
the
Pennsylvania
militia
,
and
Eli
rose
to
the
rank
of
major
.

Over
the
course
of
the
war
,
the
town
became
known
for
producing
guns
,
and
the
Committee
of
Safety
for
York
County
contracted
with
area
gunsmiths
to
supply
the
Continental
Army
;
guns
made
in
Lewisberry
were
in
use
by
the
US
Army
as
late
as
the
Siege
of
Veracruz
during
the
Mexican
–
American
War
of
0000
.

Following
the
Revolutionary
War
,
Lewis
'
fortune
grew
(
and
he
eventually
owned
000
acres
in
the
area
)
and
his
store
was
the
center
of
commerce
in
the
Redland
Valley
.

In
0000
,
Issac
Kirk
surveyed
twelve
acres
of
land
and
laid
out
lots
for
Lewis
,
who
wanted
a
town
to
exist
on
the
site
.

While
all
of
the
lots
were
not
immediately
sold
,
many
were
,
and
the

began
a
modest
growth
.

Between

0000
,
Major

had
lived
in
Harrisburg
,
where
he
took
up
printing
and
published

newspaper
,
The
Advertiser
,
which
was
then
sold
to
John
Wyeth
,
who
renamed
it
The
Oracle
of
Dauphin
.

While

,
Lewis
also
published
the

poem
,
"
St.
Clair
's
Defeat
,
"

mill
on
the
west

Andrew
Cline
,
who
ran
a
large
and
successful
milling
business
during
the
second
half
of
the
00th
century
.

The
mill
and
house
are
still
standing
just
outside
of
the
borough
beside
Silver
Lake
,
which
was
created
to
power
the
mill
.

One
of
Lewisberry
's
most
important
small
industries
during
the
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
was
the

of
block
brimstone
matches
,
and
the
families
of
Lyman
Lewis
,
Herman
Kirk
,
Moses
Magrew
,
Rt.
.

Starr
,
and
Lyman
Shettle
became
prosperous
through
this
industry
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
Joseph
Potts
manufactured
the
area
's
first
coffee
mill
s
out
of
his
home
.

This
industry
grew
under
his
children
,
and
by
the
middle
of
the
century
,
Lewisberry
was
producing
large
numbers
of
coffee
grinders
in
a
small
factory
near
the
Quaker
meeting
house
.

In
0000
,
William
Smith
started
a
newspaper
in
the
bustling
town
.

In
0000
,
Lewisberry
native
Hervey
Hammond
began
manufacture
of
the
patented
Hammond
window
sash
spring
,
and
in
0000
,
President
Martin
Van
Buren
installed
Hammond
springs
in
all
of
the
White
House
's
windows
.

Serfdom
is
the
status
of
peasants
under
feudalism
,
specifically
relating
to
manorialism
.

It
was
a
condition
of
bondage
or
modified
slavery
which
developed
primarily
during
the
High
Middle
Ages
in
Europe
and
lasted
in
some
countries
until
the
mid-00th
century
.

Serfs
who
occupied
a
plot
of
land
were
required
to
work
for
the
Lord
of
the
Manor
who
owned
that
land
,
and
in
return
were
entitled
to
protection
,
justice
and
the
right
to
exploit
certain
fields
within
the
manor
to
maintain
their
own
subsistence
.

Serfs
were
often
required
not
only
to
work
on
the
lord
's
fields
,
but
also
his
mines
,
forests
and
roads
.

The
manor
formed
the
basic
unit
of
feudal
society
and
the
Lord
of
the
Manor
and
his
serfs
were
bound
legally
,
economically
,
and
socially
.

Serfs
formed
the
lowest
social
class
of
feudal
society
.

The
decline
of
serfdom
in
Western
Europe
has
sometimes
been
attributed
to
the
Black
Death
,
which
reached
Europe
in
0000
,
although
the
decline
had
begun
before
that
date
.

Although
serfdom
became
increasingly
rare
in
most
of
Western
Europe
after
the
Renaissance
,
it
grew
strong
in
Central
and
Eastern
Europe
,
where
it
had
previously
been
less
common
(
this
phenomenon
was
known
as
"
later
serfdom
"
)
.

In
Eastern
Europe
the
institution
persisted
until
the
mid-00th
century
.

It
persisted
in
the
Austrian
Empire
till
0000
and
was
abolished
in
Russia
in
0000
.

In
Finland
,
Norway
and
Sweden
feudalism
was
not
established
,
and
serfdom
did
not
exist
;
however
,
serfdom-like
institutions
did
exist
in
both
Denmark
(
the
stavnsbånd
,
from
0000
to
0000
)
and
its
vassal
Iceland
(
the
more
restrictive
vistarband
,
from
0000
until
0000
)
.

According
to
Joseph
R.
Strayer
,
the
concept
of
feudalism
can
also
be
applied
to
the
societies
of
ancient
Persia
,
ancient
Mesopotamia
,
Egypt
(
Sixth
to
Twelfth
dynasty
)
,
Muslim
India
,
China
(
Zhou
Dynasty
,
and
end
of
Han
Dynasty
)
and
Japan
during
the
Shogunate
.

James
Lee
and
Cameron
Campbell
describe
the
Chinese
Qing
Dynasty
(
0000
–
0000
)
as
also
maintaining
a
form
of
serfdom
.

Tibet
is
described
by
Melvyn
Goldstein
to
have
had
serfdom
until
0000
,
but
whether
or
not
the
Tibetan
form
of
peasant
tenancy
qualified
as
serfdom
was
widespread
is
contested
.

Bhutan
is
described
by
Tashi
Wangchuk
,
a
Bhutanese
civil
servant
,
as
abolishing
serfdom
officially
by
0000
,
but
Wangchuk
believes
less
than
or
about
00
%
of
poor
peasants
were
in
copyhold
situations
.

United
Nations
0000
Supplementary
Convention
on
the
Abolition
of
Slavery
also
prohibits
serfdom
as
a
form
of
slavery
.

Etymology
The
word
"
serf
"
originated
from
the
Middle
French
serf
,
and
can
be
traced
further
back
to
the
Latin
servus
(
"
slave
"
)
.

In
Late
Antiquity
and
most
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
what
we
now
call
serfs
were
usually
designated
in
Latin
as
coloni
.

As
slavery
gradually
disappeared
and
the
legal
status
of
servi
became
nearly
identical
to
that
of
the
coloni
,
the
term
changed
meaning
into
our
modern
concept
of
"
serf
"
.
"

Serfdom
"
was
coined
in
0000
.

Dependency
and
the
lower
orders
Serfs
had
a
specific
place
in
feudal
society
,
as
did
baron
s
and
knight
s
:
in
return
for
protection
,
a
serf
would
reside
upon
and
work
a
parcel
of
land
within
the
manor
of
his
lord
.

There
was
thus
a
degree
of
reciprocity
in
the
manorial
system
.

One
rationale
was
that
a
serf
"
worked
for
all
,
"
while
a
knight
or
baron
"
fought
for
all
"
and
a
churchman
"
prayed
for
all
"
;
thus
everyone
had
a
place
.

The
serf
was
the
worst
fed
and
paid
,
but
at
least
he
had
his
place
and
,
unlike
slaves
,
had
certain
rights
in
land
and
property
.

A
lord
of
the
manor
could
not
sell
his
serfs
as
a
Roman
might
sell
his
slaves
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
he
chose
to
dispose
of
a
parcel
of
land
,
the
serfs
associated
with
that
land
stayed
with
it
to
serve
their
new
lord
,
benefitting
him
from
their
long-acquired
knowledge
of
practices
suited
to
the
land
.

Further
,
a
serf
could
not
abandon
his
lands
without
permission
,
nor
did
he
possess
a
saleable
title
in
them
.

Becoming
a
serf
A
freeman
became
a
serf
usually
through
force
or
necessity
.

Sometimes
freeholders
or
allodial
owners
were
intimidated
into
dependency
by
the
greater
physical
and
legal
force
of
a
local
magnate
.

Often
a
few
years
of
crop
failure
,
a
war
,
or
brigandage
might
leave
a
person
unable
to
make
his
own
way
.

In
such
a
case
a
bargain
was
struck
with
a
lord
of
a
manor
.

In
exchange
for
protection
,
service
was
required
,
in
cash
,
produce
or
labour
,
or
a
combination
of
all
.

These
bargains
were
formalized
in
a
ceremony
known
as
"
bondage
"
in
which
a
serf
placed
his
head
in
the
lord
's
hands
,
akin
to
the
ceremony
of
homage
where
a
vassal
placed
his
hands
between
those
of
his
overlord
.

These
oaths
bound
the
lord
and
his
new
serf
in
a
feudal
contract
and
defined
the
terms
of
their
agreement
.

Often
these
bargains
were
severe
.

A
0th
century
Anglo
Saxon
"
Oath
of
Fealty
"
states
:
To
become
a
serf
was
a
commitment
that
encompassed
all
aspects
of
the
serf
’s
life
.

Moreover
,
the
condition
of
serfdom
was
inherited
at
birth
.

By
taking
on
the
duties
of
serfdom
,
serfs
bound
not
only
themselves
but
all
of
their
future
progeny
.

Serfdom
's
class
system
The
social
class
of
peasant
was
often
broken
down
into
smaller
categories
.

These
distinctions
were
often
less
clear
than
suggested
by
their
different
names
.

Most
often
,
there
were
two
types
of
peasants
,
freemen
,
whose
tenure
within
the
manor
was
freehold
,
and
villein
s.
Lower
classes
of
peasants
,
known
as
cottar
s
,
generally
comprising
the
younger
sons
of
villeins
or
bordar
s
in
the
British
Isles
,
and
slaves
,
made
up
the
lower
class
of
workers
.

FreemenFreemen
,
or
free
tenants
held
their
land
by
one
of
a
variety
of
contracts
of
feudal
land
tenure
and
were
essentially
rent-paying
tenant
farmers
who
owed
little
or
no
service
to
the
lord
,
and
had
a
good
degree
of
security
of
tenure
and
independence
.

In
parts
of
00th
century
England
freemen
made
up
only
00
%
of
the
peasant
population
,
and
in
the
rest
of
Europe
their
numbers
were
small
.

VilleinsA
villein
(
or
villain
)
was
the
most
common
type
of
serf
in
the
Middle
Ages
.

Villeins
had
more
rights
and
higher
status
than
the
lowest
serf
,
but
existed
under
a
number
of
legal
restrictions
that
differentiated
them
from
freemen
.

Villeins
generally
rented
small
homes
,
with
or
without
land
.

As
part
of
the
contract
with
the
landlord
,
the
lord
of
the
manor
,
they
were
expected
to
spend
some
of
their
time
working
on
the
lord
's
fields
.

The
requirement
often
was
not
greatly
onerous
,
contrary
to
popular
belief
,
and
was
often
only
seasonal
,
for
example
the
duty
to
help
at
harvest-time
.

The
rest
of
their
time
was
spent
farming
their
own
land
for
their
own
profit
.

Like
other
types
of
serfs
,
they
were
required
to
provide
other
services
,
possibly
in
addition
to
paying
rent
of
money
or
produce
.

Villeins
were
tied
to
the
land
and
could
not
move
away
without
their
lord
's
consent
and
the
acceptance
of
the
lord
to
whose
manor
they
proposed
to
migrate
to
.

Villeins
were
generally
able
to
hold
their
own
property
,
unlike
slaves
.

Villeinage
,
as
opposed
to
other
forms
of
serfdom
,
was
most
common
in
Continental
European
feudalism
,
where
land
ownership
had
developed
from
roots
in
Roman
law
.

A
variety
of
kinds
of
villeinage
existed
in
Europe
in
the
Middle
Ages
.

Half-villeins
received
only
half
as
many
strips
of
land
for
their
own
use
and
owed
a
full
complement
of
labour
to
the
lord
,
often
forcing
them
to
rent
out
their
services
to
other
serfs
to
make
up
for
this
hardship
.

Villeinage
was
not
,
however
,
a
purely
uni-directional
exploitative
relationship
.

In
the
Middle
Ages
,
land
within
a
lord
's
manor
provided
sustenance
and
survival
,
and
being
a
villein
guaranteed
access
to
land
,
and
crops
secure
from
theft
by
marauding
robbers
.

Landlords
,
even
where
legally
entitled
to
do
so
,
rarely
evicted
villeins
because
of
the
value
of
their
labour
.

Villeinage
was
much
preferable
to
being
a
vagabond
,
a
slave
,
or
an
unlanded
labourer
.

In
many
medieval
countries
,
a
villein
could
gain
freedom
by
escaping
from
a
manor
to
a
city
or
borough
and
living
there
for
more
than
a
year
;
but
this
action
involved
the
loss
of
land
rights
and
agricultural
livelihood
,
a
prohibitive
price
unless
the
landlord
was
especially
tyrannical
or
conditions
in
the
village
were
unusually
difficult
.

Bordars
and
cottagersIn
England
the
Domesday
Book
,
of
0000
,
uses
bordarii
(
bordar
)
and
cottarii
(
cottager
)
as
interchangeable
terms
,
cottager
being
derived
from
the
native
tongue
whereas
bordar
being
derived
from
the
French
.

The
status
of
bordar
or
cottager
ranked
below
a
serf
in
the
social
hierarchy
of
a
manor
,
holding
a
cottage
,
garden
and
just
enough
land
to
feed
a
family
.

In
England
,
at
the
time
of
the
Domesday
Survey
,
this
would
have
been
between
about
0
and
0
acres
(
0.0
to
0
hectares
)
.

Under
an
Elizabethan
statute
,
the
cottage
had
to
be
built
with
at
least
of
land
.

However
,
the
later
Enclosures
Act
removed
the
cottagers
'
right
to
any
land
:
"
before
the
Enclosures
Act
the
cottager
was
a
farm
labourer
with
land
and
after
the
Enclosures
Act
the
cottager
was
a
farm
labourer
without
land
"
.

The
bordars
and
cottagers
did
not
own
their
draught
oxen
or
horses
.

The
Domesday
Book
showed
that
England
comprised
00
%
freeholders
,
00
%
serfs
or
villeins
,
00
%
cotters
and
borders
,
and
0
%
slaves
.

SlavesThe
last
type
of
serf
was
the
slave
.

Slaves
had
the
fewest
rights
and
benefits
from
the
manor
.

They
owned
no
tenancy
in
land
,
worked
for
the
lord
exclusively
and
survived
on
donations
from
the
landlord
.

It
was
always
in
the
interest
of
the
lord
to
prove
that
a
servile
arrangement
existed
,
as
this
provided
him
with
greater
rights
to
fees
and
taxes
.

The
status
of
a
man
was
a
primary
issue
in
determining
a
person
's
rights
and
obligations
in
many
of
the
manorial
court
cases
of
the
period
.

Also
,
runaway
slaves
could
be
beaten
if
caught
.

The
serf
's
duties
The
usual
serf
(
not
including
slaves
or
cottars
)
paid
his
fees
and
taxes
in
the
form
of
seasonally
appropriate
labour
.

Usually
a
portion
of
the
week
was
devoted
to
ploughing
his
lord
's
fields
held
in
demesne
,
harvesting
crops
,
digging
ditches
,
repairing
fences
,
and
often
working
in
the
manor
house
.

The
remainder
of
the
serf
’s
time
was
devoted
to
tending
his
own
fields
,
crops
and
animals
in
order
to
provide
for
his
family
.

Most
manorial
work
was
segregated
by
gender
during
the
regular
times
of
the
year
;
however
,
during
the
harvest
,
the
whole
family
was
expected
to
work
the
fields
.

A
major
difficulty
of
a
serf
's
life
was
that
his
work
for
his
lord
coincided
with
,
and
took
precedence
over
,
the
work
he
had
to
perform
on
his
own
lands
:
when
the
lord
's
crops
were
ready
to
be
harvested
,
so
were
his
own
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
serf
of
a
benign
lord
could
look
forward
to
being
well
fed
during
his
service
;
it
was
a
lord
without
foresight
who
did
not
provide
a
substantial
meal
for
his
serfs
during
the
harvest
and
planting
times
.

In
exchange
for
this
work
on
the
lord
's
demesne
,
the
serf
had
certain
privileges
and
rights
,
including
for
example
the
right
to
gather
deadwood
from
their
lord
’s
forests
,
an
essential
fuel
source
.

In
addition
to
service
,
a
serf
was
required
to
pay
certain
taxes
and
fees
.

Taxes
were
based
on
the
assessed
value
of
his
lands
and
holdings
.

Fees
were
usually
paid
in
the
form
of
agricultural
produce
rather
than
cash
.

The
best
ration
of
wheat
from
the
serf
’s
harvest
often
went
to
the
landlord
.

Generally
hunting
and
trapping
of
wild
game
by
the
serfs
on
the
lord
’s
property
was
prohibited
.

On
Easter
Sunday
the
peasant
family
perhaps
might
owe
an
extra
dozen
eggs
,
and
at
Christmas
a
goose
was
perhaps
required
too
.

When
a
family
member
died
,
extra
taxes
were
paid
to
the
lord
as
a
form
of
feudal
relief
to
enable
the
heir
to
keep
the
right
to
till
what
land
he
had
.

Any
young
woman
who
wished
to
marry
a
serf
outside
of
her
manor
was
forced
to
pay
a
fee
for
the
right
to
leave
her
lord
,
and
in
compensation
for
her
lost
labour
.

Often
there
were
arbitrary
tests
to
judge
the
worthiness
of
their
tax
payments
.

A
chicken
,
for
example
,
might
be
required
to
be
able
to
jump
over
a
fence
of
a
given
height
to
be
considered
old
enough
or
well
enough
to
be
valued
for
tax
purposes
.

The
restraints
of
serfdom
on
personal
and
economic
choice
were
enforced
through
various
forms
of
manorial
customary
law
and
the
manorial
administration
and
court
baron
.

It
was
also
a
matter
of
discussion
whether
serfs
could
be
required
by
law
in
times
of
war
or
conflict
to
fight
for
their
lord
's
land
and
property
.

In
the
case
of
their
lord
's
defeat
,
their
own
fate
might
be
uncertain
,
so
the
serf
certainly
had
an
interest
in
supporting
his
lord
.

Rights
of
serfdom
Within
his
constraints
,
a
serf
had
some
freedoms
.

Though
the
common
wisdom
is
that
a
serf
owned
"
only
his
belly
"
—
even
his
clothes
were
the
property
,
in
law
,
of
his
lord
—
a
serf
might
still
accumulate
personal
property
and
wealth
,
and
some
serfs
became
wealthier
than
their
free
neighbours
,
although
this
was
rare
.

A
well-to-do
serf
might
even
be
able
to
buy
his
freedom
.

A
serf
could
grow
what
crop
he
saw
fit
on
his
lands
,
although
a
serf
's
taxes
often
had
to
be
paid
in
wheat
.

The
surplus
he
would
sell
at
market
.

The
landlord
could
not
dispossess
his
serfs
without
legal
cause
and
was
supposed
to
protect
them
from
the
depredations
of
robbers
or
other
lords
,
and
he
was
expected
to
support
them
by
charity
in
times
of
famine
.

Many
such
rights
were
enforceable
by
the
serf
in
the
manorial
court
.

Variations
Forms
of
serfdom
varied
greatly
through
time
and
region
.

In
some
places
serfdom
was
merged
with
or
exchanged
for
various
forms
of
taxation
.

The
amount
of
labour
required
varied
.

In
Poland
,
for
example
,
it
was
commonly
a
few
days
per
year
per
household
in
the
00th
century
;
one
day
per
week
per
household
in
the
00th
century
;
four
days
per
week
per
household
in
the
00th
century
and
six
days
per
week
per
household
in
the
00th
century
.

Early
serfdom
in
Poland
was
mostly
limited
on
the
royal
territories
(
królewszczyzny
)
.
"

Per
household
"
means
that
every
dwelling
had
to
give
a
worker
for
the
required
number
of
days
.

For
example
,
in
the
00th
century
,
six
people
:
a
peasant
,
his
wife
,
three
children
and
a
hired
worker
might
be
required
to
work
for
their
lord
one
day
a
week
,
which
would
be
counted
as
six
days
of
labour
.

Serfs
served
on
occasion
as
soldiers
in
the
event
of
conflict
and
could
earn
freedom
or
even
ennoblement
for
valour
in
combat
.

Serfs
could
purchase
their
freedom
,
be
manumitted
by
their
generous
owners
,
or
flee
to
towns
or
newly-settled
land
where
few
questions
were
asked
.

Laws
varied
from
country
to
country
:
in
England
a
serf
who
made
his
way
to
a
chartered
town
(
i.e.
a
borough
)
and
evaded
recapture
for
a
year
and
a
day
obtained
his
freedom
and
became
a
burgher
of
the
town
.

History
of
serfdom
Social
institutions
similar
to
serfdom
were
known
in
ancient
times
.

The
status
of
the
helots
in
the
ancient
Greek
city-state
of
Sparta
resembled
that
of
the
medieval
serfs
.

By
the
0rd
century
AD
,
the
Roman
Empire
faced
a
labour
shortage
.

Large
Roman
landowners
increasingly
relied
on
Roman
freemen
,
acting
as
tenant
farmers
,
instead
of
slaves
to
provide
labour
.

These
tenant
farmers
,
eventually
known
as
coloni
,
saw
their
condition
steadily
erode
.

Because
the
tax
system
implemented
by
Dioclecian
assessed
taxes
based
on
both
land
and
the
inhabitants
of
that
land
,
it
became
administratively
inconvenient
for
peasants
to
leave
the
land
where
they
were
counted
in
the
census
.

However
,
medieval
serfdom
really
began
with
the
breakup
of
the
Carolingian
Empire
around
the
00th
century
.

During
this
period
,
powerful
feudal
lords
encouraged
the
establishment
of
serfdom
as
a
source
of
agricultural
labor
.

Serfdom
,
indeed
,
was
an
institution
that
reflected
a
fairly
common
practice
whereby
great
landlords
were
assured
that
others
worked
to
feed
them
and
were
held
down
,
legally
and
economically
,
while
doing
so
.

This
arrangement
provided
most
of
the
agricultural
labour
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
.

Slavery
persisted
right
through
the
Middle
Ages
,
but
it
was
rare
.

In
the
later
Middle
Ages
serfdom
began
to
disappear
west
of
the
Rhine
even
as
it
spread
through
eastern
Europe
.

Serfdom
reached
Eastern
Europe
centuries
later
than
Western
Europe
—
it
became
dominant
around
the
00th
century
.

In
many
of
these
countries
serfdom
was
abolished
during
the
Napoleonic
invasions
of
the
early
00th
century
,
through
in
some
it
persisted
till
mid
-
or
late
-
00th
century
.

Newberry
Township
is
a
township
in
York
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Geography
According

the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
township
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
is
land
and
,
or
0.00
%
,
is

.

The
township
is
located
in
northern
York
County
in
south-central
Pennsylvania
.

The
Susquehanna
River
forms
the
eastern
border
of
the
township
,
and
the
western
part
of
the
township
entirely
surrounds
the
borough
of
Lewisberry
.

History
Prior
to
the
coming
of
the
first
settlers
in
0000
,
Newberry
Township
was
inhabited
by
the
Susquehannock
Indians
.

Before
0000
,
all
settlement
in
Pennsylvania
was
kept
east
of
the
Susquehanna
River
,
but
the
Indian
Treaty
of
0000
extended
Lancaster
County
's
boundary
westward
indefinitely
.

Quaker
families
from
Lancaster
and
Chester
counties
immediately
set
out
across
the
Susquehanna
to
find
new
land
.

These
settlers
utilized
the
Middletown
Ferry
to
access
the
west
bank
of
the
river
,
and
once
they
reached
what
is
now
Newberry
Township
,
settled
throughout
the
Fishing
Creek
and
Bennetts
Run
valleys
.

Newberry
Township
was
organized
in
0000
and
included
what
is
now
Fairview
Township
.

Prior
to
the
start
of
the
Revolutionary
War
,
the
early
Quaker
settlers
became
dissatisfied
with
the
quality
of
the
farmland
within
Newberry
Township
and
began
moving
out
of
it
.

German
families
from
central
York
County
,
and
Berks
and
Lancaster
counties
,
soon
arrived
to
take
over
the
vacant
farmland
.

By
the
late
00th
century
,
several
towns
had
sprung
up
throughout
the
township
.

Lewisberry
and
Newberrytown
were
early
Quaker
settlements
.

Newberrytown
began
as
a
tract
of
Quaker
meeting
land
,
with
a
log
meetinghouse
built
in
0000
.

Later
,
a
new
meetinghouse
was
built
halfway
between
Lewisberry
and
the
Newberrytown
meeting
land
,
and
the
tract
was
developed
as
a
town
in
0000
.

Newberrytown
was
situated
on
the
road
from
Lancaster
to
Carlisle
(
which
crossed
the
Susquehanna
River
at
the
York
Haven
Ferry
)
and
became
an
important
stopping
place
along
the
way
.

Lewisberry
was
also
surveyed
and
platted
in
the
0000s
.

Its
stores
became
busy
and
prosperous
.

Schools
were
operated
in
both
communities
.

Early
settlers
were
also
attracted
to
the
vicinity
of
Yocumtown
because
of
the
water
power
of
Fishing
Creek
.

Along
its
banks
they
built
fulling
mills
that
carded
wool
for
area
farmers
,
woolen
cloth
mills
,
and
grist
mills
.

By
the
mid-0000s
,
the
village
of
Yocumtown
had
established
itself
with
a
log
schoolhouse
,
a
blacksmith
shop
,
and
a
tannery
.

Goldsboro
and
York
Haven
prospered
due
to
their
location
on
the
Susquehanna
River
and
adjoining
canal
route
.

A
ferry
was
also
established
at
the
site
of
Goldsboro
in
0000
.

Both
Goldsboro
and
the
village
of
Cly
were
located
along
the
important
stagecoach
route
between
York
and
Harrisburg
,
where
a
turnpike
was
completed
between
the
two
towns
in
0000
.

The
railroad
,
built
in
the
late
0000s
,
also
ran
through
Goldsboro
.

However
,
the
village
remained
small
through
the
first
half
of
the
00th
century
.

York
Haven
,
also
a
ferry
point
,
began
as
a
flour
milling
town
.

In
0000
,
the
York
Haven
Company
,
which
built
four
large
mills
,
prepared
the
town
plan
.

Large
hotels
,
dry
goods
and
hardware
stores
,
copper
shops
that
manufactured
flour
barrels
,
and
a
sawmill
all
became
part
of
the
town
’s
healthy
economy
.

Large
keelboat
s
of
wheat
were
brought
down
the
river
to
the
mills
in
York
Haven
,
then
the
flour
was
sent
by
wagon
or
canal
to
Baltimore
.

The
town
became
a
popular
resort
,
with
city
boarders
in
the
summer
and
gambling
at
the
hotel
.

Early
prosperity
began
to
decline
during
the
0000s
,
when
the
Codorus
Canal
was
completed
into
the
town
of
York
,
luring
business
away
from
York
Haven
.

The
flour
mills
closed
down
but
were
later
replaced
with
a
paper
mill
.

In
0000
,
Fairview
Township
was
formed
from
the
northern
half
of
the
original
Newberry
Township
.

Lewisberry
incorporated
as
a
separate
borough
in
0000
,
as
did
Goldsboro
in
0000
and
York
Haven
in
0000
.

With
these
losses
of
population
and
area
,
Newberry
Township
reached
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
with
a
population
of
just
over
0,000
(
only
000
more
people
than
in

)
.

During
the
first
two
decades
of
the
00th
century
,
the
population
of
the
township
actually
declined
.

The
following
three
decades
showed
a
slow
,
but
steady
,
increase
in
population
.

Development
to
this
point
(
0000
)
was
mainly
concentrated
along
the
major
roads
and
villages
in
the
township
.

Newberrytown
,
Cly

Conewago

,
Yocumtown

were
the
centers
of

Spring
Grove
is
a
borough
in
York
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
site
of
Spring
Grove
was
laid
out
in
0000
on
the
banks
of
Codorus
Creek
,
midway
between
York
and
Hanover
,
by
a
surveyor
for
the
Penns
.

Its
growth
since
that
time
falls
into
two
periods
,
each
lasting
approximately
000
years
.

The
first
witnessed
development
of
the
borough
as
an
iron-making
center
.

The
second
,
which
extends
to
the
present
day
,
is
as
a
papermaking
center
.

The
businesses
of
both
periods
have
relied
on
certain
natural
resource
s
of
the
area
.

Originally
,
Spring
Grove
was
a
part
of
Paradise
Township
and
was
contained
within
the
boundaries
of
Lancaster
County
.

York
County
was
formed
in
0000
and
Jackson
Township
,
including
Spring
Grove
,
in
0000
.

The
residents
of
the
community
petitioned
the
County
Court
in
0000
for
incorporation
as
a
borough
,
and
in
August
of
that
year
their
petition
was
granted
.

Since
that
time
,
the
borough
has
grown
in
area
as
a
result
of
annexation
of
the
surrounding
land
,
the
largest
annexation
having
taken
place
in
0000
.

In
the
0000s
,
attracted
by
the
presence
of
water
,
iron
ore
and
wood
for
charcoal
in
the
Pigeon
Hills
,
an
iron
manufacturer
established
a
forge
at
"
Spring
Forge
"
.

It
is
known
as
Spring
Grove
.

The
early
German
and
English
woodchoppers
who
flocked
to
this
first
Pennsylvania
iron
industry
west
of
the
Susquehanna
River
were
the
forbears
of
today
's
community
.

By
the
mid-00th
century
,
the
manufacturing
of
iron
had
grown
to
a
point
where
almost
of
iron
bar
were
produced
locally
each
year
.

By
0000
,
however
,
the
iron
business
had
been
suspended
,
and
its
buildings
were
converted
to
the
manufacturing
of
paper
.

Once
again
local
resources
,
wood
and
water
,
were
largely
responsible
for
the
location
of
this
industry
in
the
Spring
Grove
area
.

Thirteen
years
later
,
the
plant
was
purchased
by
P.
H.
Glatfelter
for
$
00,000
.

Other
basic
industries
,
such
as
brick-making
and
the
manufacture
of
explosives
,
have
from
time
to
time
established
themselves
in
the
borough
.

None
,
however
,
have
remained
as
long
nor
have
been
as
successful
as
the
paper
mill
.

Since
0000
,
the
growth
of
the
borough
has
reflected
growth
of
the
Glatfelter
Paper
Mill
.

Stewartstown
is
a
borough
in
York
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was

at
the
0000
census
.

History
There
were
settlers
in
the
Stewartstown
area
as
early
as
0000
.

This
part
of
southern
York
County
was
claimed
by
both
Maryland
and
Pennsylvania
,
and
the
boundary
dispute
was
settled
by
the
surveying
of
the
Mason
–
Dixon
Line
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
a
road
had
been
well
established
between
York
and
Baltimore
,
and
Stewartstown
's
main
street
of
today
lies
along
a
portion
of
the
road
.

Around
0000
,
a
group
of
farmers
set
out
to
establish
a
town
in
south
central
Hopewell
Township
.

The
earliest
buildings
were
several
houses
,
a
workshop
for
making
furniture
and
wheels
,
a
store
,
and
a
tavern
.

Anthony
Stewart
,
owner
of
the
workshop
,
served
as
the
village
clerk
,
and
his
shop
became
the
main
meeting
place
.

The
village
was
first
known
as
Meadstown
,
after
Benedict
Meads
,
owner
of
the
tavern
and
the
store
.

Later
it
became
known
as
Mechanicsburg
because
of
a
large
amount
of
tradesmen
who
lived
in
the
community
.

By
0000
,
the
town
had
its
own
post
office
,
and
Stewart
was
appointed
the
first
postmaster
.

There
was
already
another
Pennsylvania
town
named
Mechanicsburg
,
so
postal
officials
assigned
the
name
"
Guilford
"
to
the
community
.

Through
the
efforts
of
Anthony
Stewart
,
with
the
help
of
Judge
Adam
Ebaugh
,
the
Post
Office
Department
changed
the
town
's
postmark
to
"
Stewartstown
"
on
March
00
,
0000
.

seat
of

County
,

York
is
currently
the
00th
largest
city
in
Pennsylvania
.

00th
century
York
,
also
known
as
Yorktown
in
the
mid
00th
to
early
00th
century
,
was
founded
in
0000
by
settlers
from
the
Philadelphia
region
,
and
named
for
the
English
city
of
the
same
name
.

By
0000
,
most
of
the
area
residents
were
of
either
German
or
Scots-Irish
descent
.

York
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
September
00
,
0000
,
and
as
a
city
on
January
00
,
0000
.

During
the
American
Revolutionary
War
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
York
served
as
the
temporary
capital
of
the
Continental
Congress
.

The
Articles
of
Confederation
were
drafted
and
adopted
in
York
,
though
they
would
not
be
ratified
until
March
0000
.

York
styles
itself
the
first
Capital
of
the
United
States
,
although
historians
generally
consider
it
to
be
the
fourth
capital
,
after
Philadelphia
,
Baltimore
and
Lancaster
.

The
claim
arises
from
the
assertion
that
the
Articles
of
Confederation
was
the
first
legal
document
to
refer
to
the
colonies
as
"
the
United
States
of
America
"
.

The
argument
depends
on
whether
the
Declaration
of
Independence
,
which
also
uses
the
term
,
would
be
considered
a
true
legal
document
of
the
United
States
,
being
drafted
under
and
in
opposition
to
British
rule
.

This
does
not
,
however
,
prevent
modern
businesses
and
organizations
in
the
York
area
,
such
as
the
First
Capital
Dispensing
Co.
,
First
Capital
Engineering
and
First
Capital
Federal
Credit
Union
from
using
the
name
.

The
Conway
Cabal
,
a
political
intrigue
against
General
George
Washington
,
had
its
origins
in
the
Golden
Plough
Tavern
in
York
.

00th
century
According
to
U.S.
census
reports
from
0000
through
0000
,
York
ranked
within
the
nation
's
top
000
most
populous
urban
areas
.

During
the
American
Civil
War
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
York
became
the
largest
Northern
town
to
be
occupied
by
the
Confederate
army
when
the
division
of
Major
General
Jubal
Anderson
Early
spent
June
00
–
00
,
0000
,
in
and
around
the
town
while
the
brigade
of
John
B.
Gordon
marched
to
the
Susquehanna
River
at
Wrightsville
and
back
.

Early
laid
York
under
tribute
and
collected
food
,
supplies
,
clothing
,
shoes
,
and
$
00,000
in
cash
from
citizens
and
merchants
before
departing
westward
obeying
the
revised
orders
of
Robert
E.
Lee
.

The
sprawling
York
U.S.
Army
Hospital
on
Penn
Commons
served
thousands
of
Union
soldiers
wounded
at
the
battles
of
Antietam
and
Gettysburg
.

In
the
Postbellum
era
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
York
remained
a
regional
center
for
local
agriculture
,
but
increasingly
became
an
important
industrial
center
,
with
such
industries
as
steam
engine
s
,
railroad
manufacturing
,
and
papermaking
coming
to
the
forefront
.

York
also
features
some
unique
architecture
ranging
from
colonial
era
buildings
to
large
gothic
churches
.

00th
century
The
York
Motor
Car
Co.
built
Pullman
automobile
s
on
North
George
St.
from
0000
thorough
0000
.

An
early
and
unique
six-wheeled
prototype
was
involved
in
one
of
the
city
's
first
known
automobile
accidents
.

Another
model
was
driven
to
San
Francisco
and
back
over
about
one
month
to
prove
its
reliability
several
years
before
the
creation
of
the
Lincoln
Highway
which
ran
through
town
,
connecting
New
York
and
San
Francisco
.

The
York
area
had
also
been
home
for
more
than
000
years
to
the
Pfaltzgraff
company
,
which
built
its
first
pottery
factory
in
the
area
in
0000
and
continued
manufacturing
in
York
until
0000
.

Though
now
produced
by
The
Hershey
Company
,
the
York
Peppermint
Pattie
was
created
in
York
in
0000
.

00st
century
The
city
of
York
experienced
many
noteworthy
achievements
and
embarrassments
to
start
the
00st
century
.

In
0000
,
the
city
faced
a
budget
shortfall
of
$
0,000,000
.

Mayor
John
S.
Brenner
's
plan
to
raise
the
money
by
asking
York
County
's
000,000
adult
residents
to
donate
$
0.00
to
the
city
received
national
attention
.

The
plan
,
referred
to
by
some
as
the
"
Big
Mac
"
Plan
,
did
not
raise
all
the
moneys
sought
.

After
many
years
of
attempting
to
secure
funding
for
a
stadium
and
a
baseball
team
to
play
in
it
,
the
first
decade
of
the
century
saw
York
realize
both
goals
.

In
0000
,
Sovereign
Bank
Stadium
,
home
of
the
York
Revolution
,
opened
in
the
Arch
Street
neighborhood
.

The
stadium
,
along
with
other
large
projects
such
as
the
York
County
Judicial
Center
and
the
Codo
000
luxury
apartment
lofts
,
symbolizes
York
's
extensive
redevelopment
efforts
.

York
was
featured
during
the
0000
U.S.
Presidential
Election
,
when
National
Public
Radio
's
Michele
Norris
and
Steve
Inskeep
chose
to
showcase
the
city
in
"
The
York
Project
:
Race
&
the
'00
Vote
.
"

The
program
was
aired
as
a
0-part
series
and
featured
different
York
citizens
discussing
race
relations
,
racial
perceptions
,
and
the
emotions
inspired
by
the
0000
election
.

Norris
stated
that
York

settlement
east
of
the
Indian
village
began
.

In
0000
,
Massasoit
and
his
oldest
son
sold
to
certain
Plymouth
Colony
settlers
what
is
now
Warren
and
parts
of
Barrington
,
Rhode
Island
;
Swansea
,
Massachusetts
;
and
Rehoboth
,
Massachusetts
.

After
the
death
of
Massasoit
,
relations
between
the
Indians
and
the
settlers
became
strained
,
leading
to
King
Philip
's
War
in
0000
.

The
English
settlement
at
Sowams
was
destroyed
during
the
war
,
but
rebuilt
.

In
0000
,
the
township
was
officially
incorporated
with
the
name
Sowams
;
in
0000
,
the
Plymouth
Colony
merged
with
the
Massachusetts
Bay
Colony
.

Warren
was
ceded
to
Rhode
Island
from
Massachusetts
in
0000
.

The
town
was
named
"
Warren
"
after
a
British
naval
hero
,
Admiral
Sir
Peter
Warren
,
after
a
victory
at
Louisburg
in
0000
.

At
the
time
of
cession
in
0000
,
Barrington
,
Rhode
Island
was
unified
with
Warren
,
until
it
was
separated
again
in
0000
.

In
the
mid-00th
century
the
town
was
well
known
as
a
whaling
port
,
and
shipbuilding
became
an
important
industry
.

The
Revolutionary
War
seriously
affected
Warren
's
commercial
prosperity
,
and
the
town
suffered
British
raids
in
0000
along
with
the
rest
of
the
region
.

Warren
was
the
original
home
of
Brown
University
,
founded
in
0000
as
the
College
in
the
English
Colony
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
.

The
school
registered
its
first
students
in
0000
.

Brown
was
the
Baptist
answer
to
Congregationalist
Yale
and
Harvard
,
Presbyterian
Princeton
,
and
Episcopalian
Penn
and
Columbia
.

At
the
time
,
it
was
the
only
one
of
these
schools
that
welcomed
students
of
all
religious
persuasions
(
following
the
example
of
Roger
Williams
,
who
founded
Rhode
Island
in
0000
on
the
same
principle
)
.

Within
the
decade
after
the
Revolution
commerce
revived
,
and
until
the
middle
of
the
00th
century
,
Warren
was
famous
for
the
fine
vessels
launched
from
its
yards
.

These
vessels
,
largely
commanded
by
Warren
men
and
operated
by
Warren
crews
,
engaged
in
whaling
,
merchant
service
,
and
the
West
India
trade
.

Three
notable
ships
were
built
in
Warren
by
Chase
&
Davis
:
the
0000
clipper
Lookout
,
the
0000
clipper
bark
Gem
of
the
Sea
,
and
the
0000
clipper
bark
Mary
Ogden
.

With
the
decline
of
the
whaling
industry
and
related
seafaring
commerce
toward
the
middle
of
the
00th
century
,
business
attention
turned
to
textile
manufacturing
.

Warren
's
first
cotton
mill
was
erected
by
the
Warren
Manufacturing
Company
in
0000
.

Further
mills
and
factories
developed
during
and
after
the
Civil
War
,
attracting
an
immigrant
work
force
.

Presently
Warren
is
home
to
several
waterfront
businesses
such
as
Blount
Marine
,
Blount
Seafood
,
and
Anchorage
Inc.
(
Dyer
Boats
)
.

History
Coventry
was
first
settled
in
the
early
00th
century
,
when
the
town
was
part
of
Warwick
.

Since
the
area
was
so
far
away
from
the
center
of
Warwick
,
the
area
that
became
Coventry
grew
very
slowly
.

However
,
by
0000
,
enough
farmers
(
about
000
families
)
had
settled
in
the
area
that
they
petitioned
the
General
Assembly
of
Rhode
Island
to
create
their
own
town
.

The
petition
was
granted
,
and
the
new
town
was
named
Coventry
,
Coventry
was
named
after
the
English
city
of
Coventry
.

For
the
rest
of
the
00th
century
,
Coventry
remained
a
rural
town
populated
by
farmers
.

Among
the
buildings
that
survive
are
the
Waterman
Tavern
(
0000s
)
,
the
Nathanael
Greene
Homestead
(
0000
)
,
and
the
Paine
Homestead
(
late
00th
century/early
00th
century
)
.

The
oldest
church
in
Coventry
,
Maple
Root
Baptist
Church
,
dates
from
the
end
of
the
00th
century
.

The
congregation
was
organized
in
0000
and
was
affiliated
with
the
General
Six-Principle
Baptists
.

During
the
War
of
Independence
,
the
people
of
Coventry
were
supporters
of
the
patriot
cause
.

Nathanael
Greene
,
a
resident
of
Coventry
,
rose
through
the
ranks
to
become
a
leading
general
of
the
American
army
.

By
the
end
of
the
war
,
Greene
was
second
in
command
in
the
US
army
after
George
Washington
.

In
the
00th
century
,
the
Industrial
Revolution
came
to
Coventry
with
the
building
of
the
first
mill
in
Anthony
.

Over
the
next
century
,
the
eastern
end
of
town
became
very
industrialized
,
with
manufacturing
centers
being
located
in
Anthony
,
Washington
,
Quidnick
,
and
Harris
villages
.

Many
of
the
old
factories
still
stand
in
the
town
,
and
the
village
centers
(
in
particular
Anthony
and
Quidnick
)
remain
mostly
intact
.

The
demographics
of
the
town
also
changed
as
these
new
mill
villages
were
populated
by
French
Canadian
and
Irish
immigrants
.

By
the
end
of
the
00th
century
,
almost
one
fourth
of
the
population
was
born
outside
the
US
,
and
French
was
the
primary
language
for
many
of
the
people
in
the
eastern
part
of
Coventry
.

Not
all
immigrants
,
however
,
worked
in
the
factories
.

Census
records
from
the
late
00th
century
show
that
some
of
them
owned
farms
.

By
comparison
,
the
western
end
of
the
town
remained
very
rural
,
with
the
only
centers
of
population
being
located
at
Greene
and
Summit
,
both
being
established
as
railroad
stations
on
the
New
York
,
New
Haven
and
Hartford
Railroad
.

In
the
00th
century
,
the
town
went
through
much
change
.

The
advent
of
the
automobile
brought
an
end
of
the
railroad
(
which
was
dismantled
in
the
0000s
,
and
only
within
the
past
00
years
,
revitalized
as
the
Washington
Secondary
Rail
Trail
|
Greenway
)
.

Most
of
the
old
factories
closed
during
this
time
.

In
the
late
00th
century
,
many
new
people
moved
to
Coventry
,
most
of
them
being
from
the
Providence
area
.

These
newcomers
moved
because
of
the
large
amount
of
land
available
to
build
on
.

The
eastern
part
of
the
town
became
suburbanized
.

Currently
,
there
is
a
movement
in
the
town
to
limit
new
homes
in
order
to
keep
the
rural
flavor
of
the
western
part
of
the
town
.

Recreation
Coventry
offers
a
few
recreation
facilities
.

The
town
has
youth
sport
leagues
for
football
(
boasting
the
0000

Youth
Football
National

)
,
basketball
,
baseball
,
and

The
town
had
been
investing
in
the
Coventry
Greenway
.

The
Coventry

is
a
pedestrian

bicycle
path
built
on

right-of-way

since
0000
.

Founded
by
Samuel
Gorton
in
0000
,
Warwick
has
witnessed
major
events
in
American
history
.

The
City
of
Warwick
(
and
T.F.
Green
Airport
)
is
located
approximately
south
of
downtown
Providence
,
and
southwest
of
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
and
northeast
of
New
York
City
.

Warwick
was
decimated
during
King
Philip
's
War
(
0000
–
00
)
and
was
the
site
of
the
Gaspée
Affair
,
a
significant
prelude
to
the
American
Revolution
.

Warwick
is
also
the
home
of
revolutionary
war
general
Nathanael
Greene
,
George
Washington
's
second-in-command
,
and
the
Civil
War
hero
of
the
battle
of
Gettysburg
,
General
George
S.
Greene
.

Warwick
is
home
to
Rhode
Island
's
main
airport
,
T.
F.
Green
Airport
,
which
serves
the
greater
Providence
area
and
also
functions
as
a
reliever
for
Logan
International
Airport
in
Boston
,
Massachusetts
.

It
is
also
the
home
of
the
00rd
Military
Police
Brigade
of
the
Rhode
Island
Army
National
Guard
.

Early
history
Warwick
was
founded
in
0000
by
Samuel
Gorton
when
Narragansett
Indian
Chief
Sachem
Miantonomi
agreed
to
accept
000
fathoms
of
Wampum
peague
for
what
was
known
as
"
The
Shawhomett
Purchase
"
.

This
included
the
present
day
towns
of
Coventry
and
West
Warwick
.

However
,
the
purchase
was
not
without
dispute
.

The
two
sachems
of
the
area
,
Sacononoco
and
Pumham
,
stated
that
Miantonomi
had
sold
the
land
without
asking
for
their
approval
.

The
two
sachems
took
their
case
to
Boston
,
Massachusetts
where
they
placed
their
lands
under
Massachusetts
rule
.

In
0000
Massachusetts
sent
a
militia
force
to
Shawomett
to
arrest
Gorton
and
his
followers
.

After
a
tense
standoff
,
all
but
three
of
the
Gortonists
surrendered
to
the
Massachusetts
force
.

This
event
caused
the
other
three
towns
on
Narragansett
Bay
(
Providence
,
Portsmouth
,
and
Newport
)
to
unite
and
get
a
royal
charter
allowing
the
towns
on
Narragansett
Bay
to
form
the
Colony
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
.

In
0000
,
Gorton
was
granted
a
Charter
by
Robert
Rich
,
0nd
Earl
of
Warwick
,
Lord
Admiral
and
head
of
the
Parliamentary
Commission
on
Plantation
Affairs
.

Because
of
this
,
the
name
of
the
settlement
was
changed
from
Shawhomett
to
Warwick
.

While
Massachusetts
continued
to
lay
claim
to
the
area
,
it
made
no
further
effort
to
enforce
it
.

In
0000
,
Warwick
was
the
scene
for
the
first
violent
act
against
the
Crown
.

In
what
was
to
be
called
the
Gaspée
Affair
,
local
patriots
boarded
HMS
Gaspée
,
a
revenue
cutter
charged
with
enforcing
the
Stamp
Act
0000
and
Townshend
Acts
in
Narragansett
Bay
,
where
smuggling
was
common
.

It
was
here
that
the
first
blood
of
the
American
Revolution
was
spilled
when
the
commanding
officer
of
the
Gaspée
,
Lt.
Dudingston
,
was
shot
in
his
crotch
while
resisting
the
taking
of
his
ship
.

The
Gaspée
was
stripped
of
all
cannon
and
arms
before
being
torched
.

During
the
Revolution
,
Warwick
militiamen
participated
in
the
battles
of
Montreal
,
Quebec
,
Saratoga
,
Monmouth
,
and
Trenton
,
and
were
present
for
the
surrender
at
Yorktown
.

Jamestown
is
a
town
located
in
Newport
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Jamestown
is
situated
almost
entirely
on
Conanicut
Island
,
the
second
largest
island
in
Narragansett
Bay
.

History
Humans
arrived
in
the
area
about
00,000
to
00,000
years
ago
,
at
the
end
of
the
last
ice
age
,
when
they
settled
near
streams
and
rivers
.

Ongoing
melting
of
glaciers
caused
the
sea
level
to
rise
,
covering
low-lying
areas
and
eventually
filling
Narragansett
Bay
.

The
rising
sea
forced
humans
to
higher
elevations
,
and
submerged
most
traces
of
the
earliest
inhabitants
.

The
oldest
human
artifacts
found
on
Conanicut
Island
date
from
around
0000
BC
.

In
0000
,
the
Italian
navigator
Giovanni
da
Verrazzano
and
his
crew
visited
Narragansett
Bay
.

In
0000
or
0000
,
"
Dutch
Island
"
was
used
by
fur
traders
.

In
0000
the
English
made
arrangements
to
use
Conanicut
Island
for
grazing
sheep
.

Ferries
were
in
operation
between
Conanicut
Island
and
Newport
by
0000
.

In
0000
,
Conanicut
Island
was
incorporated
as
the
town
of
Jamestown
.

There
were
about
000
residents
.

The
town
was
named
for
James
,
Duke
of
York
,
who
would
become
King
James
II
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
many
of
Conanicut
Island
's
current
roads
were
in
place
.

In
0000
,
the
town
of
Jamestown
built
a
windmill
for
grinding
corn
,
which
used
the
sea
breeze
for
power
since
there
was
no
source
of
running
water
to
turn
a
waterwheel
.

On
December
00
,
0000
,
000
British
and
Hessian
troops
landed
at
East
Ferry
on
Conanicut
Island
and
marched
to
West
Ferry
,
where
they
burned
the
ferry
house
.

As
they
returned
to
East
Ferry
,
they
destroyed
many
buildings
,
including
fourteen
homes
;
which
caused
more
than
000
of
Conanicut
Island
's
000
residents
to
flee
to
the
mainland
.

In
December
,
0000
,
a
British
fleet
arrived
in
Narragansett
Bay
and
occupied
Newport
.

The
British
took
over
the
colonial
militia
batteries
at
Fort
Dumpling
(
now
part
of
Fort
Wetherill
)
and
the
Conanicut
Battery
at
Beavertail
(
just
south
of
Fort
Getty
,
at
the
end
of
Battery
Lane
)
.

The
British
left
Narragansett
Bay
in
October
0000
.

As
they
departed
,
they
destroyed
the
fortifications
they
had
occupied
,
and
burned
down
the
Beavertail
Lighthouse
.

By
0000
,
Beavertail
Light
was
back
in
operation
.

In
0000
,
Jamestown
rebuilt
the
Jamestown
Windmill
and
Quaker
Meetinghouse
that
had
been
destroyed
during
the
occupation
.

In
0000
Fort
Dumpling
was
established
on
the
site
of
previous
fortifications
overlooking
East
Passage
.

A
tall
stone
tower
atop
the
highest
cliff
could
hold
eight
guns
.

In
0000
,
the
town
of
Jamestown
commissioned
a
steam
powered
ferryboat
.

In
May
0000
,
service
was
initiated
between
Jamestown
and
Newport
.

The
availability
of
reliable
and
comfortable
ferry
service
to
and
from
Newport
had
a
significant
impact
on
agricultural
Conanicut
Island
.

Jamestown
became
a
destination
for
both
day
trips
and
summer
vacations
.

The
0000s
and
0000s
saw
a
construction
boom
,
with
hotels
,
private
summer
homes
and
municipal
buildings
going
up
.

The
island
's
population
tripled
between
0000
and
0000
.

There
was
a
burst
of
military
fortification
activity
from
0000
to
the
end
of
World
War
I
.

The
Spanish-American
War
,
which
began
in
0000
,
was
a
catalyst
.

Work
on
Dutch
Island
's
Fort
Grebel
began
.

The
War
Department
bought
for
Fort
Getty
and
fortifications
were
quickly
erected
.

Summer
homes
were
condemned
near
Fort
Dumpling
to
establish
Fort
Wetherill
.

More
land
was
acquired
at
Prospect
Hill
,
near
the
Conanicut
Battery
site
,
for
an
observation
and
fire
control
station
.

The
Government
established
a
torpedo
station
and
test
facility
on
Gould
Island
.

Then
,
at
the
end
of
the
First
World
War
,
the
Conanicut
Island
fortifications
fell
into
disuse
.

Meanwhile
,
Jamestown
was
a
bustling
summer
destination
.

In
0000
,
it
had
nine
hotels
.

But
the
golden
age
of
large
resort
hotels
was
brief
in
Jamestown
and
elsewhere
.

Patronage
rapidly
declined
in
the
nineteen-twenties
.

The
Thorndike
Hotel
was
demolished
in
0000
.

In
0000
a
major
hurricane
caused
much
property
damage
and
the
loss
of
more
than
000
lives
in
the
Narragansett
Bay
region
.

It
swept
much
of
the
sand
from
the
Mackerel
Cove
beach
,
destroyed
its
popular
Beach
Pavilion
and
speeded
approvals
for
a
bridge
to
Saunderstown
by
destroying
the
West
Ferry
docks
.

The
first
Jamestown
Bridge
opened
in
the
summer
of
0000
,
replacing
West
Ferry
service
with
a
continuously
available
link
to
the
west
.

In
0000
the
Gardner
House
,
one
of
the
larger
hotels
,
was
taken
down
after
being
idle
for
several
years
.

A
USO
building
was
constructed
on
its
site
.

(
After
the
war
,
the
building
was
purchased
by
the
town
and
is
now
known
as
the
Community
Center
.

It
was
extensively
landscaped
and
remodeled
in
0000
.
)

World
War
II
brought
establishment
or
reactivatation
of
military
bases
around
Narragansett
Bay
,
including
Forts
Getty
and
Wetherill
on
Conanicut
Island
,
Fort
Greble
on
Dutch
Island
,
a
torpedo
factory
on
Goat
Island
and
a
torpedo
station
on
Gould
Island
.

In
0000
,
the
Newport
(
Pell
)
Bridge
was
completed
,
establishing
Route
000
as
a
continuous
highway
from
South
County
to
Newport
.

With
its
completion
,
traditional
ferry
service
was
eliminated
.

(
The
bridge
is
celebrated
on
the
Rhode
Island
commemorative
quarters
.
)

The
Bay
View
Hotel
,
the
last
of
the
very
large
hotels
,
ceased
operation
in
the
0000s
.

The
building
was
demolished
in
0000
.

Four
years
later
,
the
Bay
View
Condominiums
opened
for
occupancy
.

The
building
exterior
was
carefully
designed
to
closely
resemble
the
hotel
.

The
Bay
Voyage
Hotel
,
operating
as
a
time
share
resort
,
is
the
only
survivor
of
the
many
hotels
that
once
lined
Jamestown
's
eastern
harbor
area
.

In
0000
,
the
Jamestown-Verrazano
Bridge
replaced
the
narrow
steel
bridge
erected
in
0000
.

It
was
accompanied
by
construction
of
a
new
western-end
access
road
and
a
cross-Conanicut
Island
highway
.

Geological
History
All
of
Rhode
Island
was
part
of
a
volcanic
arc
or
micro-continent
called
Avalonia
,
which
formed
south
of
the
equator
more
than
000
million
years
ago
.

Avalonia
drifted
northward
;
eventually
colliding
with
Proto
North
America
about
000
million
years
ago
.

The
impact
contributed
most
of
the
land
that
has
become
the
New
England
states
and
created
most
of
the
northern
Appalachians
.

About
000
million
years
ago
,
North
America
and
North
Africa
collided
as
part
of
the
formation
of
a
supercontinent
,
Pangaea
.

For
more
than
000
million
years
,
Jamestown
was
located
deep
within
the
supercontinent
.

The
layers
of
shale
and
coal
that
are
common
in
the
Narraganset
Bay
area
were
formed
during
this
period
.

About
000
million
years
ago
,
Pangaea
broke
up
,
the
Atlantic
Ocean
formed
and
slowly
widened
.

During
the
past
00,000
years
,
Jamestown
was
visited
by
glaciers
at
least
twice
.

They
gouged
out
channels
in
the
Narragansett
Basin
and
left
deposits
of
rocks
and
soil
throughout
the
area
.

The
last
glaciers
left
the
area
about
00,000
years
ago
.

Sea
level
was
hundreds
of
feet
lower
than
today
;
but
as
additional
glaciers
melted
around
the
world
,
the
sea
rose
,
covering
the
continental
shelf
and
eventually
filling
Narragansett
Bay
.

Little
Compton
is
a
town
in
Newport
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
United
States
.

Its
population
was
0,000
at
the
time
of
the
0000
census
.

Little
Compton
is
located
in
southeastern
Rhode
Island
,
between
the
Sakonnet
River
and
the
Massachusetts
state
border
.

It
is
the
birthplace
of
the
Rhode
Island
Red
hen
.

History
According
to
00th
century
land
evidence
,
the
area
now
known
as
Little
Compton
was
originally
inhabited
by
the
Sakonnet
(
variations
include
Sogkonate
,
Seconit
,
Seaconnet
,
etc.
)
tribe
,
who
were
led
by
Awashonks
.

Awashonks
'
people
lived
in
Wilbour
Woods
in
the
winter
time
and
at
Sakonnet
Point
in
the
summer
time
.

Her
step-son
Mamannuah
lead
a
separate
Sakonnet
tribe
in
the
Adamsville
area
.

The
two
leaders
had
frequent
disputes
over
land
and
vied
with
each
other
to
be
recognized
by
the
English
as
the
sole
Sakonnet
leader
.

Sakonnet
has
been
interpreted
in
a
variety
of
ways
:
"
the
black
goose
comes
"
or
"
where
the
water
pours
fourth
.
"

The
first
European
settlers
in
Little
Compton
were
Englishmen
from
Duxbury
,
Massachusetts
in
the
Plymouth
Colony
who
sought
to
expand
their
land
holdings
.

After
first
attempting
negotiations
with
Awashonks
,
they
petitioned
the
Plymouth
Colony
,
which
granted
them
their
charter
.

In
a
series
of
lotteries
beginning
in
0000
and
ending
in
the
early
0000s
,
they
divided
the
land
in
Little
Compton
into
lots
of
standard
sizes
and
began
settling
there
.

Among
these
00
original
proprietors
was
Colonel
Benjamin
Church
.

Church
was
well
known
for
his
role
in
the
late
00th-century
conflicts
with
surrounding
Native
American
tribes
,
notably
the
Narragansetts
and
Wampanoags
.

In
0000
,
Church
built
his
homestead
in
Little
Compton
,
just
prior
to
King
Philip
's
War
.

Today
,
a
plaque
on
the
side
of
West
Main
Road
gives
the
location
of
his
original
homestead
.

The
plaque
is
located
near
house
number
000
on
the
eastern
side
of
West
Main
Road
.

In
0000
,
Sakonnet
was
incorporated
by
the
Plymouth
Colony
and
renamed
Little
Compton
.

This
is
possibly
a
reference
to
Little
Compton
in
Warwickshire
,
England
.

However
,
there
is
no
direct
evidence
to
substantiate
this
relationship
.

By
0000
,
Little
Compton
secured
its
own
royal
decree
and
was
annexed
to
Newport
County
as
a
part
of
Rhode
Island
along
with
Tiverton
and
Bristol
.

Because
Little
Compton
was
once
part
of
the
Plymouth
colony
,
all
probate
and
land
records
prior
to
0000
can
be
found
in
Taunton
and
New
Bedford
.

Sites
of
historic
interest
in
Little
Compton
include
the
Wilbor
House
,
built
in
0000
by
Samuel
Wilbor
,
now
the
home
of
the
Little
Compton
Historical
Society

.

The
entire
town
commons
is
also
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

There
are
about
00
historic
cemeteries
in
the
town
.

Colonel
Benjamin
Church
and
his
family
are
buried
in
the
Little
Compton
Commons
cemetery
,
as
is
Elizabeth
Pabodie
,
the
eldest
daughter
of
John
Alden
and
Priscilla
Mullins
of
Mayflower
fame
.

The
stones
in
the
cemetery
reflect
a
style
of
carving
similar
to
that
found
both
in
Newport
and
in
Boston
during
the
same
time
period
.

Little
Compton
is
the
location
for
one
of
three
town
commons
in
Rhode
Island
.

The
others
are
in
Warren
and
Bristol
.

This
is
most
likely
a
result
of
the
town
having
been
originally
laid
out
by
settlers
from
the
Plymouth
and
Massachusetts
Colonies
.

Land
for
the
common
was
designated
in
August
0000
and
has
been
used
ever
since
as
both
a
religious
and
civic
center
for
social
activities
in
the
town
.

While
there
are
only
a
few
00th-century
structures
still
standing
(
these
include
the
Wilbor
house
and
Peabody
house
)
,
there
are
many
which

Burrillville
is
a
town
in
Providence
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
United
States
.

It
was
incorporated
as
an
independent
municipality
on
November
00
,
0000
when
the
Rhode
Island
General
Assembly
authorized
the
residents
of
then
North
Glocester
to
elect
its
own
officers
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

This
town
was
named
for
00th
century
United
States
senator
James
Burrill
,
Jr.
who
was
then
the
Rhode
Island
Attorney
General
.

History
Burrilville
was
probably
first
settled
sometime
around
0000
,
when
the
first
Europeans
began
to
settle
the
Nipmuc
lands
.

The
Town
was
originally
a
part
of
Glocester
,
Rhode
Island
.

John
Smith
and
members
of
the
Saulsbury
family
were
among
the
earliest
settlers
.

Samuel
Willard
(
physician
)
treated
many
smallpox
victims
in
South
Uxbridge
and
Glocester
(
Burrillville
)
,
and
he
had
the
scars
to
prove
it
.

In
0000
,
The
Town
of
Burrillville
became
a
separate
town
and
consisted
of
of
land
in
the
northwest
corner
of
Rhode
Island
,
bordering
Connecticut
and
Massachusetts
.

Later
Boundary
disputes
with
Massachusetts
and
Glocester
reduced
this
land
area
by
the
mid-00th
century
.

Joktan
Putnam
was
the
first
Town
moderator
.

The
Nipmuc
word
for
snake
was
rendered
"
askug
"
by
Roger
Williams
in
his
A
Key
Into
the
Language
of
America
,
and
"
askoog
"
by
the
Reverend
John
Eliot
in
his
Algonqian
translation
of
the
Bible
.

Burrillville
's
principal
village
,
Pascoag
,
named
after
the
stream
upon
which
it
is
located
,
probably
derives
from
this
Algonqian
root
.

Gradually
in
the
early-to-mid-00th
century
,
the
various
mills
and
villages
took
shape
such
as
Harris
mills
,
and
the
village
of
Harrisville
,
Mapleville
mills
,
Oakland
mills
etc.
.

Buck
Hill
was
known
for
a
colorful
band
of
counterfeiters
.

The
town
is
today

Central
Falls
takes
its
name
from
a
waterfall
on
the
Blackstone
River
.

In
May
0000
,
Central
Falls
went
into
receivership
,
then
filed
for

As
it
is
immediately
north
of
Pawtucket
,
Rhode
Island
,
one
of
the
options
under
discussion
is
municipal
merger
.

History
Prior
to
the
arrival
of
Europe
ans
the
area
was
home
to
Nipmuc
,
Wampanoag
and
Narragansett
peoples
.

In
the
00th
century
,
Captain
Stephen
Jenks
built
a
trip
hammer
and
blacksmith
shop
along
the
Blackstone
River
,
forming
the
nucleus
of
what
would
eventually
become
Central
Falls
.

Other
manufacturers
,
including
a
chocolate
maker
,
set
up
shop
in
the
building
and
the
new
village
became
known
as
Chocolateville
.

In
0000
,
Stephen
Jenks
suggested
the
name
Central
Falls
,
thus
giving
the
village
its
permanent
name
.

Originally
,
Central
Falls
was
one
of
the
many
villages
within
the
town
of
Smithfield
,
but
in
0000
,
having
experienced
a
growth
spurt
,
it
split
into
three
smaller
towns
:
Smithfield
,
North
Smithfield
and
Lincoln
.

Central
Falls
then
became
part
of
the
town
of
Lincoln
.

Lincoln
experienced
its
own
growth
spurt
,
so
in
0000
Lincoln
split
into
two
towns
,
giving
birth
to
the
city
of
Central
Falls
.

While
Quaker
s
made
up
the
majority
of
the
first
European
settlers
in
the
area
,
they
were
soon
followed
by
a
diverse
mix
of
immigrants
from
Ireland
,
Scotland
and
French
Canada
.

By
the
00th
century
,
Central
Falls
had
experienced
its
own
population
explosion
and
for
a
while
was
the
most
densely
populated
city
in
the
United
States
.

In
recent
decades
,
a
large
number
of
Hispanic
immigrants
have
found
a
home
in
Central
Falls
.

Central
Falls
has
always
been
an
extremely
diverse
city
,
so
much
so
that
when
the
city
celebrated
its
000th
anniversary
with
a
parade
in

more
than

options

failing
schools

teachers
'
union
refused
to
accept
to
work
00
minutes
of
extra
time
under
the
"
transforming
model
"
,
so
the
superintendent
proceeded
and
chose
the
"
turnaround
model
"
,
which

a
district
to
fire
the
entire
staff
(
teachers

union
sued

school
district
,
challenging
the
requirement
that
teachers
must
reapply
for

jobs
.

The
Obama
administration
sided
with
the
school
board

Moreau
,
outlining
no-bid
contracts

kickbacks
from
a
high
school
friend
,
who
was
granted
almost
$
0,000,000
in
overpriced
property
boarding
fees
.

The
article
further
states
that
the
same
friend
gifted
him
a
$
0,000
furnace
for
his
own
home
for
only
$
0000
,
which
Moreau
said
he
paid
'

Cumberland
is
the
northeastern
most
town
in
Providence
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
United
States
,
first
settled
in
0000
and
incorporated
in
0000
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Cumberland
was
originally
settled
as
part
of
Rehoboth
,
Massachusetts
,
which
was
purchased
from
the
local
Native
Americans
by
the
Plymouth
Colony
.

It
was
later
transferred
to
Rhode
Island
as
part
of
a
long-running
boundary
dispute
.

The
town
was
named
in
honor
of
Prince
William
,
Duke
of
Cumberland
.

William
Blackstone
(
also
spelled
William
Blaxton
in
colonial
times
)
was
the
first
European
to
settle
and
live
in
Cumberland
.

(
He
was
also
the
first
European
to
have
settled
in
Boston
,
but
left
when
he
and
the
newly-arrived
Puritans
disagreed
about
religion
.
)

He
preached
his
brand
of
tolerant
Christianity
under
an
oak
tree
that
became
an
inspiration
to
Christians
worldwide
.

He
lived
on
a
farm
in
the
Lonsdale
area
of
Cumberland
,
where
he
cultivated
the
first
variety
of
American
apples
,
the
Yellow
Sweeting
.

The
site
of
his
home
is
now
occupied
by
the
Ann
&
Hope
mill
.

The
popular
tourist
destination
"
Nine
Men
's
Misery
"
is
a
tomb
found
on
the
grounds
of
a
former
Trappist
monastery
(
Abbey
of
Our
Lady
of
the
Valley
)
,
part
of
which
was
destroyed
in
a
fire
in
0000
.

The
Trappists
sold
the
monastery
and
grounds
to
the
town
and
part
of
the
building
was
converted
into
the
Edward
J.
Hayden
Library
,
aka
Cumberland
Public
Library
in
0000
.

This
combined
three
smaller
libraries
into
one
.

Cumberland
was
the
site
of
iron
works
that
made
cannons
and
cannon
balls
for
the
French
and
Indian
War
and
the
American
Revolution

,
which
is
the
original
antecedent
of
Berkshire
Hathaway
,
now
one
of
the

.

A
machine
shop
in
Cumberland
made

styles
differences
,
gifted
education
and
the
integration

History
In
0000
,
the
Plymouth
Colony
purchased
from
the
Indians
a
large
tract
of
land
which
today
includes
the
northern
half
of
East
Providence
(
from
Watchemoket
to
Rumford
)
,
Rehoboth
,
Seekonk
,
and
part
of
Pawtucket
.

Four
years
later
,
John
Brown
of
Plymouth
bought
a
considerably
smaller
piece
of
land
from
the
Indians
,
which
today
comprises
the
southern
part
of
East
Providence
(
Riverside
)
,
Barrington
,
and
a
small
part
of
Swansea
.

Finally
,
in
0000
,
Plymouth
completed
the
"
North
Purchase
"
from
which
Attleboro
,
North
Attleboro
,
and
Cumberland
were
later
formed
.

Over
the
whole
the
authorities
gave
the
name
'
Rehoboth
'
.

The
center
of
this
large
settlement
,
which
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
'
Old
Rehoboth
'
,
is
within
the
borders
of
modern
East
Providence
.

In
0000
,
the
western
half
of
Old
Rehoboth
was
set
off
as
a
separate
township
called
Seekonk
,
Massachusetts
.

Old
Rehoboth
's
town
center
now
became
the
heart
of
Old
Seekonk
.

Finally
,
in
0000
,
the
western
part
of
Old
Seekonk
was
ceded
to
Rhode
Island
and
incorporated
as
East
Providence
.

Watchemoket
In
decades
preceding
the
Civil
War
,
Watchemoket
Point
was
little
more
than
a
farming
and
fishing
area
with
perhaps
a
few
hundred
residents
.

Watchemoket
was
situated
directly
across
from
the
thriving
city
of
Providence
and
thus
benefited
from
the
expansion
of
that
community
.

More
importantly
,
two
bridges
across
the
Seekonk
River
gave
easy
access
to
Watchmemoket
.

By
the
0000s
,
tolls
were
no
longer
being
charged
to
cross
the
Washington
and
Central
Bridges
,
giving
further
stimulus
to
the
growth
of
Watchemoket
and
the
transformation
of
the
village
from
a
sleepy
fishing
area
to
the
vital
core
of
East
Providence
in
0000
.

Perhaps
the
first
businesses
to
come
to
Watchemoket
were
inns
built
to
service
the
large
numbers
of
people
coming
through
.

The
residents
of
Watchemoket
also
had
their
own
library
by
the
early
0000s
.

At
first
the
organizers
named
it
Ladies
Library
Association
,
but
in
0000
they
changed
the
named
to
Watchemoket
Free
Public
Library
.

Already
the
commercial
and
population
center
of
East
Providence
,
by
the
mid-0000s
,
Watchemoket
next
became
the
political
center
as
well
.

The
town
hall
was
moved
from
Rumford
to
the
heart
of
the
community
,
so
it
was
more
accessible
.

They
purchased
a
lot
on
Taunton
Avenue
for
$
00,000
and
erected
a
two-story
brick
building
which
opened
in
0000
.

That
same
year
the
East
Providence
Police
Department
opened
its
headquarters
in
the
town
hall
.

Beginning
around
0000
and
continuing
until
the
onset
of
the
Depression
in
0000
,
large
numbers
of
Portuguese
from
Providence
,
Fall
River
,
New
Bedford
,
and
Portugal
settled
in
East
Providence
.

By
0000
,
there
were
over
000
Portuguese
in
the
town
,
the
third
highest
in
the
state
.

The
Portuguese
,
like
other
ethnic
groups
,
were
drawn
to
East
Providence
primarily
by
the
lure
of
jobs
.

Many
employment
opportunities
were
available
in
the
Watchemoket
area
,
where
numerous
immigrants
settled
.

Rumford
For
some
time
after
the
incorporation
of
the
town
in
0000
,
the
area
around
the
old
"
Ring
of
the
Green
"
was
referred
to
as
East
Providence
Center
.

The
official
town
hall
was
located
here
until
0000
,
as
were
several
churches
.

Moreover
,
the
village
was
the
population
center
of
East
Providence
,
containing
many
farms
and
mills
along
the
Ten
Mile
River
.

Many
people
migrated
from
East
Providence
Center
to
the
new
center
at
Watchemoket
.

Riverside
From
the
time
of
the
Wannamoisett
purchase
in
0000
to
the
Civil
War
,
the
shore
land
from
Watchemoket
to
Bullocks
Point
had
remained
a
sparsely
settled
fishing
and
farming
area
.

When
East
Providence
was
incorporated
,
no
more
than
a
few
hundred
of
its
residents
made
the
coastal
village
their
home
.

The
white
settlers
had
first
learned
of
the
plentiful
supply
of
shellfish
in
the
area
from
the
Wampanoag
Indians
.

More
than
two
centuries
later
,
the
waters
of
Narragansett
Bay
,
which
washed
the
shores
of
Wannamoisett
,
still
contained
an
abundant
supply
of
edible
sea
treasures
.

Clams
,
quahogs
,
and
oysters
were
harvested
by
Wannamoisett
residents
and
sold
in
Providence
.

Arnold
Medberry
,
for
instance
,
brought
his
plow
to
the
shoreline
and
began
picking
up
clams
by
the
handful
.

He
loaded
the
shellfish
on
a
cart
and
easily
sold
his
entire
day
's
catch
in
Providence
.

At
that
time
,
Medberry
and
his
neighbors
were
referred
to
as
"
clamdiggers
"
,
a
derogatory
term
comparable
to
the
pejorative
hayseed
.

Already
,
by
the
early
nineteenth
century
,
individuals
had
begun
to
build
summer
homes
,
causing
the
population
to
double
to
about
000-000
.

During
that
time
period
,
Cedar
Grove
,
Lewis
Station
,
Chimney
Corners
,
Peck
's
Corner
,
Pleasant
Bluffs
,
Sabin
's
Point
,
Sherman
's
Station
,
and
Pomham
were
developed
.

New
resort
facilities
were
built
,
such
as
the
Pomham
House
.

Numbers
of
roads
were
lined
with
trees
and
houses
,
Christian
Churches
were
formed
,
a
library
was
built
,
and
the
Narragansett
Engine
Company
was
formed
in
0000
.

By
that
time
,
the
residents
were
no
longer
dismissed
as
"
clamdiggers
"
,
but
regarded
as
townspeople
.

While
many
transactions
were
taking
place
,
Charles
I.
D.
Looff
came
to
Riverside
.

He
was
a
wood
carver
for
a
furniture
business
in
New
York
,
and
spent
spare
time
in
his
basement
carveing
wooden
horses
as
a
hobby
.

After
long
years
of
hard
work
,
he
produced
the
first
steam
powered
carousel
and
sold
it
to
Crescent
Park
.

He
operated
the
carousel
and
designed
a
summer
recreation
area
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
New
Englanders
recognized
Crescent
Park
as
the
leading
amusement
park
in
the
region
.

Looff
accomplished
fantastic
achievements
and
,
after
his
death
,
his
family
continued
to
operate
Crescent
Park
.

.

History
In
the
00th
century
British
colonists
settled
in
North
Smithfield
developing
a
farming
community
that
they
named
after
Smithfield
,
London
in
England
.

The
town
was
part
of
Smithfield
,
Rhode
Island
until
it
was
incorporated
as
North
Smithfield
in
0000
.

The
first
colonization
occurred
after
a
Native
American
,
"
William
Minnian
,
(
or
Quashawannamut
)
"
of
Punkkupage
"
of
Massachusetts
Bay
on
May
00
,
0000
,
deeded
approximately
0,000
acres
"
to
John
Mowry
and
Edward
Inman
who
partnered
with
Nathaniel
Mowry
,
John
Steere
,
and
Thomas
Walling
in
dividing
up
the
purchased
tract
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
a
Quaker
colony
developed
in
what
is
now
North
Smithfield
(
then
Smithfield
)
,
which
extended
into
south
Uxbridge
,
Massachusetts
.

Today
North
Smithfield
is
part
of
the
John
H.
Chaffee
Blackstone
River
Valley
National
Heritage
Corridor
.

The
Blackstone
Valley
is
the
oldest
industrialized
region
in
the
U.S.
.

A
local
North
Smithfield
industry
today
,
Berroco
Yarns
,
is
a
continuation
of
an
original
family
owned
woolen
company
first
established
in
this
valley
by
Daniel
Day
in
0000
.

The
village
of
Slatersville
was
largely
built
by
Samuel
Slater
and
his
brother
John
Slater
beginning
in
0000
.

It
is
a
well
preserved
original
New
England
mill
village
with
worker
housing
and
commercial
buildings
.

This
village
is
in
fact
America
's
first
planned
industrial
mill
village
.

Samuel
and
John
's
family
owned
this
mill
and
the
village
until
the
turn
of
the
00th
to
the
00th
century
.

Union
Village
,
along
Rhode
Island
Route
000A
achieved
local
prominence
as
an
important
stagecoach
stop
on
the
route
along
Great
Road
.

Union
Village
was
also
home
to
a
hat
shop
,
taverns
,
an
academy
and
the
Union
Bank
from
which
the
village
got
its
name
.

In
the
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth-century
,
North
Smithfield
"
was
served
by
several
trolley
and
railroad
lines
;
now
all
are
gone
save
one
.

Pascoag
(
)
is
a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
and
village
in
Providence
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Pascoag
is
one
of
at
least
eight
villages
that
make
up
the
town
of
Burrillville
.

It
can
trace
its
origins
back
to
the
first
half
of
the
00th
century
,
when
a
saw
mill
and
other
businesses
were
built
in
what
is
now
the
village
center
.

The
Nipmuc
word
for
snake
was
rendered
"
askug
"
by
Roger
Williams
in
his
A
Key
Into
the
Language
of
America
,
and
"
askoog
"
by
the
Reverend
John
Eliot
in
his
Algonquian
translation
of
the
Bible
.

Burrillville
's
principal
village
,
Pascoag
,
named
after
the
stream
upon
which
it
is
located
,
probably
derives
from
this
Algonquian
root
.

In
the
00th
century
,
Pascoag
became
a
textile
manufacturing
town
,
an
industry
that
continued
until
after
World
War
II
.

From
0000
until
the
0000s
the
Woonsocket
and
Pascoag
Railroad
operated
trains
to
Pascoag
,
but
the
line
(
currently
operated
by
the
Providence
and
Worcester
Railroad
)
now
terminates
in
Slatersville
.

Recent
history
includes
an
incident
involving
groundwater
contamination
.

A
test
of
the
groundwater
conducted
on
September
00
,
0000
,
showed
that
the
water
contained
the
ether
MTBE
(
methyl
tertiary-butyl
ether
)
at
levels
of
over
000
ppb
(
parts
per
billion
)
.

This
was
the
first
public
statement
concerning
the
presence
of
MTBE
in
Pascoag
drinking
water
,
though
residents
claim
to
have
detected
it
as
early
as
May
0000
.

MTBE
is
a
gasoline
additive
intended
to
enhance
octane
levels
.

It
is
believed
to
have
come
from
leaking
tanks
at
a
local
Exxon
Mobil
gas
station
.

As
the
situation
was
resolved
over
the
following
months
,
nearly
0,000
residents
of
Pascoag
responded
by
filing
a
lawsuit
against
Exxon
Mobil
through
the
law
offices
of
Napoli
,
Kaiser
,
and
Bern
.

The
lawsuit
was
pending
as
of
May
0
,
0000
.

Geography
Pascoag
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

The
village
is
centered
around
the
Pascoag
River
at
its
outlet
from
the
Pascoag
Reservoir
.

The
river
drops
through
the
village
,
providing
ample
power
for
industry
in
the
village
's
early
days
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
CDP
has
a
total
area
of

Pawtucket
(
)
is
a

in
Providence
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the

census
.

It
is
the
fourth
largest
city
in
the
state
.

Pawtucket
borders
Providence
,
Rhode

.

History
Pawtucket
was
a
major
contributor
of
cotton
textiles
during
the
American
Industrial
Revolution
.

Slater
Mill
,
built
in
0000
by
Samuel
Slater
on
the
Blackstone
River
falls
in
downtown
Pawtucket
,
was
the
first
fully
mechanized
cotton
-
spinning
mill
in
America
.

Slater
Mill
is
known
for
developing
a
commercially
successful
production
process
not
reliant
on
earlier
horse-drawn
processes
developed
in
America
.

He
constructed
and
operated
machines
for
producing
yarn
.

Other
manufacturers
continued
,
transforming
Pawtucket
into
a
center
for
textile
s
,
iron
working
and
other
products
.

The
textile
business
in
New
England
declined
during
the
Great
Depression
with
many
manufacturers
closing
or
moving
their
facilities
South
where
operations
and
labor
were
cheaper
.

But
unlike
numerous
older
mill
town
s
in
the
region
,
Pawtucket
retained
much
of
its
industrial
base
.

Today
,
goods
produced
in
the
city
include
lace
,
non-woven
and
elastic
woven
materials

Once
East
Pawtucket
(

merged
.

The

Scituate
is
a
town
in
Providence
County
,
Rhode
Island
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Scituate
was
first
settled
in
0000
by
emigrants
from
Scituate
,
Massachusetts
.

The
original
spelling
of
the
town
's
name
was
"
Satuit
"
,
a
native
Indian
word
meaning
"
cold
brook
"
or
"
cold
river
.
"

The
town
was
a
part
of
Providence
until
0000
.

Scituate
's
first
town
meeting
was
held
at
the
Angell
Tavern
in
South
Scituate
,
with
Stephen
Hopkins
elected
as
the
first
moderator
and
Joseph
Brown
as
clerk
.

Stephen

later
became
a
governor
of
Rhode
Island
and
was
a
signer
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
.

His
brother
,
Esek
Hopkins
,
was
Commander
in
Chief
of
the
Continental
Navy
beginning
in
0000
.

In
0000
Scituate
representative
,
militia
general
and
Supreme
Court
Justice
William
West
led
an
armed
anti-federalist
mob
of
farmers
into
Providence
to
protest
the
U.S.
Constitution
.

In
0000
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
decided
its
first
case
,
West
v.
Barnes
,
regarding
a
farm
in
Scituate
.

Scituate

Scituate
.

Foster
was
incorporated
as
a
separate
town
in
0000
,
taking
the
western
half
of
Scituate
.

In
0000
,
the
Rhode

General
Assembly
voted
to
take

land
in
Scituate
(
00
%
of
the
town
)
to
create
a
reservoir
to
supply
fresh
water
to
greater
Providence
.

This
project
resulted
in
the
condemnation
of
"
0,000
buildings
,
including
000
houses
,
seven
schools
,
six
churches
,
six

Scituate
has
played
an
important
role
in
many
of
the
United
States
wars
.

During
the
Revolutionary
War
,
00
cannons
were
forged
at
the
Hope
Furnace
in
the
village
of
Hope
in
southern
Scituate
.

During
World
War
II
,
a
Federal
Communications
Commission
Signals
Intelligence
Division
facility
on
Darby
Road
on
Chopmist
Hill
(
)
intercepted
German
HF
communications
.

Because
of
this
,
in
0000
,
the
Chopmist
Hill
area
was
considered
as
a
candidate
for
the
location
of
the
headquarters
of
the
United
Nations
.

Geography
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
town
has
a
total
area
of
00.0
square
miles
(
000.0
km
²
)
,
of
which
,
00.0
square
miles
(
000.0

)
of
it
is
land
and
0.0
square
miles
(
00.0

)
of
it
(
00.00
%
)
is
water
.

Scituate
Reservoir
One
of
the
most
prominent
features
of
the
town
is
the
Scituate
Reservoir
.

The
large
reservoir
spans
a
large
portion
of
Scituate
and
has
forever
changed
the
face
of
the
town
.

During
construction
of
the
reservoir
,
numerous
villages
were
flooded
along
the
former
banks
of
the
Pawtuxet
River
.

Some
foundations
of
the
old
structures
are
still
visible
today
during
times
of
drought
.

The
reservoir
,
and
a
large
portion
of
land
surrounding
it
is
owned
and
maintained
by
the
Providence
Water
Supply
Board
.

The
main
Scituate
reservoir
was
formed
by
the
construction
of
a
dam
across
the
Pawtuxet
River
at
the
former
village
of
Kent
.

The
dam
,
principally
of
earth
,
is
about
long
and
high
.

Water
storage
in
the
reservoir
began
on
November
00
,
0000
.

An
aqueduct
from
the
dam
feeds
the
nearby
treatment
plant
which
was
placed
in
operation
on
September
00
,
0000
.

The
Scituate
Reservoir
is
the
largest
freshwater
body
of
water
in
the
state
of
Rhode
Island
.

It
has
an
aggregate
capacity
of
and
a
surface
area
of
0.0
square
miles
(
00.0
km
²
)
.

It
and
its
six
tributary
reservoirs
—
which
make
up
a
total
surface
area
of
0.0
square
miles
(
00.0
km
²
)
—
supply
drinking
water
to
more
than
00
percent
of
the
state
population
.

The
surrounding
drainage
basin
that
provides
water
to
the
reservoir
system
covers
an
area
of
about
00
square
miles
(
000.0
km
²
)
,
which
includes
most
of
the
town
of
Scituate
and
parts
of
Foster
,
Glocester
,
Johnston
,
and
Cranston
.

The
Scituate
Reservoir
is
operated
by
Providence
Water
Supply
Board
.

The
original
treatment
plant
was
state-of-the-art
at
the
time
of
its
construction
.

The
plant
was
considered
to
be
among
the
most
technologically
advanced
of
its
day
,
and
for
many
years
the
filtration
system
was
the
only
plant
of
its
type
in
New
England
.

As
demand
continued
to
grow
,
the
treatment
plant
underwent
major
expansions
and
renovations
in
the
0000s
and
again
in
the
'00s
.

Today
,
the
plant
has
a
maximum
treatment
capacity
of
of
water
per
day
and
still
remains
the
largest
treatment
facility
in
New
England
.

The

referred
to
itself
as
La
ville
la
plus
française
aux
États-Unis
–
the
most
French
city
in

United
States
.

History
Before
the
arrival
of
European
settlers
in
northern
Rhode
Island
during
the
00th
century
,
today
's
Woonsocket
region
was
inhabited
by
three
Native
American
tribes
—
the
Nipmuc
s
(
Cowesett
)
,
Wampanoags
,
and
Narragansetts
.

In
0000
,
the
English
theologian
Roger
Williams
purchased
the
area
from
the
"
Coweset
and
Nipmucks
,
"
and
in
a
letter
referred
to
modern
day
Woonsocket
as
"
Niswosakit
.
"

Other
possible
derivations
to
the
name
include
several
Nipmuc
geographic
names
from
nearby
Massachusetts
.

These
include
Woonksechocksett
,
from
Worcester
County
meaning
"
fox
country
,
"
and
Wannashowatuckqut
,
also
from
Worcester
County
,
meaning
"
at
the
fork
of
the
river
"
.

Another
theory
states
Woonsocket
derives
from
"
thunder
mist
,
"
in
reference
to
the
largest
waterfall
on
the
Blackstone
River
,
which
lies
at
the
center
of
the
city
.

Yet
another
theory
proposes
that
the
city
was
named
after
Woonsocket
Hill
in
neighboring
North
Smithfield
.

Woonsocket
Falls
Village
was
founded
in
the
0000s
.

Its
fortunes
expanded
as
the
Industrial
Revolution
took
root
in
nearby
Pawtucket
.

With
the
Blackstone
River
providing
ample
water
power
,
the
region
became
a
prime
location
for
textile
mills
.

Woonsocket
as
a
town
was
not
established
until
0000
when
three
villages
in
the
town
of
Cumberland
,
namely
Woonsocket
Falls
,
Social
and
Jenckesville
,
officially
became
the
town
of
Woonsocket
.

By
this
time
the
beginnings
of
the
French
Canadian
emigration
had
definitely
been
felt
.

In
0000
,
three
additional
industrial
villages
in
Smithfield
,
Hamlet
,
Bernon
and
Globe
,
were
added
to
the
town
establishing
its
present
boundaries
.

Woonsocket
was
incorporated
as
city
in
0000
.

During
the
Great
Depression
the
local
textile
industry
closed
,
causing
high
unemployment
.

At
this
point
00
percent
of
the
population
was
of
French-Canadian
descent
.

French-language
newspapers
were
published
and
sold
here
,
and
radio
programs
and
movies
shown
were
also
in
French
.

Most
conversations
in
public
were
also
in
French
.

The
city
's
fortunes
were
revived
in
World
War
II
,
when
it
became
a
center
of
fabric
manufacturing
for
the
war
effort
.

In
the
postwar
years
,
the
Woonsocket
economy
adjusted
to
a
mix
of
manufacturing
,
retail
,
technology
and
financial
services
operations
.

However
,
as
of
the
early
0000s
Woonsocket
was
again
plagued
by
high
unemployment
rates
.

In
0000
00
percent
of
Woonsocket
's
population
was
French-Canadian
descent
.

Beginning
in
0000
,
Woonsocket
became
home
to
Autumnfest
,
an
annual
cultural
festival
that
takes
place
on
Columbus
Day
Weekend
,
at
World
War
II
Veteran
's
Memorial
State
Park
.

It
has
become
one
of
the
city
's
most
popular
events
.

Environmental
Contamination
Bradford
is
a
working-class
village
in
southwest
Rhode
Island
where
the
Bradford
Dyeing
Association
(
BDA
)
has
operated
for
nearly
000
years
.

BDA
is
the
largest
producer
of
battle
dress
uniform
fabrics
to
the
U.S.
Dept.
of
Defense
.

In
violation
of
the
federal
Clean
Air
and
Clean
Water
Acts
,
the
BDA
plant
polluted
the
Pawcatuck
River
and
fouled
the
local
air
.

The
RI
DEM
(
Department
of
Environmental
Management
)
was
not
responding
to
local
complaints
about
the
contamination
so
the
Bradford
Coalition
0
Stop
Pollution
,
a
community
group
of
homeowners
and
tenants
,
lobbied
to
reduce
BDA
's
pollution
.

A
civil
lawsuit
was
successfully
filed
in
0000
in
collaboration
with
the
TAC
(
Toxic
Action
Center
)
,
RIPIRG
(
Rhode
Island
Public
Interest
Research
Group
)
and
Sierra
Club
.

The
BDA
settled
in
November
0000
,
agreeing
to
pay
$
000,000
in
fines
and
make
improvements
on
the
textile
mill
to
reduce
pollution
.

The
plant
will
build
taller
smokestacks
,
install
a
soot-reducing
device
and
better
manage
its
sewage
sludge
pond
.

Bradford
Dyeing
Association
has
never
built
the
smaller
smokestacks
.

“
State
and
federal
environmental
regulators
had
given
BDA
a
free
pass
for
years
,
”
explained
RIPIRG
Advocate
Matthew
Auten
.

“
By
requiring
the
company
to
significantly
upgrade
its
air
pollution
and
water
pollution
controls
,
this
settlement
demonstrates
the
important
role
that
citizens
can
and
often
must
play
in
enforcing
our
environmental
laws
.

”
Bradford
Dyeing
Association
has
had
two
fire
consistently
in

The
phrase

"
in

,
Verse

"
and
"
The
Friendliest
City
in
South
Carolina
.
"

Anderson
's
spirit
and
quality
of
life
has
earned

recognition
as
Anderson
County
was
named
an
"
All-America
City
"
in
0000
.

Anderson
is
the
home
of
Anderson
University
,
a
selective
private
comprehensive
university
of
approximately
0,000
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
.

History
Anderson
was
named
for
a
Revolutionary
War
hero
,
Robert
Anderson
.

General
Anderson
and
Andrew
Pickens
surveyed
the
land
in
the
area
.

The
Cherokees
lived
in
the
area
until
0000
.

The
land
was
then
ceded
to
South
Carolina
by
the
Cherokee
in
a
treaty
negotiated
by
Pickens
.

This
area
was
then
called
the
Pendleton
District
for
official
purposes
.

In
0000
,
the
Pendleton
District
was
divided
into
two
districts
—
Anderson
and
Pickens
.

Because
the
town
of
Pendleton
was
at
the
top
of
the
county
,
too
close
to
the
Pickens
border
,
a
new
courthouse
was
built
at
the
center
of
the
county
.

A
small
town
,
named
Anderson
Courthouse
,
built
around
the
courthouse
,
and
this
community
eventually
became
known
as
Anderson
.

Anderson
was
incorporated
by
an
act
of
Legislature
,
December
00
,
0000
.

The
original
courthouse
was
built
of
logs
,
but
00
years
later
,
a
courthouse
made
of
bricks
was
erected
to
replace
it
.

A
still-standing
Anderson
County
Courthouse
,
built
in
0000
,
now
faces
the
current
courthouse
and
is
built
on
the
site
of
the
original
.

The
settlers
of
this
area
were
mostly
Scots-Irish
who
came
from
Virginia
and
Pennsylvania
to
farm
.

Farmers
grew
corn
and
raised
hogs
.

Much
later
,
cotton
became
the
cash
crop
of
the
area
.

By
the
late
00th
century
,
the
Anderson
area
was
filled
with
numerous
textile
mills
.

Due
to
the
innovation
of
Anderson
engineer
William
Whitner
,
electricity
could
be
conducted
by
wire
to
mills
throughout
the
county
.

Anderson
was
the
first
city
in
the
United
States
to
have
a
continuous
supply
of
electric
power
,
which
was
supplied
by
a
water
mill
located
in
the
high
shoals
area
of
the
Rocky
River
in
Anderson
County
.

The
first
cotton
gin
in
the
world
to
be
operated
by
electricity
was
built
in
Anderson
County
in
0000
.

Several
areas
of
Anderson
are
named
in
Whitner
's
honor
,
including
a
downtown
street
.

Anderson
became
known
as
"
The
Electric
City
,
"
a
nickname
that
it
still
holds
today
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
famous
aviator
Amelia
Earhart
flew
into
the
Anderson
,
SC
airport
in
her
Pitcairn
PCA-0
Autogyro
,
attracting
over
0,000
spectators
.

Mayor
G.T.
McGregor
and
other
city
leaders
met
her
at
the
airport
.

She
was
piloting
the
Autogyro
on
a
nationwide
tour
promoting
Beech-Nut
products
.

Earhart
landed
at
the
original
Anderson
County
Airport
,
founded
in
0000
on
the
highest
land
Anderson
County
owned
.

This
"
airport
,
"
a
mere
grass
strip
originally
planned
as
an
emergency
landing
field
,
later
became
a
joint
city
county
facility
where
planes
delivering
air
mail
landed
.

The
field
functioned
until
the
land
for
the
current
airport
on
Highway
00
was
purchased
and
developed
in
the
mid-0000s
In
addition
,
Anderson
has
the
ideal
location
for
many
movie
sets
including
the
0000
filming
of

History
In
0000
a
group
was
created
to
connect
the
Piedmont
region
of
South
Carolina
by
rail
to
the
existing
rail
system
which
then
ran
from
Columbia
to
Charleston
.

The
expanded
rail
line
ran
through
what
was
to
become
Belton
,
with
a
spur
line
which
ran
to
the
nearby
town
of
Anderson
.

Because
of
the
population
explosion
that
occurred
by
the
time
the
railroad
had
been
completed
in
0000
,
the
state
incorporated
the
town
in
0000
,
with
the
boundaries
being
located
within
a
half
mile
radius
from
the
new
railroad
depot
.

The
city
was
given
the
name
of
Belton
after
the
first
president
of
the
Columbia
and
Greenville
Railroad
from
Newberry
,
John
Belton
O'Neal
.

The
city
prospered
not
only
due
to
the
railroad
junction
,
but
also
because
of
the
areas
cotton
crop
,
which
lead
to
the
establishment
of
cotton
mills
.

In

,
a

use
today
.

It
was
listed
on
the

Standpipe
Festival
,

Powdersville
is
a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
in
Anderson
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

For
many
decades
,
Powdersville
was
mainly
a
farming
community
.

In
recent
years
,
many
new
housing
subdivisions
and
businesses
along
S.C.
Highway
000
have
turned
Powdersville
into
a
bustling
suburban
area
.

Geography
Powdersville
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
CDP
has
a
total
area
of
00.0
square
miles
(
00.0
km
²
)
.00.0
square
miles
(
00.0

)
of
it
is
land
and
no
significant
bodies
of
water
are
present
.

History
According
to
local
legend
,
the
area
of
Powdersville
received
its
name
(
that
's
Powdersville
with
an
"
s
"
,
and
not
Powderville
)
because
the
general
stores
sold
gunpowder
and
the
powder
could
be
seen
spread
about
the
town
.

So
when
entering
the
town
,
people
would
say
,
"
This
must
be
Powdersville
.
"

Another
legend
about
how
Powdersville
got
its
name
is
that
the
area
was
used
for
gunpowder/ammo
storage
during
the
Civil
War
.

It
was
supposedly
stored
somewhere
near
the
old
Powdersville
Opry
House
.

An
alternative
theory
claims
that
the
area
was
a
stopping
point
for
lady
travelers
to
"
powder
"
their
nose
.

In
late
0000
,
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
began
allowing
"
Powdersville
"
to
be
used
for
mail
delivery
in
the
00000
(
Greenville
)
,
00000
(
Easley

and
00000

Powdersville
may
be
used
as
an
address
.

History
The
founding
of
Williamston
was
a
dream
come
true
for
West
Allen
Williams
.

One
day
in
0000
this
farmer
stopped
for
a
nap
while
riding
over
his
property
.

He
dreamed
of
a
clear
spring
with
healing
qualities
and
envisioned
pale
and
feeble
people
improving
miraculously
.

Upon
awakening
,
he
followed
a
trickling
sound
and
discovered
the
source
of
the
Williamston
mineral
spring
.

As
news
of
the
medicinal
water
spread
,
the
town
grew
and
became
a
major
resort
when
the
railroads
arrived
in
0000
.

Soon
it
became
known
as
the
'
Saratoga
of
the
South
'
which
was
a
referral
to
a
similar
spring
in
New
York
.

To
accommodate
the
influx
,
the
Mammoth
Hotel
was
built
near
the
spring
and
was
the
largest
building
in
the
state
at
that
time
,
featuring
000
rooms
plus
bowling
alleys
and
ballrooms
.

Unfortunately
,
a
devastating
fire
in
0000
destroyed
it
and
other
buildings
.

The
town
was
initially
known
as
Mineral
Springs
,
but
this
was
changed
to
Williamston
in
0000
.

Mr.
Williams
set
aside
property
to
preserve
the
spring
and
to
begin
schools
and
churches
.

The
Civil
War
brought
an
end
to
that
“
golden
era
”
,
but
not
without
leaving
its
own
history
.

The
last
skirmish
east
of
the
Mississippi
took
place
a
few
miles
north
of
town
when
cadets
from
the
Arsenal
Academy
at
Columbia
encountered
Stoneman
’s
Raiders
on
May
0
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
Dr.
Samuel
Lander
established
a
girls
school
which
eventually
moved
to
the
city
of
Greenwood
,
and
became
Lander
University
.

Dr.
Lander
was
instrumental
in
prohibiting
the
sale
of
liquor
in
town
,
a
feeling
which
exists
today
in
this
community
served
by
more
than
00
churches
.

Around
the
turn
of
the
century
the
cotton
mills
settled
near
the
river
and
played
major
roles
in
shaping
the
communities
.

Many
families
still
treasure
memories
of
events
sponsored
by
the
mills
and
of
teams
playing
in
the
old
textile
leagues
.

Shoeless
Joe
Jackson
took
his
first
steps
on
Pelzer
’s
mill
hill
and
went
on
to
become
the
greatest
natural
baseball
player
ever
.

Railroads
continued
to
serve
the
area
until
the
0000s
.

The
P
&
N
was
designed
to
operate
through
the
heart
of
the
Piedmont
textile
industry
and
is
remembered
by
its
motto
“
A
Mill
to
the
Mile
”
and
by
its
rate
of
a
penny
a
mile
.

With
today
’s
dominance
of
auto
transportation
,
Williamston
is
blessed
with
highways
0
,
00
,
and
00
leading
its
citizens
to
upstate
corridors
including
nearby
Interstate

History
Denmark
,
Bamberg
County
,
South
Carolina
,
came
into
being
as
a
railroading
village
of
the
earlier
name
of
Graham
's
Turnout
.

An
early
pioneer
planter
by
the
name
of
Zachary
"
Big
Zack
"
Graham
was
asked
by
the
South
Carolina
Canal
and
Rail
Road
Company
to
allow
the
new
railroading
company
,
which
began
in
0000
,
to
use
some
of
his
vast
acreage
in
the
area
,
which
was
back
then
the
Barnwell
District
(
which
after
the
War
Between
the
States
became
today
's
Bamberg
County
)
for
the
use
of
his
railroad
's
tracks
.

The
South
Carolina
Canal
and
Rail
Road
Company
had
plans
to
lay
their
tracks
from
the
eastern
most
terminal
at
Charleston
,
S.
C.
,
and
to
continue
to
the
western
most
terminal
at
Hamburg
,
S.
C.
on
the
eastern
banks
of
the
Savannah
River
opposite
Augusta
,
Georgia
.

Once
the
SCCRR
Company
's
tracks
reached
the
Savannah
River
banks
in
Hamburg
,
it
resulted
in
becoming
the
longest
(
over
000
miles
)
scheduled
passenger
and
freight
railroad
in
the
world
.

The
company
's
very
first
steam
locomotive
,
built
in
the
U.S.A.
,
was
named
"
The
Best
Friend
of
Charleston
"
,
and
it
made
its
first
run
from
Charleston
to
Hamburg
,
S.
C.
,
in
December
0000
.

Graham
's
Turnout
was
one
of
the
stations
,
or
turnouts
,
on
the
trip
to
Hamburg
from
Charleston
.

Midway
,
Bamberg
County
,
South
Carolina
,
was
the
approximate
half-way
point
of
the
trip
,
where
the
weary
passengers
could
have
a
meal
at
the
new
eating
place
there
,
and
,
even
take
advantage
of
the
new
hotel
.

Many
new
railroading
villages
such
as
Graham
's
Turnout
and
Midway
began
to
incorporate
and
develop
along
the
000
mile
plus
length
of
the
new
South
Carolina
Canal
and
Rail
Road
Company
's
transportation
facilities
.

The
name
of
Graham
's
Turnout
later
,
upon
incorporation
as
a
town
,
changed
to
Graham
's
,
S.
C.
,
and
,
as
a
second
railroading
company
intersected
the
east-west
tracks
,
with
their
new
north-south
line
—
The
South
Bound
Rail
Road
Company
—
the
"
old
town
"
location
of
Graham
's
began
to
migrate
to
the
west
about
a
mile
,
or
so
,
to
locate
at
the
intersection
of
the
two
major
railroad
companies
'
tracks
and
"
Union
Depot
"
.

At
this
time
,
the
"
new
town
"
community
named
its
town
Denmark
,
S.
C.
,
in
honor
of
a
Captain
Denmark
,
who
was
an
official
and
promoter
of
The
South
Bound
Railroad
.

The
citizens
of
the
area
recognized
the
wonderful
advantages
in
the
fields
of
society
,
transportation
,
economics
,
and
local
advancement
,
which
were
provided
by
Captain
Denmark
of
Georgia
and
his
railroad
company
.

The
"
old
town
"
area
of
the
former
Graham
's
,
then
became
known
as
"
Sato
"
,
in
honor
of
a
Japanese
military
hero
of
those
days
.

And
,
therefore
"
Sato
"
was
now
just
a
section
of
"
new
town
"
Denmark
,
Bamberg
County
,
South
Carolina
.

History
On

,
0000
,
a
band
of
British
Loyalist
fought
with
a
group
of
local
Patriots
two
miles
north
of
the
Blackville
,
SC
.

The
location
,
called
Windy
Hill
at
that
time
,
is
slightly
east
of
the
present
day
Healing
Springs
Park
and
Church
.

The
Commanding
Officer
was
Captain
Benjamin
Odom
,
Jr.
who
was
a
member
of
Colonel
William
Harden
’s
Regiment
.

Sixteen
Patriots
were
killed
.

Major
“
Bloody
Bill
”
Cunningham
’s
Major
“
Bloody
Bill
”
Cunningham
was
believed
to
be
the
Commander
of
the
Tory
Company
.

The
area
was
known
for
many
years
as
"
Slaughter
Hill
"
.

Two
other
Revolutionary
battles
were
fought
in
what
is
now
Barnwell
County
,
the
Battle
of
Morris
Ford
and
the
Battle
of
Red
Hill
.

In
0000
the
district
was
named
Winton
County
and
formed
out
of
Orangeburg
District
,
.

It
was
formed
to
create
another
Judicial
circuit
.

It
was
given
its
current
name
in
0000
when
the
County
and
its
seat
were
named
for
Revolutionary
War
leader
John
Barnwell
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
who
headed
a
militia
in
South
Carolina
.

Barnwell
County
originally
stretched
from
the
Savannah
River
on
the
west
almost
to
the
Atlantic
Ocean
.

Built
in
0000
,
the
South
Carolina
Railroad
connected
Charleston
to
Hamburg
,
near
Augusta
,
Georgia
on
the
Savannah
River
.

The
railroad
,
which
went
through
the
middle
of
the
county
,
was
the
first
steam
railroad
in
the
world
.

Two
stops
on
the
railroad
created
the
towns
of
Blackville
,
South
Carolina
and
Williston
in
the
mid-nineteenth
century
.

Barnwell
is
home
to
what
is
thought
to
be
the
only
vertical
freestanding
sundial
in
the
USA
,
though
counter-examples
exist
.

The
Barnwell
sundial
was
surrounded
by
a
parking
lot
in
the
0000s
but
in
the
0000s
the
city
removed
the
parking
lot
,
built
a
park
,
and
made
the
sundial
a
focal
point
.

Civil
War
Barnwell
gave
generously
to
the
Confederate
cause
;
the
most
distinguished
person
was
General
Johnson
Hagood
,
who
was
later
governor
of
South
Carolina
.

Soon
after
Hagood
's
election
,
one
of
his
constituents
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
be
called
"
General
"
or
"
Governor
"
.
"

Call
me
General
,
"
Hagood
said
,
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
,
"
I
fought
for
that
and
begged
for
the
other
.
"

Barnwell
was
hated
by
General
W.T.
Sherman
;
he
felt
that
the
town
should
be
burnt
to
the
ground
since
it
carried
the
name
of
one
of
the
most
prominent
politicians
who
had
demanded
South
Carolina
’s
withdrawal
from
the
Union
.

When
General
Judson
Kilpatrick
was
in
Barnwell
,
his
horses
were
stabled
in
the
Episcopal
Church
of
the
Holy
Apostles
;
the
font
in
the
church
was
used
to
water
the
horses
.

00th
century
Barnwell
Army
Airfield
w
as
built
by
the
United
States
Army
Air
Forces
and
opened
in
May
0000
.

It
was
a
satellite
airfield
of
Columbia
Army
Air
Base
,
supporting
B-00
Mitchell
medium
bomber
training
for
Third
Air
Force
III
Air
Support
Command
.

After
the
war
it
became
Barnwell
Regional
Airport
.

In
0000
the
federal
government
asked
DuPont
to
build
and
operate
a
plutonium
production
plant
near
the
Savannah
River
in
South
Carolina
.

The
company
had
unmatched
expertise
in
atomic
energy
,
having
designed
and
built
the
plutonium
production
complex
at
the
Hanford
site
,
for
the
Manhattan
Project
during
World
War
II
.

A
large
portion
of
farmland
was
bought
under
eminent
domain
and
converted
to
the
Savannah
River
Plant
,
managed
by
the
U.S.
Atomic
Energy
Commission
.

Several
towns
and
over
000
cemeteries
were
relocated
during
this
time
,
including
Dunbarton
and
Ellenton
.

Dunbarton
was
the
town
in
which
Duncannon
was
located
;
it
was
an
early
00th
century
plantation
and
a
wildlife
preserve
.

Former
President
George
H.
W.
Bush
and
his
brothers
used
to
visit
their
grandfather
George
Herbert
Walker
at
the
plantation
.

Union
General
William
T.
Sherman
allegedly
spared
the
plantation
,
built
in
0000
,
because
a
woman
and
sick
child
were
resting
in
a
bedroom
upstairs
.

U.S.
Army
soldiers
were
brought
into
the
county
and
were
used
as
guards
at
this
new
facility
.

A
camp
was
constructed
for
the
soldiers
off
of
Clinton
Street
,
earning
it
the
name
"
Barracks
Road
"
among
locals
,
in
an
area
of
the
Little
Salkehatchie
swamp
called
O’Bannon
Point
.

After
discharge
,
many
of
these
troops
stayed
on
at
SRP
as
civilian
guards
.

DuPont
ran
the
Savannah
River
Site
until
0000
,
when
Westinghouse
began
the
management
of
the
facilities
for
the
Department
of
Energy
.

The
Savannah
River
Plant
changed
its
name
to
the
Savannah
River
Site
.

It
was
once
one
of
the
largest
employers
in
the
county
.

.

The
chapel
of
Saint

in
Barnwell
County
.

It

.

The
sundial
is
a
unique
vertical
monument
placed
in
front
of
the
courthouse
of
Barnwell
County
.

It

given
to
Barnwell
in
0000
by
Joseph
D.
Allen
,
at
the
time
a
state
senator
from
Barnwell
.

It
is
thought
to
be
the
only
free-standing

History
The
Lowcountry
region
had
been
subject
to
numerous
European
explorations
and
failed
attempts
at
colonization
before
the
British
founded
the
city
in
0000
.

The
city
initially
grew
slowly
,
subject
to
numerous
attacks
from
Native
American
tribes
and
threats
of
Spanish
invasion
.

It
flourished
first
as
a
center
for
shipbuilding
and
later
,
when
the
colony
was
established
as
a
slave
society
,
as
the
elite
center
for
the
Lowcountry
planters
through
the
Civil
War
.

Several
months
after
hostilities
began
between
the
states
,
Beaufort
was
occupied
by
Union
forces
following
the
Battle
of
Port
Royal
.

Due
in
part
to
its
early
occupation
,
the
city
attracted
escaping
slaves
.

The
Union
declared
the
slaves
emancipated
and
initiated
efforts
at
education
and
preparation
for
full
independence
.

The
Freedman
's
Bureau
worked
with
local
blacks
during
Reconstruction
.

After
the
war
,
the
city
relied
on
phosphate
mining
before
a
devastating
hurricane
in
0000
and
a
fire
in
0000
brought
extensive
destruction
and
economic
turmoil
.

Their
effects
slowed
growth
of
the
city
for
nearly
half
a
century
.

In
the
latter
half
of
the
twentieth
century
,
the
community
became
a
destination
for
tourists
.

It
also
benefited
by
the
growth
of
military
installations
in
the
area
and
related
employment
.

Local
groups
have
worked
to
preserve
Beaufort
's
historic
character
and
significant
architecture
.

Geography
Beaufort
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
is
amid
a
marshy
estuary
,
and
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
is
land
and
(
00.00
%
)
is
water
.

The
majority
of
the
city
is
situated
upon
Port
Royal
Island
,
an
interior
Sea
Island
that
the
city
shares
with
neighboring
Port
Royal
and
unincorporated
portions
of
Beaufort
County
.

The
city
has
also
annexed
lands
across
the
Beaufort
River
on
Lady
's
Island
.

Neighborhoods
Historic
District
Remnants
of
the
original
English
colonial
settlement
of
Beaufort
can
be
found
in
the
downtown
or
historic
district
area
.

of
the
town
have
been
designated
a
National
Historic
Landmark
.

With
approximate
dimensions
,
downtown
is
defined
as
anything
upon
the
peninsula
jutting
into
the
Beaufort
River
that
is
located
east
of
Ribaut
Road
(
US
00
)
.

Further
defined
,
downtown
is
broken
into
five
distinct
historic
neighborhoods
:
Downtown
(
the
commercial
core
)
,
The
Point
(
also
known
as
the
Old
Point
)
,
The
Bluff
,
The
Old
Commons
,
and
the
Northwest
Quadrant
.

Other
residential
areas
As
the
city
expanded
in
the
00th
century
,
additional
growth
focused
on
previously
undeveloped
areas
north
and
west
of
the
historic
district
.

Much
of
the
growth
can
be
attributed
to
the
increased
military
influence
during
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
in
which
Beaufort
's
population
doubled
as
a
result
of
new
military
personnel
and
families
moving
to
the
area
.

These
areas
have
since
become
integral
parts
of
the
city
and
today
are
home
to
the
majority
of
the
residents
in
the
city
.

The
Pigeon
Point
and
Higginsonville
neighborhoods
are
located
immediately
north
of
Downtown
Beaufort
and
are
built
around
the
Beaufort
National
Cemetery
.

They
contain
two
major
city
parks
:
Pigeon
Point
Community
Park
and
the
Basil
Green
Recreation
Complex
.

An
area
with
smaller
homes
and
mostly
one-story
early
00th
century
structures
,
Pigeon
Point
has
experienced
a
renewal
of
development
interest
,
with
many
homes
being
"
flipped
"
or
renovated
in
recent
years
.

Higginsonville
is
more
similar
in
character
to
the
Northwest
Quadrant
neighborhood
and
has
its
street
names
come
from
famous
abolitionists
during
the
Civil
War
era
.

The
West
End
and
Depot
neighborhoods
are
located
west
of
Ribaut
Road
,
south
of
Boundary
Street
and
north
of
the
Technical
College
of
the
Lowcountry
campus
.

These
areas
have
been
the
focus
of
recent
redevelopment
efforts
.

Formerly
concentrated
around
the
Beaufort
rail
station
(
the
depot
)
,
the
neighborhoods
have
similar
characteristics
to
the
Pigeon
Point
area
and
have
a
sizable
number
of
military
families
as
residents
.

The
Spanish
Point
neighborhood
is
located
between
Downtown
and
Mossy
Oaks
,
generally
considered
to
be
clustered
around
the
Technical
College
of
the
Lowcountry
campus
and
the
Beaufort
Memorial
Hospital
.

Several
upscale
residential
streets
are
typical
characteristics
of
this
area
.

The
Battery
Creek
neighborhoods
of
Mossy
Oaks
,
Royal
Oaks
,
First
Boulevard
,
and
Cottage
Farms
form
the
southern
residential
areas
of
the
city
and
are
generally
considered
to
be
south
of
the
Technical
College
of
the
Lowcountry
campus
and
the
Beaufort
Memorial
Hospital
.

There
are
some
commercial
establishments
in
the
area
in
addition
to
residential
subdivisions
ranging
from
self-contained
attached
housing
to
residential
estate
lots
of
.

Portions
of
Lady
's
Island
have
been
annexed
by
Beaufort
,
though
the
city
does
not
have
complete
jurisdiction
of
the
entire
island
.

Most
of
the
incorporated
areas
are
upscale
residential
communities
.

Both
Beaufort
High
School
and
the
Beaufort
County
Airport
are
located
on
the
island
.

Other
non-residential
areas
Once
the
outer
edge
of
town
,
the
areas
along
Boundary
Street
(
US
Highway
00
)
,
Robert
Smalls
Parkway
(
SC
Highway
000
)
,
and
Ribaut
Road
now
serve
as
Beaufort
's
major
commercial
corridors
.

Several
major
shopping
centers
and
dining
establishments
are
prevalent
in
all
three
areas
.

Beyond
shopping
and
dining
,
Ribaut
Road
has
numerous
medical
offices
clustered
near
Beaufort
Memorial
Hospital
.

Boundary
Street
and
Robert
Smalls
Parkway
have
several
lodging
facilities
and
auto
dealerships
as
prevailing
business
types
.

Boundary
Street
is
subject
to
change
its
appearance
over
the
coming
years
due
in
part
to
a
major
redevelopment
plan
approved
by
the
city
in
0000
and
supported
via
tax
increment
financing
.

Uptown
Beaufort
refers
to
a
series
of
mostly
commercial
properties
along
Boundary
Street
,
which
separates
the
historic
district
from
the
Pigeon
Point
neighborhood
.

Uptown
is
not
formally
considered
a
neighborhood
on
its
own
,
yet
merchants
have
created
a
unique
identity
to
market
the
commercial
area
separately
from
downtown
merchants
clustered
on
Bay
Street
.

Beaufort
Town
Center
is
a
recent
term
given
to
a
series
of
developments
along
Boundary
Street
located
west
of
the
historic
district
and
Pigeon
Point
that
is
clustered
near
the
Beaufort
County
government
complex
and
the
City
of
Beaufort
's
municipal
complex
construction
site
.

Though
much
of
the
area
(
and
the
term
)
is
owned
by
a
single
developer
,
many
of
Beaufort
's
commercial
properties
and
administrative
uses
have
moved
to
this
area
.

The
Marine
Corps
Air
Station
Beaufort
was
annexed
into
the
city
in
the
0000s
,
expanding
the
city
limits
northward
near
the
unincorporated
Seabrook
community
.

Previous
attempts
at
bringing
large-scale
residential
development
north
of
the
air
station
were
defeated
after
protests
from
long-time
citizens
and
environmental
advocacy
groups
.

Economy
The
location
of
the
City
to
other
fast
growing
areas
including
Hilton
Head
Island
,
and
Bluffton
as
well
as
good
access
to
Savannah
,
Georgia
,
the
Savannah-Hilton
Head
International
Airport
,
and
a
future
container
port
to
be
built
on
the
Savannah
River
make
the
city
a
desirable
choice
for
residential
and
business
development
opportunity
.

Beaufort
has
several
geographic
areas
of
economic
activity
.

The
downtown
area
is
the
historical
center
of
commerce
and
is
now
primarily
focused
towards
visitors
,
tourists
.

Much
of
the
day-to-day
service
businesses
for
locals
has
moved
along
the
Boundary
Street
corridor
,
the
Robert
Smalls
Parkway
corridor
,
or
towards
Lady
's
Island
.

There
are
several
areas
with
limited
industrial
uses
that
exist
primarily
in
the
northwestern
sections
of
the
city
,
close
to
the
intersection
of
Boundary
Street
with
Robert
Smalls
Parkway
.

The
largest
economic
sector
in
Beaufort
is
the
military
presence
in
and
around
the
community
.

Having
supplanted
agriculture
and
aquaculture
in
the
last
decades
of
the
00th
century
,
Beaufort
's
military
bases
employ
thousands
of
jobs
directly
and
indirectly
related
to
base
operations
and
pump
millions
of
dollars
into
the
local
economy
.

As
a
result
,
economic
downturns
do
not
hit
the
community
as
hard
as
in
other
similarly
sized
communities
.

Due
in
part
to
its
attractive
location
and
deep
connections
with
history
and
culture
,
the
tourism
and
hospitality
industry
is
also
a
major
economic
sector
.

Nearly
two
million
visitors
a
year
come
to
Beaufort
and
the
Sea
Islands
of
northern
Beaufort
County
,
with
spring
and
fall
seasons
being
peak
times
.

The
primary
attractions
of
these
visitors
include
golf
and
beach
vacations
,
history
,
water
sports
,
and
local
arts
and
crafts
.

As
a
result
,
Beaufort
is
home
to
many
accommodation
options
ranging
from
upscale
bed-and-breakfasts
in
the
downtown
area
to
standard
motels
and
inns
along
Boundary
Street
.

There
are
several
dozen
dining
establishments
in
the
city
that
cater
to
locals
and
tourists
alike
.

Other
sectors
of

are

owner
of
the
land
was
the
Barbadian
planter
Sir
John
Colleton
.

Following
the
departure
of
the
Yamasee
people
,
colonists
began
building
plantations
in
the
Bluffton
area
in
0000
.

The
Colletons
prospered
by
growing
cotton
,
corn
and
indigo
.

American
Revolution
(
0000
–
0000
)
Before
his
death
in
0000
,
Sir
John
Colleton
had
disposed
of
much
of
his
Barony
,
much
of
it
bought
by
the
Rose
and
Kirk
families
.

During
the
00th
century
,
much
of
the
land
south
of
the
May
River
(
now
known
as
Palmetto
Bluff
)
was
covered
with
rice
fields
.

Rice
became
a
lucrative
crop
and
a
part
of
lowcountry
culture
until
the
early
00th
century
when
it
was
disrupted
by
a
series
of
devastating
storms
.

Antebellum
era
(
0000
–
0000
)
The
Town
of
Bluffton
was
eventually
built
on
two
adjoining
parcels
in
the
Devil
's
Elbow
Barony
purchased
by
Benjamin
Walls
and
James
Kirk
.

The
first
homes
were
constructed
during
the
early
0000s
by
area
plantation
owners
seeking
the
high
ground
and
cool
river
breezes
as
an
escape
from
the
unhealthy
conditions
present
on
Lowcountry
rice
and
cotton
plantations
.

Easy
access
by
water
provided
more
incentive
for
expansion
and
the
many
tidal
coves
afforded
excellent
locations
for
residences
.

The
community
was
originally
known
as
"
Kirk
's
Landing
"
or
"
Kirk
's
Bluff
"
as
shown
in
Mill
's
Atlas
of
0000
.

The
first
streets
were
formally
laid
out
during
the
0000s
and
the
name
of
Bluffton
decided
upon
in
the
early
0000s
as
a
compromise
between
the
Kirk
and
Pope
families
.

The
first
South
Carolina
secession
movement
began
under
what
is
now
known
as
the
Secession
Oak
tree
,
led
by
R.
Barnwell
Rhett
on
July
00
,
0000
.

In
the
0000s
a
steamboat
landing
was
built
at
the
end
of
Calhoun
Street
and
Bluffton
became
the
commercial
center
of
southern
Beaufort
county
as
a
stopover
for
travelers
between
Savannah
and
Beaufort
.

In
0000
the
Town
was
officially
incorporated
by
an
act
of
the
South
Carolina
General
Assembly
and
comprised
approximately
one
square
mile
.

The
iconic
Church
of
the
Cross
was
designed
by
architect
Edward
Brickell
White
to
seat
up
to
000
parishioners
at
a
cost
of
$
0,000
and
construction
began
in
0000
.

On
July
00
,
0000
the
first
services
were
held
at
the
Church
of
the
Cross
.

Civil
War
(
0000
–
0000
)
Within
one
year
of
the
capture
of
Fort
Sumter
,
Bluffton
became
a
safe
haven
for
residents
fleeing
Union
occupation
of
the
South
Carolina
barrier
islands
.

The
Church
of
the
Cross
bell
was
sent
to
England
via
Charleston
to
be
melted
to
aid
the
war
effort
,
however
it
was
later
discovered
to
be
hanging
in
Porter
Military
Academy
and
returned
years
later
.

Bluffton
was
a
headquarters
for
Confederate
forces
until
Union
forces
on
Hilton
Head
Island
ordered
the
Town
's
destruction
in
0000
.

Approximately
00
structures
were
in
the
Town
before
the
attack
,
only
the
Town
's
two
churches
and
fifteen
residences
remained
standing
after
the
attack
.

Postbellum
era
(
0000
–
0000
)
Rebuilding
came
slowly
as
few
local
landowners
could
still
afford
the
luxury
of
a
summer
home
in
Bluffton
.

The
Town
did
not
experience
a
true
rebuilding
until
the
0000s
,
when
the
Town
emerged
as
a
commercial
center
for
Beaufort
County
.

Contemporary
era
(
0000
–
present
)
The
Town
remained
a
commercial
center
until
Coastal
Highway
(
US
00
)
and
the
bridge
at
Port
Wentworth
over
the
Savannah
River
were
completed
,
making
riverboat
trade
and
travel
less
attractive
.

The
Great
Depression
,
beginning
shortly
thereafter
,
brought
the
closure
of
the
Town
's
prosperity
and
commercial
importance
.

The
popularity
of
the
Town
as
a
vacation
spot
remained
even
after
its
loss
of
commercial
stature
.

The
development
of
Hilton
Head
Island
,
nearby
Sun
City
,
and
related
development
in
the
0000s
caused
a
resurgence
of
commercial
activity
in
the
Town
.

In
0000
Bluffton
was
designated
a
National
Historic
District
with
00
contributing
buildings
and
0
contributing
sites
.

In
0000
The
Heyward
House
opened
to
the
public
by
the
Bluffton
Historical
Preseveration
Society
.

In
0000
the
Heyward
House
was
part
of
the
Save
America
's
Treasures
program
.

The
Heyward
House
became
the
town
's
welcome
center
in
0000
and
the
Old
Town
Bluffton
historic
district
was
established
through
zoning
regulations
and
architectural
standards
.

In
0000
,
Bluffton
was
recognized
as
a
Preserve
America
Community
,
a
federal
program
that
encourages
community
efforts
to
preserve
the
nation
's
cultural
and
historical
assets
.

Geography
Bluffton
was
once
mostly
wetlands
,
many
were
drained
possibly
during
the
antebellum
era
.

Agriculture
and
pine
timber
harvesting
contributed
to
the
landscape
still
present
today
.

The
town
proper
consists
of
five
primary
areas
.

The
historic
district
of
Old
Town
,
on
the
northern

of
the
May
River
.

through
the
center
of

municipality
in

by

area

The

Until
the
00st
century
,
most
of
Bluffton
was
undeveloped
land
until
the
housing
boom
of
the
early

which
led
to
explosive
growth
in
Bluffton
's
area
.

Many
of
Bluffton
's
planned
unit
developments
were
built
during
this
time

many
of
these
developments
remain
partially
complete
due
to
the
economic
downturn

Hilton
Head
Island
is
a
primary
city
within
the
Hilton
Head
Island
-
Bluffton
-
Beaufort
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
island
has
a
rich
history
that
started
with
seasonal
occupation
by
native
Americans
thousands
of
years
ago
,
and
continued
with
European
exploration
and
the
Sea
Island
Cotton
trade
.

It
became
an
important
base
of
operations
for
the
Union
blockade
of
the
Southern
ports
during
the
Civil
War
.

Once
the
island
fell
to
Union
troops
,
hundreds
of
ex-slaves
flocked
to
Hilton
Head
,
which
is
still
home
to
many
'
native
islanders
'
,
many
of
whom
are
descendants
of
freed
slaves
known
as
the
Gullah
(
or
Geechee
)
who
have
managed
to
hold
onto
much
of
their
ethnic
and
cultural
identity
.

The
Town
of
Hilton
Head
Island
incorporated
as
a
municipality
in
0000
and
is
well
known
for
its
"
eco-friendly
"
development
.

The
town
's
Natural
Resources
Division
enforces
the
Land
Management
Ordinance
which
minimizes
the
impact
of
development
and
governs
the
style
of
buildings
and
how
they
are
situated
amongst
existing
trees
.

As
a
result
,
Hilton
Head
Island
enjoys
an
unusual
amount
of
tree
cover
relative
to
the
amount
of
development
.

Approximately
00
%
of
the
island
,
including
most
of
the
tourist
areas
,
is
located
inside
gated
communities
.

However
,
the
town
maintains
several
public
beach
access
points
,
including
one
for
the
exclusive
use
of
town
residents
,
who
have
approved
several
multi-million
dollar
land-buying
bond
referendums
to
control
commercial
growth
.

Hilton
Head
Island
offers
an
unusual
number
of
cultural
opportunities
for
a
community
its
size
,
including
Broadway-quality
plays
at
the
Arts
Center
of
Coastal
Carolina
,
the
000-member
full
chorus
of
the
Hilton
Head
Choral
Society
,
the
highly-rated
Hilton
Head
Symphony
Orchestra
,
the
largest
annual
outdoor
,
tented
wine
tasting
event
on
the
east
coast
,
and
several
other
annual
community
festivals
.

It
also
hosts
the
Heritage
Golf
Classic
,
a
stop
on
the
PGA
Tour
which
is
played
on
the
Harbour
Town
Golf

History
Early
history
An
ancient
shell
ring
can
be
seen
near
the
east
entrance
to
the
Sea
Pines
Forest
Preserve
.

The
ring
,
one
of
only
00
in
existence
,
is
in
diameter
and
is
believed
to
be
over
00,000
years
old
.

Archeologists
believe
that
the
ring
was
a
refuse
heap
,
created
by
Indians
that
lived
in
the
interior
of
the
ring
,
which
was
kept
clear
and
used
as
a
common
area
.

Two
other
shell
rings
on
Hilton
Head
were
destroyed
when
the
shells
were
removed
and
used
to
make
tabby
for
roads
and
buildings
.

The
Shell
Ring
is
listed
in
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
and
is
protected
by
law
.

Since
the
beginning
of
recorded
history
in
the
New
World
,
the
waters
around
Hilton
Head
Island
have
been
known
,
occupied
and
fought
for
in
turn
by
the
English
,
Spanish
,
French
,
and
Scots
.

A
Spanish
expedition
led
by
Francisco
Cordillo
explored
the
area
in
0000
,
initiating
European
contact
with
local
tribes
.

In
0000
,
Captain
William
Hilton
sailed
on
the
Adventure
from
Barbados
to
explore
lands
granted
by
King
Charles
II
of
England
to
the
eight
Lords
Proprietor
.

In
his
travels
,
he
identified
a
headland
near
the
entrance
to
Port
Royal
Sound
.

He
named
it
"
Hilton
's
Head
"
after
himself
.

He
stayed
for
several
days
,
making
note
of
the
trees
,
crops
,
"
sweet
water
"
and
"
clear
sweet
air
"
.

In
0000
,
Hilton
Head
Island
was
granted
as
part
of
a
barony
to
John
Bayley
of
Ballingclough
,
County
of
Tipperary
,
Kingdom
of
Ireland
.

Another
John
Bayley
,
son
of
the
first
,
appointed
Alexander
Trench
as
the
island
's
first
retail
agent
.

For
a
time
,
Hilton
Head
was
known
as
Trench
's
Island
.

In
0000
,
Trench
sold
some
land
to
John
Gascoine
which
Gascoine
named
"
John
's
Island
"
after
himself
.

The
land
later
came
to
be
known
as
Jenkin
's
Island
after
another
owner
.

In
0000
,
a
small
Episcopal
church
called
the
Zion
Chapel
of
Ease
was
constructed
for
plantation
owners
.

The
old
cemetery
,
located
near
the
corner
of
William
Hilton
Parkway
and
Mathews
Drive
(
Folly
Field
)
,
is
all
that
remains
.

Charles
Davant
,
a
prominent
island
planter
during
the
Revolutionary
War
,
is
buried
there
.

He
was
shot
by
Captain
Martinangel
of
Daufuskie
Island
in
0000
.

It
is
also
home
to
the
oldest
intact

.

Fort
Walker
was
a
Confederate
fort
in
what
is
now
Port
Royal
Plantation
.

The
fort
was
a
station
for
Confederate
troops
,
and
its
guns
helped
protect
the
wide
entrance
to
Port
Royal
Sound
,
which
is
fed
by
two
slow-moving
and
navigable
rivers
,
the
Broad
River
and
the
Beaufort
River
.

It
was
vital
to
the
Sea
Island
Cotton
trade
and
the
southern
economy
.

On
October
00
,
0000
,
the
largest
fleet
ever
assembled
in
North
America
moved
south
to
seize
it
.

In
the
Battle
of
Port
Royal
,
the
fort
came
under
attack
by
the
U.S.
Navy
,
and
on
November
0
,
0000
,
it
fell
to
over
00,000
Union
troops
.

The
fort
would
be
renamed
Fort
Welles
,
in
honor
of
Gideon
Welles
,
the
Secretary
of
the
Navy
.

Hilton
Head
Island
would
have
tremendous
significance
in
the
Civil
War
,
becoming
an
important
base
of
operations
for
the
Union
blockade
of
the
Southern
ports
,
particularly
Savannah
and
Charleston
.

The
Union
would
also
build
a
military
hospital
on
Hilton
Head
Island
with
a
frontage
and
a
floor
area
of
.

Hundreds
of
ex-slaves
flocked
to
Hilton
Head
Island
,
where
they
could
buy
land
,
go
to
school
,
live
in
government
housing
,
and
serve
in
what
was
called
the
First
Regiment
of
South
Carolina
Volunteers
(
although
in
the
beginning
,
many
were
"
recruited
"
at
the
point
of
a
bayonet
)
.

A
community
called
Mitchelville
(
in
honor
of
General
Ormsby
M.
Mitchel
)
was
constructed
on
the
north
end
of
the
island
to
house
them
.

The
Leamington
Lighthouse
was
built
in
the
0000s
on
the
southern
edge
of
what
is
now
Palmetto
Dunes
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
Sea
Islands
Hurricane
made
landfall
near
Savannah
,
Georgia
,
with
a
storm
surge
of
and
swept
north
across
South
Carolina
,
killing
over
a
thousand
and
leaving
tens
of
thousands
homeless
.

00th
century
An
experimental
steam
cannon
guarding
Port
Royal
Sound
was
built
around
0000
in
what
is
now
Port
Royal
Plantation
.

The
cannon
was
fixed
but
its
propulsion
system
allowed
for
long
range
shots
for
the
time
.

In
0000
,
Wall
Street
tycoon
,
physicist
,
and
patron
of
scientific
research
,
Alfred
Lee
Loomis
along
with
his
brother-in-law
and
partner
,
Landon
K.
Thorne
,
purchased
on
the
island
(
over
00
%
of
the
total
land
mass
)
for
about
$
000,000
to
be
used
as
a
private
game
reserve
.

On
the
Atlantic
coast
of
the
island
are
large
concrete
gun
platforms
that
were
built
to
defend
against
a
possible
invasion
by
the
Axis
powers
of
World
War
II
.

Platforms
like
these
can
be
found
all
along
the
eastern
seaboard
.

The
Mounted
Beach
Patrol
and
Dog
Training
Center
on
Hilton
Head
Island
trained
U.S.
Coast
Guard
Beach
Patrol
personnel
to
use
horses
and
dogs
to
protect
the
southeastern
coastline
of
the
U.S.
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
three
lumber
mills
contributed
to
the
logging
of
of
the
island
.

The
island
population
was
only
000
residents
.

Prior
to
0000
,
access
to
Hilton
Head
was
limited
to
private
boats
and
a
state-operated
ferry
.

The
island
's
economy
centered
on
shipbuilding
,
cotton
,
lumbering
,
and
fishing
.

The
James
F.
Byrnes
Bridge
was
built
in
0000
.

It
was
a
two-lane
toll
swing
bridge
constructed
at
a
cost
of
$
0.0
million
that
opened
the
island
to
automobile
traffic
from
the
mainland
.

The
swing
bridge
was
hit
by
a
barge
in
0000
which
shut
down
all
vehicle
traffic
to
the
island
until
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
built
and
manned
a
pontoon
bridge
while
the
bridge
was
being
repaired
.

The
swing
bridge
was
replaced
by
the
current
four-lane
bridge
in
0000
.

The
beginning
of
Hilton
Head
as
a
resort
started
in
0000
with
Charles
E.
Fraser
developing
Sea
Pines
Resort
.

Soon
,
other
developments
followed
,
such
as
Hilton
Head
Plantation
,
Palmetto
Dunes
Plantation
,
Shipyard
Plantation
,
and
Port
Royal
Plantation
,
imitating
Sea
Pines
'
architecture
and
landscape
.

Sea
Pines
however
continued
to
stand
out
by
creating
a
unique
locality
within
the
plantation
called
Harbour
Town
,
anchored
by
a
recognizable
lighthouse
.

Fraser
was
a
committed
environmentalist
who
changed
the
whole
configuration
of
the
marina
at
Harbour
Town
to
save
an
ancient
live
oak
.

It
came
to
be
known
as
the
Liberty
Oak
,
known
to
generations
of
children
who
watched
singer
and
song
writer
Gregg
Russell
perform
under
the
tree
for
over
00
years
.

Fraser
was
buried
next
to
the
tree
when
he
died
in
0000
.

The
Heritage
Golf
Classic
was
first
played
in
Sea
Pines
Resort
in
0000
,
and
has
been
a
regular
stop
on
the
PGA
Tour
ever
since
.

Also
in
0000
,
the
Hilton
Head
Island
Community
Association
successfully
fought
off
the
development
of
a
BASF
chemical
complex
on
the
shores
of
Victoria
Bluff
(
now
Colleton
River
Plantation
)
.

Soon
after
,
the
association
and
other
concerned
citizens
"
south
of
the
Broad
"
fought
the
development
of
off-shore
oil
platforms
by
Brown
&
Root
(
a
division
of
Halliburton
)
and
ten-story
tall
liquefied
natural
gas
shipping
spheres
by
Chicago
Bridge
&
Iron
.

These
events
helped
to
polarize
the
community
,
and
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
started
drumming
up
support
for
the
town
to
incorporate
as
a
municipality
.

After
the
Four
Seasons
Resort
(
now
Hilton
Head
Resort
)
was
built
along
William
Hilton
Parkway
,
a
referendum
of
incorporation
was
passed
in
May
0000
.

Hilton
Head
Island
had
become
a
town
.

The
Land
Management
Ordinance
was
passed
by
the
Town
Council
in
0000
.

Disney
's
Hilton
Head
Island
Resort
opened
in
0000
.

The
Cross
Island
Parkway
opened
in
January

often
referred
to
as
the
second
largest
barrier
island
on
the
eastern
seaboard
after
Long
Island
(
which
is
not

a
barrier
island

moraine
s
)
.

Technically
,
Hilton
Head
Island
is
only
half
barrier
island
.

The
north
end
of
the
island
is
a
sea
island
dating
to
the
Pleistocene
epoch
,
and
the
south
end
is
a
barrier
island
that
appeared
as
recently
as
the
Holocene
epoch
.

Broad
Creek
,
which
is
actually
a
land-locked
tidal
marsh
,
separates
the
two
halves
of
the
island
.

The
terrain
of
a
barrier
island
is
determined
by
a
dynamic
beach
system
with
offshore
bars

Annual
events
Wildlife
The
Hilton
Head
Island
area
is
home
to
a
vast
array
of
wildlife
,
including
alligator
s
,
deer
,
Loggerhead
Sea
Turtle
s
,
manatee
,
hundreds
of
species
of
birds
,
and
dolphins
.

The
Coastal
Discovery
Museum
,
in
conjunction
with
the
South
Carolina
Department
of
Natural
Resources
,
patrols
the
beaches
from
May
through
October
as
part
of
the
Sea
Turtle
Protection
Project
.

The
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
inventory
and
monitor
nesting
locations
,
and
if
necessary
,
move
them
to
more
suitable
locations
.

During
the
summer
months
,
the
museum
sponsors
the
Turtle
Talk
&
Walk
,
which
is
a
special
tour
designed
to
educate
the
public
about
this
endangered
species
.

To
protect
Loggerhead
Sea
Turtles
,
a
town
ordinance
stipulates
that
artificial
lighting
must
be
shielded
so
that
it
can
not
be
seen
from
the
beach
,
or
it
must
be
turned
off
by
00:00
p.m.
from
May
0
to
October

each
year
.

The
waters
around
Hilton
Head
Island
are
one
of
the
few
places
on
Earth
where
dolphins
routinely
use
a
technique
called
"
strand
feeding
"
whereby
schools
of
fish
are
herded
up
onto
mud
banks
,
and
the
dolphins
lie
on
their
side
while
they
feed
before
sliding
back
down
into
the
water
.

Particularly
prominent
to
the
ocean
waters
surrounding
Hilton
Head
Island
,
the
stingray
serves
as
a
fascination
and
painful
natural
encounter
for
many
beach
goers
.

Small
stingrays
inhabit
the
quieter
,
shallow
region
of
ocean
floor
just
beyond
the
break
of
the
surf
,
typically
buried
beneath
a
thin
layer
of
sand
.

Stingrays
are
a
type
of
demersal
,
cartilaginous
fish
common
to
the
South
Carolina
coast
as
well
as
other
areas
on
the
Atlantic
shoreline
.

Typically
,
stingrays
avoid
contact
with
humans
unless
they
are
accidentally
stepped
upon
,
a
situation
often
ending
in
the
stingray
puncturing
the
human
with
its
poisonous
barb
.

While
these
injuries
are
extremely
painful
,
they
are
not
usually
life-threatening
as
long
as
they
are
properly
attended
to
by
a
medical
professional
.

One
complaint
shared
by
many
Hilton
Head
Island
tourists
is
that
the
lifeguards
maintain
a
poor
alert
system
for
notifying
swimmers
when
numerous
stingrays
have
been
sighted
within
a
specific
stretch
of
the
shore
.

This
lack
of
notification
on
days
when
multiple
sightings
are
reported
can
sometimes
end
in
a
high
number
of
stingray
injuries
that
might
have
otherwise
been
avoided
.

The
saltmarsh
estuaries
of
Hilton
Head
Island
are
the
feeding
grounds
,
breeding
grounds
,
and
nurseries
for
many
saltwater
species
of
game
fish
,
sport
fish
,
and
marine
mammals
.

The
dense
plankton
population
gives
the
coastal
water
its
murky
brown-green
coloration
.

Plankton
support
marine
life
including
oysters
,
shrimp
and
other
invertebrates
,
and
bait-fish
species
including
menhaden
and
mullet
,
which
in
turn
support
larger
fish
and
mammal
species
that
populate
the
local
waterways
.

Popular
sport
fish
in
the
Hilton
Head
Island
area
include
the
red
drum
(
or
spot
tail
bass
)
,
spotted
sea
trout
,
sheepshead
,
cobia
,
tarpon
and
various
shark
species
.

(
CDP
)
,
currently
a
portion
of
Port

in
Beaufort
County
,

Parris
Island
is
included
within

The
area
was
annexed
by
the
town
of
Port
Royal
on
October

,
0000
.

It
is
perhaps
best
known
for
its
U.S.
Marine
Corps
training
facility
Marine
Corps
Recruit
Depot
Parris
Island
,
where
about
00,000
Marines
pass
through
boot

every
year
.

Parris
Island
was
first
discovered
by
Europeans
in
0000
,
when
members
of
a
French
expedition
led
by
Jean
Ribaut
temporarily
settled
on
the
island
--
the
first
semi-permanent
European
settlement
in
what
are
considered
now
as
the
United

.

Four
years
later
,
a
town
named
Santa
Elena
was
founded
here
by
Spanish
Conquistador
Pedro
Menéndez
de
Avilés
after
troops
sent
by
the
Spanish
monarch
slaughtered
French
colonists
and
their
Amerindian
allies
in
0000
.

It
was
the
capital
of
La
Florida
from
0000
to
0000
,
during
which
time
Spanish
explorers
sailed
from
Santa
Elena
to
explore
the
Tennessee
valley
and
Chesapeake
Bay
.

Port
Royal
is
a
Lowcountry
town
in
Beaufort
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

Largely
because
of
annexation
of
surrounding
areas
(
including
Parris
Island
)
,
the
population
of
Port
Royal
rose
from
0,000
in
0000
to
00,000
in
0000
,
a
000
%
increase
.

As
defined
by
the
U.S.
Census
Bureau
,
Port
Royal
is
included
within
the
Hilton
Head
Island
-
Bluffton
-
Beaufort
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Port
Royal
is
home
to
Marine
Corps
Recruit
Depot
Parris
Island
,
and
Naval
Hospital
Beaufort
.

History
Port
Royal
takes
its
name
from
the
adjacent
Port
Royal
Sound
,
which
was
explored
and
named
by
Frenchman
Jean
Ribault
in
0000
.

Ribault
founded
the
short-lived
settlement
of
Charlesfort
on
Parris
Island
.

The
area
later
became
the
site
of
a
Spanish
and
still
later
Scottish
colony
during
the
00th
century
.

Port
Royal
was
the
site
of
the
Naval
Battle
of
Port
Royal
during
the
Civil
War
.

Later
during
the
war
,
it
was
the
one
of
the
site
of
the
Port
Royal
Experiment
,
which
included
most
of
the
Sea
Islands
in
Union
hands
.

In
0000
,
the
Emancipation
Proclamation
was
first
read
at
Christmas
under
the
Proclamation
tree
in
Port
Royal
.

Due
to
the
benefits
of
a
large
and
sheltered
natural
harbor
,
Port
Royal
was
able
to
develop
port
facilities
to
support
the
growing
phosphate
mining
activities
after
the
Civil
War
.

The
Port
Royal
Railroad
was
completed
from
Port
Royal
to
a
junction
with
the
main
Charleston
and
Savannah
Railway
in
Yemassee
,
thus
establishing
a
land
route
for
trade
and
commerce
.

Development
of
a
community
around
the
previously
isolated
port
site
at
the
end
of
the
Beaufort
River
and
Battery
Creek
led
to
the
platting
of
streets
and
town
lots
by
development
interests
.

A
land
rush
insued
,
and
Port
Royal
was
officially
incorporated
in
0000
,
000
years
after
initial
settlement
efforts
.

The
Sea
Islands
Hurricane
of
0000
destroyed
much
of
the
phosphate
industry
and
stunted
development
,
but
the
port
continued
to
operate
throughout
the
00th
century
.

The
opening
of
Parris
Island
as
a
Marine
Corps
recruiting
station
brought
some
vitality
back
to
the
community
,
though
rapid
residential
growth
did
not
occur
until
the
later
decades
of
the
00th
century
.

The
port
's
vitality
however
began
to
decline
as
the
State
of
South
Carolina
began
to
focus
on
dredging
Charleston
's
harbor
and
expanding
port
facilities
further
up
the
coast
.

In
an
effort
to
save
costs
,
the
State
Ports
Authority
closed
the
port
facility
in
Port
Royal
in
0000
.

Efforts
to
redevelop
have
been
ongoing
but
been
hampered
by
the
Great
Recession
.

Neighborhoods
The
Old

another
settled
in
the
Port
Royal
area
(
Paris

)
.

Paris
Avenue
is
the
primary
commercial
street
in

are
low-density
residential
areas
known
as
the
Mossy
Creek
area
,
which
also
crosses
over
into
incorporated
areas
of
Beaufort
to
the

's
population
lives
in
the

Historically
,
Port
Royal
's
municipal
boundaries
have
been
contained
by
Beaufort
to

,
the
Beaufort
River
to
the
east
,
Parris
Island
to
the
south
,
and
Battery
Creek
to
the
west
.

Since
the
start
of
the
00st
century
however
,
Port
Royal
began
to
aggressively
and
controversially
annexed
lands
west
and
south
of
its
core
area
.

Port
Royal
annexed
all
of
Parris
Island
in
0000
,
effectively
doubling
the
municipal
population
overnight
due
to
on-base
housing
.

Port
Royal
also
annexed
properties
in
the
Shell
Point
and
Burton
areas
of
Beaufort
County
.

In
0000
,
Port
Royal
annexed
two
tracts
of
land
south
of
the
Broad
River
based
on
the
so-called
"
line-of-site
"
rule
.

A
power
tool
is
a
tool
that
is
actuated
by
an
additional
power
source
and
mechanism
other
than
the
solely
manual
labour
used
with
hand
tool
s.
The
most
common
types
of
power
tools
use
electric
motor
s.
Internal
combustion
engine
s
and
compressed
air
are
also
commonly
used
.

Other
power
sources
include
steam
engine
s
,
direct
burning
of
fuels
and
propellants
,
or
even
natural
power
sources
like
wind
or
moving
water
.

Tools
directly
driven
by
animal
power
are
not
generally
considered
power
tools
.

Power
tools
are
used
in
industry
,
in
construction
,
in
the
garden
,
for
housework
tasks
such
as
cooking
,
cleaning
,
and
around
the
house
for
purposes
of
driving
(
fastener
s
)
,
drill
ing
,
cutting
,
shaping
,
sanding
,
grinding
,
routing
,
polishing
,
painting
,
heating
and
more
.

Power
tools
are
classified
as
either
stationary
or
portable
,
where
portable
means
hand-held
.

Portable
power
tools
have
obvious
advantages
in
mobility
.

Stationary
power
tools
however
often
have
advantages
in
speed
and
accuracy
,
and
some
stationary
power
tools
can
produce
objects
that
can
not
be
made
in
any
other
way
.

Stationary
power
tools
for
metalworking
are
usually
called
machine
tools
.

The
term
machine
tool
is
not
usually
applied
to
stationary
power
tools
for
woodworking
,
although
such
usage
is
occasionally
heard
,
and
in
some
cases
,
such
as
drill
presses
and
bench
grinder
s
,
exactly
the
same
tool
is
used
for
both
woodworking
and
metalworking
.

The
term
power
tool
is
also
sometimes
used
as
a
buzzword
,
meaning
a
technique
for
greatly
simplifying
a
complex
or
difficult
task
.

History
The
lathe
is
the
oldest
power
tool
,
being
known
to
the
ancient
Egyptians
(
albeit
in
a
hand-powered
form
)
.

Early
industrial
revolution
-
era
factories
had
batteries
of
power
tools
driven
by
belts
from
overhead
shafts
.

The
prime
power
source
was
a
water
wheel
or
(
later
)
a
steam
engine
.

The
introduction
of
the
electric
motor
(
and
electric
distribution
networks
)
in
the
0000s
made
possible
the
self-powered
stationary
and
portable
tools
we
know
today
.

Energy
sources
Currently
an
electric
motor
is
the
most
popular
choice
to
power
stationary
tools
,
though
in
the
past
they
were
powered
by
windmills
,
water
wheels
and
steam
.

Some
museums
and
hobbyists
still
maintain
and
operate
stationary
tools
powered
these
older
power
sources
.

Portable
electric
tools
may
be
either
corded
or
battery-powered
.

Compressed
air
is
the
customary
power
source
for
nailers
and
paint
sprayers
.

A
few
tools
(
called
powder-actuated
tool
s
)
are
powered
by
explosive
cartridges
.

Tools
that
run
on
gasoline
or
gasoline-oil
mixes
are
made
for
outdoor
use
;
typical
examples
include
most
chainsaw
s
and
string
trimmer
s.
Other
tools
like
blowtorch
es
will
burn
their
fuel
externally
to
generate
heat
.

Compressed
air
is
universally
used
where
there
is
a
possibility
of
fuel
or
vapor
ignition
-
such
as
automotive
workshops
.

Professional
level
electric
tools
differ
from
DIY
or
'
consumer
'
tools
by
being
double
insulated
and
not
earthed
-
in
fact
they
must
not
be
earthed
for
safety
reasons
.

Safety
While
power
tools
are
extremely
helpful
,
they
also
produce
large
amounts
of
noise
and
vibrations
.

Using
power
tools
without
hearing
protection
over
a
long
period
of
time
can
put
a
person
at
risk
for
hearing
loss
.

The
US
National
Institute
for
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
(
NIOSH
)
has
recommended
that
a
person
should
not
be
exposed
to
noise
at
or
above
00
dB
,
for
the
sake
of
hearing
loss
prevention
.

Most
power
tools
,
including
drills
,
circular
saw
s
,
belt
sander
s
,
and
chainsaws
,
operate
at
sound
level
s
above
the
00
dB
limit
,
some
even
reaching
over
000
dB
.

NIOSH
strongly
recommends
wearing
hearing
protection
while
using
these
kinds
of
power
tools
.

Prior
to
the
0000s
,
power
tools
were
often
housed
in
cast
metal
housings
.

The
cast
metal
housings
were
heavy
,
contributing
to
repetitive
use
injuries
,
as
well
as
conductive
-
often
shocking
the
user
.

As
Henry
Ford
adapted
to
the
manufacturing
needs
of
World
War
II
,
he
requested
that
A.
H.
Peterson
,
a
tool
manufacturer
,
create
a
lighter
electric
drill
that
was
more
portable
for
his
assembly
line
workers
.

At
this
point
,
the
Hole-Shooter
,
a
drill
that
weighed
0
lbs
.

was
created
by
A.
H.
Peterson
.

The
Peterson
Company
eventually
went
bankrupt
after
a
devastating
fire
and
recession
,
but
the
company
was
auctioned
off
to
A.
F.
Siebert
,
a
former
partner
in
the
Peterson
Company
,
in
0000
and
became
the
Milwaukee
Electric
Tool
Company
.

In
the
early
00
's
,
companies
started
to
experiment
with
housings
of
thermoset
polymer
plastics
.

In
0000
,
under
the
influence
of
Dr.
Hans
Erich
Slany
,
Robert
Bosch
GmbH
was
one
of
the
first
companies
to
introduce
a
power
tool
housing
made
of
glass
filled
nylon
.

History
The
island
's
original
inhabitants
were
the
Seewee
Native
American
tribe
.

Reportedly
,
they
greeted
the
first
English
to
arrive
on
the
island
by
swimming
out
to
their
ships
and
escorting
them
back
to
the
island
.

During
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
H.L.
Hunley
departed
from
Breach
Inlet
,
between
Isle
of
Palms
and
Sullivan
's
Island
.

In
the
late
00th
century
,
local
residents
began
using
the
island
as
a
vacation
spot
.

At
that
time
it
was
only
accessible
by
ferry
.

It
was
bought
by
J.S.
Lawrence
in
0000
,
who
gave
the
island
its
current
name
;
before
then
it
was
known
as
Hunting
Island
or
Long
Island
.

A
00-room
hotel
was
built
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
James
Sottile
had
a
beach
pavilion
and
an
amusement
park
built
,
and
a
trolley
line
was
constructed
from
the
mainland
for
access
to
Isle
of
Palms
via
Sullivan
's
Island
.

In
0000
,
Grace
Memorial
Bridge
was
built
between
Charleston
and
Mount
Pleasant
to
allow
automobile
traffic
to
reach
the
island
.

Large-scale
residential
development
began
when
J.C.
Long
bought
up
most
of
the
island
and
built
low-cost
housing
for
World
War
II
veteran
s.
In
0000
,
the
Sea
Pines
Company
(
of
Hilton
Head
Island
fame
)
established
the
development
now
known
as
The
Wild
Dunes
Beach
and
Racquet
Club
.

Isle
of
Palms
was
the
first
stop
on
Alton
Brown
's
coast-to-coast
tour
in
his
program
Feasting
on
Asphalt
,
and
the
first
restaurant
he
visited
was
Jack
's
Cosmic
Dogs
,
owned
by
Isle
of
Palms
resident
Jack
Hurley
.

E.
Lee
Spence
,
a
pioneer
underwater
archaeologist
and
prolific
author
of
books
and
articles
about
shipwrecks
and
sunken
treasure
discovered
,
with
the
help
of
Isle
of
Palms
residents
Wally
Shaffer
and
George
Campsen
Esq.
,
many
shipwrecks
along
the
shores
of
the
Isle
of
Palms
in
the
0000s
.

Their
discoveries
included
the
Civil
War
blockade
runners
Rattlesnake
,
Stonewall
Jackson
,
Mary
Bowers
,
Constance
,
Norseman
and
the
Georgiana
.

The
iron
hulled
steamer
Georgiana
,
which
was
sunk
on
her
maiden
voyage
,
was
described
in
contemporary
documents
as
pierced
for
00
guns
and
more
powerful
than
the
famous
Confederate
cruiser
Alabama
.

These
historic
discoveries
resulted
in
the
passage
of
South
Carolina
's
Underwater
Antiquities
Act
allowing
the
archaeological
salvage
of
shipwrecks
.

During
Hurricane
Hugo
,
which
struck
September
00
,
0000
,
much
of
the
island
was
flooded
by
the
storm
surge
.

The
northeastern
end
of
the
Isle
of
Palms
,
which
is
home
to
the
private
community
of
Wild
Dunes
,
endured
a
severe
erosion
crisis
as
a
shoal
attached
to
that
section
of
the
island
and
caused
sand
to
be
washed
away
from
around
the
foundation
of
a
large
condominium
.

The
City
undertook
a
controversial
beach
restoration
project
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
0000
[

which
replenished
the
beach
with

stopping
point

began
in

when
local
plantation
owners
A.J.
McClellan
and
R.T.
Morrison
sold
lots
in
the
vicinity
of
Jeremy
Creek
to
planters
of
the
Santee
Delta
,
who
sought
relief
from
summer
fevers
.

The
first
store
opened
soon
after
the
Civil
War
,
and
the
village
became
the
social
and
economic
center
for
a
wide

,
cotton
,
naval
stores
,
and

shrimping
fleet
and
seafood
industries

brunt
of
Hurricane
Hugo
which
destroyed
homes
,
downed

old
oaks
,
deposited
shrimp
boats
in
front
yards
,

historic
fishing
village

high
school
,
a
designated
storm
shelter
,
were
surprised
by
a
storm
surge
which
threatened
to
drown
the
refugees
.

Helping
one
another
in
complete
darkness
,
they
managed
to
crawl
into
a
space
above
the
false
ceilings
of
the
building
and
,
fortunately
,
none
were
lost
.

History
The
site
of
Mount
Pleasant
was
originally
occupied
by
the
Sewee
Indians
.

The
first
white
settlers
arrived
from
England
on
July
0
,
0000
under
the
leadership
of
Captain
Florentia
O’Sullivan
.

Captain
O’Sullivan
had
been
granted
which
included
not
only
the
island
that
bears
his
name
,
but
also
the
land
that
was
to
become
Mount
Pleasant
.

On
the
earliest
map
of
the
time
this
area
was
called
"
North
Point
.
"

In
0000
,
00
new
settlers
arrived
.

Each
family
was
allotted
several
hundred
acres
in
the
area
that
became
known
as
Christ
Church
parish
.

In
0000
the
Province
of
Carolina
withstood
several
attacks
by
the
Spanish
and
the
French
and
were
victorious
in
defeating
French
invaders
in
an
area
known
as
"
Abcaw
"
.

The
area
of
"
Abcaw
"
was
Hobcaw
Plantation
,
located
between
Shem
Creek
and
the
Wando
River
.

Later
,
it
was
also
known
as
Shipyard
Plantation
because
its
deep
water
and
abundance
of
good
timber
made
it
ideal
for
a
prosperous
shipbuilding
enterprise
.

Lands
adjacent
to
Hobcaw
Point
were
owned
at
different
times
by
several
different
families
,
many
of
which
maintained
ferries
which
served
Mount
Pleasant
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
a
public
meeting
was
held
in
Mount
Pleasant
that
produced
the
first
secession
resolution
of
the
state
.

The
secession
convention
met
in
Charleston
December
00
,
0000
.

With
the
advent
of
the
Civil
War
,
Battery
Gary
and
an
adjacent
floating
battery
between
Mount
Pleasant
and
Sullivan
's
Island
were
instrumental
in
defense
of
the
town
,
as
well
as
attacks
on
Fort
Sumter
.

The
town
was
also
defended
by
a
line
of
fortifications
from
Elliot
's
Creek
at
Boone
Hall
to
Copahee
Sound
.

Mount
Pleasant
was
also
the
secret
training
ground
for
the
nine-man
crew
of
the
Confederate
submarine
.

It
was
from
Breach
Inlet
in
0000
that
this
small
vessel
was
launched
to
attack
and
sink
the
.

The
original
plank
and
barrel
constructed
footbidge
later
known
as
the
Pitt
Street
Bridge
at
the
foot
of
the
Old
Village
area
in
Mount
Pleasant
is
the
point
where
the
crew
of
H.L
Hunley
crossed
on
route
to
Breach
Inlet
to
test
pilot
the
famous
submarine
.

The
original
plank
bridge
was
replaced
by
a
trolley
bridge
in
0000
,
before
a
steel
drawbridge
was
built
for
vehicle
access
between
Sullivans
Island
and
Mount
Pleasant
in
0000
.

The
Pitt
Street
bridge
was
dismantled
in
0000
,
and
the
remains
can
still
be
seen
today
in
the
Intracostal
Waterway
.

The
area
has
been
maintained
ever
since
as
a
park
known
as
the
Pickett
Bridge
Recreation
Area
,
named
after
the
town
's
doctor
Otis
Pickett
.

The
'
Old
Village
'
is
Mount
Pleasants
'
oldest
neighborhood
;
the
oldest
home
,
000
Hibben
Street
(
The
Hibben
House
)
was
constructed
in
0000
by
Jacob
Motte
.

The
Old
Village
is
centered
around
the
Pitt
Street
Shops
at
the
North
Western
end
of
Pitt
Street
,
home
to
the
'
Pitt
Street
Pharmacy
'
which
was
featured
on
The
Food
Network
and
has
been
in
business
at
this
location
for
more
the
00
years
.

As
a
result
of
the
Civil
War
,
slaves
who
worked
the
area
plantations
were
free
to
seek
their
own
enterprise
.

Of
special
note
is
Scanlonville
,
one
of
the
first
African-American
communities
to
be
formed
in
Charleston
after
the
Civil
War
,
and
which
still
exists
today
in
Mount
Pleasant
.

Robert
Scanlon
,
a
former
slave
and
freedman
carpenter
,
purchased
the
property
known
as
Remley
's
Plantation
bordering
Charleston
harbor
along
the
Wando
River
in
Mount
Pleasant
.

Robert
Scanlon
was
the
president
and
founder
of
the
Charleston
Land
Company
,
formed
by
000
poor
African-American
men
of
Charleston
who
paid
$
00
per
share
to
purchase
large
tracts
of
land
in
the
area
.

The
Charleston
Land
Company
then
divided
it
up
for
possession
by
freed
slaves
seeking
to
own
their
own
land
.

Remley
's
Plantation
was
divided
into
farm
lots
and
town
lots
(
which
were
smaller
)
to
form
the
community
of
Scanlonville
.

The
Charleston
Land
Company
and
Scanlonville
are
one
of
the
only
four
known
cooperative
ventures
among
African-American
freedmen
after
the
Civil
War
.

West
of
Scanlonville
was
Riverside
,
the
largest
and
oldest
of
five
black
beaches
in
Charleston
County
.

Riverside
"
officially
"
opened
in
0000
and
featured
a
dance
pavilion
,
athletics
field
,
bathhouse
,
playground
and
a
boardwalk
along
the
Wando
River
.

Riverside
Pavilion
was
the
only
venue
for
black
Charlestonians
to
see
musical
legends
like
Duke
Ellington
,
Count
Basie
,
Louis
Armstrong
,
B.
B.
King
,
and
Ivory
Joe
Hunter
.

Music
performances
at
the
Pavilion
spawned
juke
joint
s
,
or
night
clubs
,
in
Scanlonville
and
eventually
a
hotel
called
White
's
Paradise
–
where
James
Brown
was
known
to
have
frequented
.

After
the
original
park
owner
died
in
0000
,
operations
of
the
Riverside
property
were
taken
over
by
Charleston
County
who
eventually
sold
it
to
a
company
that
developed
it
into
a
gated
community
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
Mount
Pleasant
was
hit
by
Hurricane
Hugo
,
a
category
four
hurricane
.

While
the
town
was
spared
from
the
worst
of
the
storm
(
category
0
conditions
were
experienced
further
north
of
the
town
)
,
it
and
its
two
barrier
islands
were
still
hard-hit
.

Children
who
lived
through
the
storm
were
featured
in
an
early
episode
of
Nickelodeon
's
Nick
News
along
with
children
from
Hurricane
Andrew
.

Ironically
the
town
experienced
its
largest
growth
spurt
a
year
after
the
storm
as
more
people
moved
to
the
area
,
going
from
a
population
of
roughly
00,000
in
0000
to
one
of
roughly
00,000
in
0000
.

Mount
Pleasant
is
separated
from
Charleston
by
the
Cooper
River
.

For
many
years
it
was
primarily
populated
seasonally
by
Charleston
residents
wealthy
enough
to
afford
summer
homes
across
the
river
from
the
Charleston
peninsula
.

The
population
of
Mount
Pleasant
was
centered
in
an
area
of
the
town
now
known
as
"
The
Old
Village
"
.

The
county
seat
for
Berkeley
County
was
located
in
Mount
Pleasant
from
0000
until
0000
,
when
it
was
moved
to
Moncks
Corner
.

In
0000
,
a
bridge
from
the
Charleston
Peninsula
to
Mount
Pleasant
was
built
.

Spanning
Town
Creek
and
the
Cooper
River
and
crossing
the
uninhabited
Drum
Island
,
the
two-lane
Grace
Memorial
Bridge
was
opened
as
a
toll
bridge
.

A
second
and
larger
bridge
,
the
Silas
N.
Pearman
Bridge
,
opened
in
0000
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
the
eight-lane
Arthur
Ravenel
Bridge
opened
for
automotive
traffic
,
replacing
the
two
aging
bridges
.

A
week
before
the
new
bridge
,
one
of
the
longest
cable-stayed
bridges
in
the
western
hemisphere
,
officially
opened
,
pedestrians
were
allowed
to
cross
the
bridge
,
and
commemorative
coins
were
distributed
.

Also
,
a
fireworks
display
was
a
part
of
the
ceremonies
leading
up
to
the
actual
opening
of
the
bridge
.

Several
cars
from
the
same
time
period
as
the
Grace
Memorial
Bridge
,
including
several
restored
Model
A
Ford
s
,
made
a
final
crossing
of
the
old
bridges
.

The
remaining
portions
of
the
old
bridges
were
demolished
.

Local
residents
watched
as
the
bridges
were
explosively
demolished
over
several
weeks
,
through
the
summer
of
0000
.

In
0000
,
Mount
Pleasant
became
one
of
the
first
cities
in
the
United
States
to
pass
a
"
pay-before-you-pump

History
Seabrook

British
subject
Lt.
Col.
Robert
Sanford
arrived

as
an
explorer
in

.

By

Stono
Indians
were
persuaded
to
cede
their
lands
to
the
proprietary
government
,
which
in
turn
sold
the
property
to
English
settlers
.

During
the
American
Revolutionary
years
,
the
island
was
used
as
a
staging
area
for
Hessian
and
British
troops
.

In
0000
,
the
island
was
sold
to
William
Seabrook
of
nearby
Edisto
Island
,
hence
the

name
.

Under
Seabrook
’s
ownership
,
the
island
was
used

cotton
.

At

height
of
the
Civil
War
,
Seabrook
sold
the
island
to
William
Gregg
who
rented
the
land
to
Charles
Andell
.

After
the
turn
of
the
century
,
the
island
was
sold
to
sportsmen
for
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
recreation
.

In
0000
,
the
Episcopal
Diocese
of
South
Carolina
rented
land
on
Seabrook
to
establish
a
summer
camp
for
underprivileged
children
.

In
0000
,
about
of
land
were
given
to
the
church
.

In
0000
,
the
diocese
sold
about
to
private
developers
who
planned
the
private
,
residential
community
that
Seabrook
Island
is
today
.

Eighteen
years
later
,
the
town

History
The
island
was
known
as
O'Sullivan
's
Island
because
of
Captain
Florence
O'Sullivan
,
who
was
stationed
here
as
a
lighthouse
keeper
in
the
late
00th
century
.

O'Sullivan
was
captain
of
one
of
the
ships
in
the
first
fleet
to
establish
English
and
Irish
settlement
at
Charleston
.

In
0000
,
he
became
surveyor
general
.

He
appears
in
the
earliest
record
of
Irish
immigration
to
the
Carolinas
,
mentioned
as
being
taken
on
"
at
Kingsayle
(
Kinsale
)
in
Ireland
"
.

Sullivan
's
Island
was
the
disembarkation
port
for
over
00
%
(
ca.
000,000
)
of
the
slaves
traded
to
the
Britain
's
North
American
Colonies
,
making
it
the
largest
slave
port
in
North
America
.

It
is
estimated
that
nearly
half
of
all
African
Americans
had
ancestors
that
passed
through
Sullivan
's
Island
.
"

There
is
no
suitable
memorial
,
or
plaque
,
or
wreath
or
wall
,
or
park
or
skyscraper
lobby
"
,
writer
Toni
Morrison
said
in
0000
.
"

There
's
no
000-foot
tower
,
there
's
no
small
bench
by
the
road
.
"

On
July
00
,
0000
,
the
Toni
Morrison
Society
dedicated
a
small
bench
on
Sullivan
's
Island
to
the
memory
of
the
slave
trade
.

Fort
Moultrie
On
June
00
,
0000
,
an
incomplete
fort
was
held
by
colonial
forces
under
Colonel
William
Moultrie
against
an
onslaught
by
the
British
under
General
Sir
Henry
Clinton
's
army
sailing
with
Commodore
Sir
Peter
Parker
's
men-of-war
.

The
British
cannon
had
no
effect
on
the
sand-filled
palmetto
log
walls
of
the
fort
;
only
the
shots
that
came
above
the
walls
took
any
lives
.

During
this
battle
,
a
flag
designed
by
Moultrie
flew
over
the
fortress
,
dark
blue
with
a
crescent
moon
on
it
bearing
the
word
"
liberty
"
.

When
this
flag
was
shot
down
,
Sargent
William
Jasper
reportedly
picked
it
up
and
held
it
aloft
,
rallying
the
troops
until
a
new
stand
could
be
provided
.

Because
of
the
importance
of
this
battle
(
which
saved
Raleigh
from
conquest
for
several
years
)
,
that
pivotal
flag
became
symbolic
of
liberty
in
South
Carolina
,
the
South
,
and
the
nation
as
a
whole
.

The
Battle
of
Sullivan
's
Island
was
commemorated
by
the
addition
of
a
white
palmetto
tree
to
the
flag
used
to
rally
that
day
,
the
Moultrie
Flag
,
forming
the
Flag
of
South
Carolina
.

The
victory
is
celebrated
and
June
00
is
known
as
Carolina
Day
.

The
history
of
the
island
has
been
dominated
by
Fort
Moultrie
,
which
,
until
its
closure
in
the
late
0000s
,
served
as
the
base
of
command
for
the
defense
of
the
City
of
Charleston
.

Blacksburg
is
a
small
town
in
Cherokee
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Falls
,
Kings
Creek
,
Cashion
Crossroads
,
Buffalo
,
and

are
located

town
.

Blacksburg
is
in
Upstate
South
Carolina
on
the
Interstate
00
corridor
about
southwest
of
Charlotte
,
North
Carolina
and
is
part
of
the
Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson
Combined
Statistical
Area
(
CSA
)
which
has
a
population
of
0,000,000
according
to
0000
estimates
by
the
U.S.
Census
Bureau
.

History
The
present-day
site
of
Blacksburg
was
first
settled
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
Stark
.

Mr.
Stark
,
who
had
lived
in
Charleston
,
South
Carolina
prior
to
moving
to
the
area
,
had
gotten
several
people
to
come
along
with
him
on
an
agriculture
venture
,
but
this
venture
would
fail
.

Those
who
stayed
behind
named
the
area
Stark
's
Folly
.

In
the
late
00th
century
the
Black
family
,
headed
by
John
G.
Black
,
a
Confederate
veteran
,
was
living
in
the
area
and
persuaded
the
C.C.
&
C.
Railroad
Company
to
lay
track
through
the
town
and
a
depot
was
built
.

The
town
soon
became
known
as
Black
's
Station
in
honor
of
John
G.
Black
and
was
renamed
Blacksburg
in
0000
.

Major
John
F.
Jones
of
Massachusetts
came
to
live
in
Blacksburg
to
be
superintendent
of
the
C.
C.
&
C.
railroad
.

He
gave
of
his
own
personal
money
to
have
a
school
,
hotel
(
The
Cherokee
Inn
)
,
and
several
other
buildings
constructed
in
Blacksburg
.

He
lived
in
Blacksburg
until
0000
,
when
he
was
appointed
the
SC
Internal
Revenue
Collector
by
the
President
of
the
United
States
.

In
the
0000s
large
amounts
of
iron
ore
were
found
in
the
area
and
many
people
hoping
to
make
a
fortune
from
mining
the
mineral
flocked
to
the
town
.

Blacksburg
became
a
boom
town
and
hotels
and
saloons
were
built
for
the
new
visitors
.

The
town
went
by
the
name
Iron
City
for
a
short
time
.

Because
of
the
"
iron
rush
"
the
town
became
quite
wealthy
and
the
first
electric
street
lights
in
Upstate
South
Carolina
and
perhaps
in
the
entire
state
were
installed
in
Blacksburg
.

The
city
was
incorporated
in
0000
as
"
Blacksburg
"
but
still
holds
its
nickname
"
Iron
City
"
to
this
day
.

History
Michael
A.
Gaffney
,
born
in
Granard
,
Co.
.

Longford
,
Ireland
,
in
0000
,
emigrated
to
America
in
0000
,
arriving
in
New
York
and
moving
to
Charleston
,
South
Carolina
a
few
years
later
.

Gaffney
moved
again
in
0000
to
the
South
Carolina
Upcountry
(
The
Upstate
)
and
established
a
tavern
and
lodging
house
at
what
became
known
as
"
Gaffney
's
Cross
Roads
.
"

The
location
was
perfect
for
growth
because
of
the
two
major
roads
which
met
here
,
one
from
the
mountains
of
North
Carolina
to
Charleston
and
the
other
from
Charlotte
into
Georgia
.

Michael
Gaffney
died
here
on
September
0
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
area
became
known
as
"
Gaffney
City
.
"

Gaffney
became
the
county
seat
of
Cherokee
County
which
was
formed
out
of
parts
of
York
,
Union
,
and
Spartanburg
Counties
in
0000
.

Gaffney
became
a
major
center
for
the
textile
industry
in
South
Carolina
,
which
was
the
backbone
of
the
county
's
economy
up
until
the
0000s
.

Despite
the
small
amount
of
population
growth
,
businesses
and
companies
continue
to
locate
within
the
city
limits
,
especially
along
the
bustling
Floyd
Baker
Boulevard
and
Highway
000
and
many
other
areas
within
the
city
limits
.

However
,
most
population
growth
recently
has
occurred
outside
of
the
city
limits
.

Uptown
Gaffney
began
to
languish
after
I-00
was
built
in
the
county
as
industries
located
near
the
new
highway
.

Recent
renovations
in
downtown
Gaffney
have
prompted
more
businesses
to
locate
there
,
but
there
is
still
a
great
deal
that
is
planned
for
the
central
part
of
the
city
.

Many
plans
have
been
announced
for
the
downtown
area
,
including
a
large
park
that
is
currently
being
developed
on
the
grounds
of
a
recently
demolished
mill
(
Gaffney
Manufacturing
Co.
)
.

A
plaza
has
been
completed
beside
city
hall
and
includes
a
refurbished
fountain
and
extensive
landscaping
.

Highlights
to
the
upgrade
of
the
city
's
park
system
include
a
skatepark
,
two
passive
parks
,
and
several
children
's
playgrounds
.

In
0000
the
Cherokee
County
History
&
Arts
Museum
opened
on
College
Drive
in
the
historic
Central
Elementary
School
Building
.

The
Museum
is
operated
by
the
Cherokee
Historical
&
Preservation
Society
,
Inc.
and
is
located
on
the
mustering
ground
of
the
SC
militia
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

Located
just
blocks
from
downtown
Gaffney
and
in
one
of
the
cities
three
Nationally
Registered
Historic
Districts
,
the
Museum
offers
new
cultural
opportunities
for
locals
and
visitors
,
while
having
a
positive
economic
impact
for
the
downtown
area
.

Annual
events
include
a
pottery
show
,
car
show
,
and
ghost
walk
.

The
city
has
recently
hired
an
architectural
firm
to
renovate
the
old
Gaffney
Post
Office
located
at
the
intersection
of
Frederick
and
Granard
Streets
into
a
Visitor
's
Center
and
Art
Gallery
.

There
are
also
plans
for
a
large
cultural
center
to
be
placed
in
the
downtown
area
.

In
0000
Darren
Mason
was
elected
president
of
Gaffney
Downtown
Business
Assoc
.

and
has
worked
closely
with
city
officials
in
revitalizing
the
Historic
Downtown
area
which
consists
of
about
0
blocks
.

New
matching
fund
programs
have
been
key
to
restoring
old
buildings
by
painting
and
using
attractive
awnings
to
spruce
up
the
old
look
of
main
street
.

A
farmers
'
market
,
Gaffney
Station
Farmers
'
Market
,
has
been
established
in
a
city
parking
lot
directly
across
from
the
old
post
office
downtown
.

The
farmers
'
market
operates
on
Wednesdays
and
Saturdays
June
through
October
.

There
are
also
plans
to
create
a
more
permanent
site
for
the
farmer
's
market
at
that
site
.

The
City
of
Gaffney
plans
to
build
a
partial
replica
of
the
old
train
depot
that
was
once
located
there
.

The
partial
replica
will
house
a
portion
of
the
farmer
's
market
,
and
also
act
as
a
landmark
that
calls
back
to
the
days
of
the
old
depot
.

The
city
recently
concluded
Spring
Session
'00
of
a
popular
concert
series
entitled
Shindig
at
the
Gaffney
Cabin
.

Bands
perform
on
a
weekly
basis
-
Fridays
during
the
Spring
Session
(
May
)
and
Thursdays
during
the
Fall
Session
(
late
August
through
September
)
.

Concerts
are
held
on
Thursdays
during
Fall
Sessions
so
as
not
to
conflict
with
Gaffney
Indian
football
games
on
Friday
nights
.

The
City
will
hold
more
of
those
concerts
in
0000
,
this
time
from
April
to
June
0000
,
and
again
from
August
to
October
of
the
same
year
.

Two
serial

at
different
times
attacked
residents
of
Gaffney
.

In

Lee
Roy
Martin
,
known
as
the
Gaffney

,
killed
four
women
.

In

.

0000
spree
killings
The
city
of
Gaffney
and
surrounding
Cherokee
County
came
into
the
national
spotlight
during
the
summer
of
0000
when
a
spree
killer
began
killing
residents
of
the
rural
town
.

The
first
victim
,
a
prominent
peach
farmer
from
western
Cherokee
County
,
was
killed
on
June
00
.

On
July
0
,
the
killer
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
an
00-year-old
woman
and
her
00-year-old
daughter
.

The
two
were
found
bound
and
shot
to
death
in
the
elder
woman
's
home
near
Gaffney
.

On
July
0
,
00-year-old
Stephen
Tyler
was
shot
and
killed
in
his
appliance
and
furniture
store
;
his
teenage
daughter
,
Abby
,
was
critically
wounded
;
she
died
of
her
injuries
two
days
later
.

The
news
spread
quickly
from
the
local
newspaper
to
national
and
international
media
outlets
including
CNN
,
ABC
News
,
The
Wall
Street

,
and
the

.

On
July
0
,
police
responding
to
an
emergency
call
of
a
burglary
in
progress
in
Gaston
County
,
North
Carolina
shot
and
killed
a
suspect
who
drew
a
gun
on
them
,
injuring
one
officer
.

Ballistic
tests
and
checks
on
the
suspect
's
SUV
indicated
this
to
be
the
wanted
killer
,
later
identified
as
Patrick

The
Peachoid
is
a
water
tower
shaped
like
a

which
some
think
of
as
an
erotic
sculpture
upon

In
linear
algebra
,
the
Cholesky
decomposition
or
Cholesky
triangle
is
a
decomposition
of
a
Hermitian
,
positive-definite
matrix
into
the
product
of
a
lower
triangular
matrix
and
its
conjugate
transpose
.

It
was
discovered
by
André-Louis
Cholesky
for
real
matrices
.

When
it
is
applicable
,
the
Cholesky
decomposition
is
roughly
twice
as
efficient
as
the
LU
decomposition
for
solving
systems
of
linear
equations
.

Statement
The
Cholesky
decomposition
of
a
Hermitian
positive-definite
matrix
A
is
a
decomposition
of
the
form
where
L
is
a
lower
triangular
matrix
with
positive
diagonal
entries
,
and
L
*
denotes
the
conjugate
transpose
of
L.
Every
Hermitian
positive-definite
matrix
(
and
thus
also
every
real-valued
symmetric
positive-definite
matrix
)
has
a
unique
Cholesky
decomposition
.

If
the
matrix
A
is
Hermitian
and
positive
semi-definite
,
then
it
still
has
a
decomposition
of
the
form
A
=
LL
*
if
the
diagonal
entries
of
L
are
allowed
to
be
zero
.

When
A
has
real
entries
,
L
has
real
entries
as
well
.

The
Cholesky
decomposition
is
unique
when
A
is
positive
definite
;
there
is
only
one
lower
triangular
matrix
L
with
strictly
positive
diagonal
entries
such
that
A
=
LL
*
.

However
,
the
decomposition
need
not
be
unique
when
A
is
positive
semidefinite
.

The
converse
holds
trivially
:
if
A
can
be
written
as
LL
*
for
some
invertible
L
,
lower
triangular
or
otherwise
,
then
A
is
Hermitian
and
positive
definite
.

LDL
decomposition
A
closely
related
variant
of
the
classical
Cholesky
decomposition
is
the
LDL
decomposition
,
where
L
is
a
lower
unitriangular
matrix
and
D
is
a
diagonal
matrix
.

This
decomposition
is
related
to
the
classical
Cholesky
decomposition
,
of
the
form
LL
*
,
as
follows
:
The
LDL
variant
,
if
efficiently
implemented
,
requires
the
same
space
and
computational
complexity
to
construct
and
use
but
avoids
extracting
square
roots
.

Some
indefinite
matrices
for
which
no
Cholesky
decomposition
exists
have
an
LDL
decomposition
with
negative
entries
in
D.
For
these
reasons
,
the
LDL
decomposition
is
often
preferred
.

For
real
matrices
,
it
is
often
referred
to
in
speech
as
the
LDLT
decomposition
because
it
has
the
form
A
=
LDLT
.

It
is
closely
related
to
the
eigendecomposition
of
real
symmetric
matrices
,
A
=
QΛQT
.

Example
Here
is
the
Cholesky
decomposition
of
a
symmetric
real
matrix
:
And
here
is
the
LDLT
decomposition
of
the
same
matrix
:
Applications
The
Cholesky
decomposition
is
mainly
used
for
the
numerical
solution
of
linear
equations
Ax
=
b.
If
A
is
symmetric
and
positive
definite
,
then
we
can
solve
Ax
=
b
by
first
computing
the
Cholesky
decomposition
A
=
LL
*
,
then
solving
Ly
=
b
for
y
by
forward
substitution
,
and
finally
solving
L
*
x
=
y
for
x
by
back
substitution
.

For
linear
systems
that
can
be
put
into
symmetric
form
,
the
Cholesky
decomposition
(
or
its
LDL
variant
)
is
the
method
of
choice
,
for
superior
efficiency
and
numerical
stability
.

Compared
to
the
LU
decomposition
,
it
is
roughly
twice
as
efficient
.

Linear
least
squares
Systems
of
the
form
Ax
=
b
with
A
symmetric
and
positive
definite
arise
quite
often
in
applications
.

For
instance
,
the
normal
equations
in
linear
least
squares
problems
are
of
this
form
.

It
may
also
happen
that
matrix
A
comes
from
an
energy
functional
which
must
be
positive
from
physical
considerations
;
this
happens
frequently
in
the
numerical
solution
of
partial
differential
equation
s.

method
called
quasi-Newton
methods
.

At
each
iteration
,
the
search
takes
a
step
s
defined
by
solving
Hs
=
-
g
for
s
,
where
s
is
the
step
,
g
is
the
gradient
vector
of
the
function
's
partial
first
derivatives
with
respect
to
the
parameters
,
and
H
is
an
approximation
to
the
Hessian
matrix
of
partial
second
derivatives
formed
by
repeated
rank
0
updates
at
each
iteration
.

Two
well-known
update
formulae
are
called
Davidon-Fletcher-Powell
(
DFP
)
and
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
(
BFGS
)
.

Loss
of
the
positive-definite
condition
through
round-off
error
is
avoided
if
rather
than
updating
an
approximation
to
the
inverse
of
the
Hessian
,
one
updates
the
Cholesky
decomposition
of
an
approximation
of
the
Hessian
matrix
itself
.

Monte
Carlo
simulation
The
Cholesky
decomposition
is
commonly
used
in
the
Monte
Carlo
method
for
simulating
systems
with
multiple
correlated
variables
:
The
correlation
matrix
is
decomposed
,
to
give
the
lower-triangular
L.
Applying
this
to
a
vector
of
uncorrelated
samples
,
u
,
produces
a
sample
vector
Lu
with
the
covariance
properties
of
the
system
being
modeled
.

Kalman
filters
Unscented
Kalman
filter
s
commonly
use
the
Cholesky
decomposition
to
choose
a
set
of
so-called
sigma
points
.

The
Kalman
filter
tracks
the
average
state
of
a
system
as
a
vector
x
of
length
N
and
covariance
as
an
N-by-N
matrix
P.
The
matrix
P
is
always
positive
semi-definite
,
and
can
be
decomposed
into
LLT
.

The
columns
of
L
can
be
added
and
subtracted
from
the
mean
x
to
form
a
set
of
0N
vectors
called
sigma
points
.

These
sigma
points
completely
capture
the
mean
and
covariance
of
the
system
state
.

Matrix
inversion
The
explicit
inverse
of
a
Hermitian
matrix
can
be
computed
via
Cholesky
decomposition
,
in
a
manner
similar
to
solving
linear
systems
,
using
½
n0
operations
.

The
entire
inversion
can
even
be
efficiently
performed
in-place
.

A
non-Hermitian
matrix
B
can
also
be
inverted
using
the
following
identity
,
where
BB
*
will
always
be
Hermitian
:
Computation
There
are
various
methods
for
calculating
the
Cholesky
decomposition
.

The
computational
complexity
of
commonly
used
algorithms
is
O
(
n0
)
in
general
.

The
algorithms
described
below
all
involve
about
n0/0
FLOP
s
,
where
n
is
the
size
of
the
matrix
A.
Hence
,
they
are
half
the
cost
of
the
LU
decomposition
,
which
uses
0n0/0
FLOPs
(
see
Trefethen
and
Bau
0000
)
.

Which
of
the
algorithms
below
is
faster
depends
on
the
details
of
the
implementation
.

Generally
,
the
first
algorithm
will
be
slightly
slower
because
it
accesses
the
data
in
a
more
irregular
manner
.

The
Cholesky
algorithm
The
Cholesky
algorithm
,
used
to
calculate
the
decomposition
matrix
L
,
is
a
modified
version
of
Gaussian
elimination
.

The
recursive
algorithm
starts
with
i
:
=
0
and
At
step
i
,
the
matrix
A
(
i
)
has
the
following
form
:
where
Ii
−
0
denotes
the
identity
matrix
of
dimension
i
−
0
.

If
we
now
define
the
matrix
Li
by
then
we
can
write
A
(
i
)
as
where
Note
that
bi
b
*
i
is
an
outer
product
,
therefore
this
algorithm
is
called
the
outer
product
version
in
(
Golub
&
Van
Loan
)
.

We
repeat
this
for
i
from
0
to
n.
After
n
steps
,
we
get
A
(
n
+0
)
=
I.
Hence
,
the
lower
triangular
matrix
L
we
are
looking
for
is
calculated
as

Access
pattern
(
white
)
and
w
If
we
write
out
the
equation
A
=
LL
*
,
we
obtain
the
following
formula
for
the
entries
of
L
:
The
expression
under
the
square
root
is
always
positive
if
A
is
real
and
positive-definite
.

For
complex
Hermitian
matrix
,
the
following
formula
applies
:
So
we
can
compute
the
(
i
,
j
)
entry
if
we
know
the
entries
to
the
left
and
above
.

The
computation
is
usually
arranged
in
either
of
the
following
orders
.

Either
pattern
of
access
allows
the
entire
computation
to
be
performed
in-place
if
desired
.

Stability
of
the
computation
Suppose
that
we
want
to
solve
a
well-conditioned
system
of
linear
equations
.

If
the
LU
decomposition
is
used
,
then
the
algorithm
is
unstable
unless
we
use
some
sort
of
pivoting
strategy
.

In
the
latter
case
,
the
error
depends
on
the
so-called
growth
factor
of
the
matrix
,
which
is
usually
(
but
not
always
)
small
.

Now
,
suppose
that
the
Cholesky
decomposition
is
applicable
.

As
mentioned
above
,
the
algorithm
will
be
twice
as
fast
.

Furthermore
,
no
pivoting
is
necessary
and
the
error
will
always
be
small
.

Specifically
,
if
we
want
to
solve
Ax
=
b
,
and
y
denotes
the
computed
solution
,
then
y
solves
the
disturbed
system
(
A
+
E
)
y
=
b
where
Here
,
|
|
|
|
0
is
the
matrix
0-norm
,
cn
is
a
small
constant
depending
on
n
,
and
ε
denotes
the
unit
round-off
.

One
concern
with
the
Cholesky
decomposition
to
be
aware
of
is
the
use
of
square
roots
.

If
the
matrix
being
factorized
is
positive
definite
as
required
,
the
numbers
under
the
square
roots
are
always
positive
in
exact
arithmetic
.

Unfortunately
,
the
numbers
can
become
negative
because
of
round-off
error
s
,
in
which
case
the
algorithm
can
not
continue
.

However
,
this
can
only
happen
if
the
matrix
is
very
ill-conditioned
.

One
way
to
address
this
is
to
add
a
diagonal
correction
matrix
to
the
matrix
being
decomposed
in
an
attempt
to
promote
the
positive-definiteness
.

While
this
might
lessen
the
accuracy
of
the
decomposition
,
it
can
be
very
favorable
for
other
reasons
;
for
example
,
when
performing
Newton
's
method
in
optimization
,
adding
a
diagonal
matrix
can
improve
stability
when
far
from
the
optimum
.

LDL
decomposition
An
alternative
form
,
eliminating
the
need
to
take
square
roots
,
is
the
symmetric
indefinite
factorization
If
A
is
real
,
the
following
recursive
relations
apply
for
the
entries
of
D
and
L
:
For
complex
Hermitian
matrix
A
,
the
following
formula
applies
:
Again
,
the
pattern
of
access
allows
the
entire
computation
to
be
performed
in-place
if
desired
.

Block
variant
When
used
on
indefinite
matrices
,
the
LDL
*
factorization
is
known
to
be
unstable
without
careful
pivoting
;
specifically
,
the
elements
of
the
factorization
can
grow
arbitrarily
.

A
possible
improvement
is
to
perform
the
factorization
on
block
sub-matrices
,
commonly
0x0
:
where
every
element
in
the
matrices
above
is
a
square
submatrix
.

From
this
,
these
analogous
recursive
relations
follow
:
Note
the
presence
of
matrix
products
and
explicit
inversion
,
this
limits
the
practical
block
size
.

Updating
the
decomposition
A
task
that
often
arises
in
practice
is
that
one
needs
to
update
a
Cholesky
decomposition
.

In
more
details
,
one
has
already
computed
the
Cholesky
decomposition
A
=
LL
*
of
some
matrix
A
,
then
one
changes
the
matrix
A
in
some
way
into
another
matrix
,
say
\
tilde
,
and
one
wants
to
compute
the
Cholesky
decomposition
of
the
updated
matrix
:
\
tilde
=
\
tilde
\
tilde
^
*
.

The
question
is
now
whether
one
can
use
the
Cholesky
decomposition
of
A
that
was
computed
before
to
compute
the
Cholesky
decomposition
of
\
tilde
.

Rank-one
updateThe
specific
case
,
where
the
updated
matrix
\
tilde
is
related
to
the
matrix
A
by
\
tilde
=
\
mathbf
+
\
mathbf
\
mathbf
^
*
,
is
known
as
a
rank-one
update
.

Here
is
a
little
function
based
on
written
in
Matlab
syntax
which
realizes
a
rank-one
update
:
function
[
L
]
=
cholupdate
(
L
,
x
)
p
=
length
(
x
)
;
x
=
x
'
;
for
k
=
0
:p
r
=
sqrt
(
L
(
k
,
k
)
^
0
+
x
(
k
)
^
0
)
;
c
=
r
/
L
(
k
,
k
)
;
s
=
x
(
k
)
/
L
(
k
,
k
)
;
L
(
k
,
k
)
=
r
;
L
(
k
,
k
+0
:p
)
=
(
L
(
k
,
k
+0
:p
)
+
s
*
x
(
k
+0
:p
)
)
/
c
;
x
(
k
+0
:p
)
=
c
*
x
(
k
+0
:p
)
-
s
*
L
(
k
,
k
+0
:p
)
;
end
end
Rank-one
downdateA
rank-one
downdate
is
similar
to
a
rank-one
update
,
except
that
the
addition
is
replaced
by
subtraction
:
\
tilde
=
\
mathbf
-
\
mathbf
\
mathbf
^
*
.

This
only
works
if
the
new
matrix
\
tilde
is
still
definite
positive
,
which
is
the
case
if
every
element
of
the
vector
x
is
bigger
in
absolute
value
than
the
corresponding
element
on
the
diagonal
of
L.
The
code
for
the
rank-one
update
shown
above
can
easily
be
adapted
to
do
a
rank-one
downdate
:
one
merely
needs
to
replace
the
two
additions
in
the
assignment
to
r
and
L
(
k
,
k
+0
:p
)
by
subtractions
.

Proof
for
positive
semi-definite
matrices
The
above
algorithms
show
that
every
positive
definite
matrix
A
has
a
Cholesky
decomposition
.

This
result
can
be
extended
to
the
positive
semi-definite
case
by
a
limiting
argument
.

The
argument
is
not
fully
constructive
,
i.e.
,
it
gives
no
explicit
numerical
algorithms
for
computing
Cholesky
factors
.

If
A
is
an
n-by-n
positive
semi-definite
matrix
,
then
the
sequence
=
consists
of
positive
definite
matrices
.

(
This
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
,
for
example
,
the
spectral
mapping
theorem
for
the
polynomial
functional
calculus
.
)

Also
,
in
operator
norm
.

From
the
positive
definite
case
,
each
Ak
has
Cholesky
decomposition
Ak
=
LkL
*
k.
By
property
of
the
operator
norm
,
So
is
a
bounded
set
in
the
Banach
space
of
operators
,
therefore
relatively
compact
(
because
the
underlying
vector
space
is
finite
dimensional
)
.

Consequently
it
has
a
convergent
subsequence
,
also
denoted
by
,
with
limit
L.
It
can
be
easily
checked
that
this
L
has
the
desired
properties
,
i.e.
.

A
=
LL
*
and
L
is
lower
triangular
with
non-negative
diagonal
entries
:
for
all
x
and
y
,
Therefore
A
=
LL
*
.

Because
the
underlying
vector
space
is
finite
dimensional
,
all
topologies
on
the
space
of
operators
are
equivalent
.

So
Lk
tends
to
L
in
norm
means
Lk
tends
to
L
entrywise
.

This
in
turn
implies
that
,
since
each
Lk
is
lower
triangular
with
non-negative
diagonal
entries
,
L
is
also
.

Generalization
The
Cholesky
factorization
can
be
generalized
to
(
not
necessarily
finite
)
matrices
with
operator
entries
.

Let
\
be
a
sequence
of
Hilbert
spaces
.

Consider
the
operator
matrix
acting
on
the
direct
sum
where
each
is
a
bounded
operator
.

If
A
is
positive
(
semidefinite
)
in
the
sense
that
for
all
finite
k
and
for
any
we
have
\
langle
h
,
\
mathbf
h
\
rangle
\
ge
0
,
then
there
exists
a
lower
triangular
operator
matrix
L
such
that
A
=
LL
*
.

One
can
also
take
the
diagonal
entries
of
L
to
be
positive
.

In
Matlab
and
R
Programming
In
Matlab
Programming
,
the
"
Chol
"
command
can
be
used
to
simply
apply
this
to
a
matrix
.

Please

documents

In

the

Culture
The
town
of
Great
Falls
hosts
an
annual
Flopeye
Fish
Festival
.

Great
Falls
was
a
thriving
metropolis
and
a
real
boomtown
in
the
early
0000s
.

It
was
founded
on
the
old
US
00
peddler
's
route
from
Charleston
to
the
mountains
of
North
Carolina
and
beyond
,
The
trade
route
of
its
time
.

After
a
hydroelectric
plant
was
built
and
was
powering
the
first
of
three
cotton
mills
,
the
'
company
sto
'
near
the
plant
provided
the
workers
with
everything
that
they
could
possibly
need
...
at
whatever
price
they
felt
like
they
could
get
,
and
simply
deducted
that
from
the
workers
'
wages
.

Up
the
road
,
or
'
down
,
'
depending
on
your
perspective
,
a
merchant
(
who
may
have
been
named
Andy
Morrison
)
who
had
a
lazy
,
or
drooping
,
eyelid
(
s
)
,
would
laze
around
his
store
,
selling
many
of
the
same
items
at
lower
prices
,
of
course
.

The
company
tried
to
discourage
its
workers
from
trading
with
'
that
old
flopeyed
man
'
down
the
road
.

However
,
people
liked
his
prices
,
and
seemed
to
genuinely
like
old
'
Flopeye
.
'

They
built
up
a
separate
business
area
,
and
a
surrounding
village
in
the
area
around
Flopeye
.

There
were
,
and
still
are
,
two
separate
and
distinct
business
areas
in
Great
Falls
.

,
where
the
Company
Store
was

Cheraw
(
,
)
is
a
town
on
the
Pee
Dee
River
in
Chesterfield
County
,
South
Carolina
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
and
center
of
an
urban
cluster
with
a
total
population
of
0,000
.

It
has
been
nicknamed
"
The
Prettiest
Town
in
Dixie
.
"

The
harbor
tug
USS
Cheraw
was
named
in
the
town
's
honor
.

History
Origins
At
the
time
of
European
encounter
,
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
area
were
the
Cheraw
and
Pee
Dee
American
Indian
tribes
.

The
Cheraw
lived
near
the
river
hill
,
near
present-day
Cheraw
,
but
by
the
0000s
they
had
been
devastated
by
disease
.

Survivors
joined
the
Catawba
Confederacy
for
safety
and
left
their
name
in
history
.

Only
a
few
scattered
Cheraw
families
remained
by
the
time
of
the
American
Revolution
.

A
few
European
settlers
entered
their
territory
in
the
0000s
,
forced
upriver
when
the
Welsh
came
to
claim
the
Welsh
Baptist
lands
granted
by
the
English
government
in
the
area
around
Society
Hill
.

Many
of
the
early
settlers
around
the
0000s
in
Cheraw
were
ethnic
English
,
Scots
,
French
Huguenots
,
or
Irish
.

By
0000
,
Cheraw
had
become
an
established
Anglo-American
village
with
a
growing
river
trade
,
one
of
the
first
inland
villages
.

It
was
one
of
only
six
places
in
South
Carolina
that
appeared
on
English
maps
.

In
the
0000s
,
Joseph
and
Eli
Kershaw
were
granted
the
part
of
Cheraw
that
is
now
the
downtown
historic
district
.

The
Kershaws
laid
out
a
formal
street
system
.

By
0000
settlers
lined
all
the
streets
with
rows
of
elms
.

The
Kershaws
originally
called
the
town
Chatham
,
but
people
never
accepted
this
name
,
continuing
to
call
it
Cheraw
or
Cheraw
Hill
.

It
was
incorporated
as
a
town
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
first
steamboat
came
up
river
,
and
along
with
it
a
burst
of
prosperity
.

The
main
crops
from
the
Cheraw
area
were
corn
,
cotton
,
tobacco
,
rice
and
indigo
.

Cheraw
had
the
largest
cotton
market
between
Georgetown
,
South
Carolina
and
Wilmington
,
North
Carolina
.

Because
of
the
cotton
trade
,
the
town
boasted
the
largest
bank
in
South
Carolina
outside
of
Charleston
before
the
American
Civil
War
.

Despite
a
serious
fire
in
0000
,
by
0000
the
town
was
prosperous
center
of
trade
.

American
Revolution
There
was
a
lack
of
organization
and
rule
during
the
beginning
of
the
0000s
in
the
backcountry
of
South
Carolina
.

This
lack
of
organization
and
unrest
was
an
underlying
cause
of
the
resentment
people
of
these
areas
felt
toward
the
British
crown
.

In
the
Pee
Dee
area
,
planters
organized
a
group
called
the
Regulators
to
help
bring
order
to
the
area
.

In
0000
the
St.
David
’s
Parish
,
the
last
Anglican
Church
built
in
South
Carolina
under
King
George
III
,
was
established
to
help
serve
the
civic
and
religious
needs
of
the
Cheraw
area
.

Later
a
Judicial
District
and
courthouse
were
established
to
help
deal
with
the
problem
of
order
.

However
,
there
was
still
much
discontent
with
the
ruling
authority
and
in
May
0000
the
grand
jury
of
the
Cheraws
District
Two
declared
its
independence
from
Great
Britain
.

Many
area
men
played
prominent
roles
in
the
American
Revolution
.

These
men
included
Claudius
Pegues
,
General
Henry
W.
Harrington
,
the
Ellerbe
brothers
,
Philip
Pledger
,
and
Eli
Kershaw
.

There
was
much
unrest
in
the
area
during
this
time
because
Cheraw
fell
into
part
of
the
British
strategic
line
of
defense
.

This
British
strategic
line
of
defense
was
where
garrisons
were
built
to
control
revolutionaries
and
to
encourage
loyalists
.

Other
towns
in
this
line
of
defense
included
Camden
and
Augusta
.

It
also
became
a
strategic
point
for
the
Americans
.

Military
activity
was
especially
heavy
in
Cheraw
and
surrounding
counties
from
0000-0000
.

During
the
Revolutionary
war
St.
David
’s
Church
was
used
as
quarters
for
the
South
Carolina
militia
and
as
a
hospital
for
the
British
troops
under
Major
McArthur
,
who
under
Lord
Cornwallis
’s
command
.

In
December
of
0000
,
just
across
from
Cheraw
,
American
commander
General
Nathanael
Greene
set
up
a
“
camp
of
repose
"
to
rest
and
train
his
men
.

Civil
War
Leading
up
to
the
American
Civil
War
,
Cheraw
citizens
played
a
key
role
in
South
Carolina
’s
Secession
from
the
Union
.

On
November
00
,
0000
the
first
call
for
secession
in
a
public
meeting
was
made
at
the
Chesterfield
County
Courthouse
.

John
A.
Inglis
of
Cheraw
was
in
attendance
.

He
later
introduced
the
resolution
for
South
Carolina
to
secede
.

Inglis
was
also
named
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
wrote
the
document
for
South
Carolina
’s
secession
.

From
the
beginning
of
the
war
,
Cheraw
was
known
as
a
place
for
refuge
and
a
storehouse
for
valuables
.

In
March
0000
,
General
William
T.
Sherman
brought
his
Union
troops
to
Cheraw
for
several
days
.

One
Union
soldier
said
that
they
found
Cheraw
to
be
“
a
pleasant
town
and
an
old
one
with
the
Southern
aristocratic
bearing
.

”
Sherman
used
this
as
a
time
to
gain
more
control
over
his
men
.

No
private
dwellings
or
public
buildings
in
Cheraw
were
destroyed
by
Sherman
and
his
troops
.

However
,
an
accidental
explosion
of
captured
gunpowder
at
the
river
hill
burned
the
Cheraw
business
district
.

The
county
courthouse
in
Chesterfield
was
burned
.

Thus
,
it
is
difficult
to
date
many
of
the
properties
.

During
the
Civil
War
,
St.
David
’s
Church
was
used
as
a
hospital
by
both
the
Confederate
and
Union
armies
.

Some
troops
from
both
armies
were
buried
there
.

The
first
Confederate
Monument
was
erected
there
in
0000
.

Originally
,
the
monument
did
not
mention
the
Confederate
soldiers
because
the
area
was
still
occupied
by
Federal
troops
.

The
Civil
War
caused
great
economic
hardship
in
Cheraw
,
as
it
did
in
the
entire
South
.

However
by
the
early
0000s
,
prosperity
began
to
return
to
Cheraw
.

The
Great
Depression
again
brought
change
.

Cheraw
State
Park
and
Sandhills
State
Forest
were
both
founded
in
the
0000s
.

By
the
0000s
and
0000s
the
groundwork
was
laid
for
industrial
growth
.

By
the
end
of
the
00th
century
,
Cheraw
had
a
balanced
industrial
base
while
maintaining
its
historic
charm
,
architectural
treasures
and
natural
resources
.

Geography
Cheraw
is
at
the

,
plus
whatever
funds

On
the
second
Monday
of
the
following
October
,
the
new
district
officers
were
elected
,
and
Clarendon
began
its
separate
existence
from
Sumter
District
with
Manning
as
its
county
seat
.

The
city
is
named
for
John
Laurence
Manning
,
who
was
elected
to
both
chambers
in
the
General
Assembly
,
and
was
chosen
by
the
Assembly
to
serve
as
governor
from
0000
to
0000
.

George
Allen
Huggins
was
the
first
intendant
(
mayor
)
of
Manning
.

Manning
's
Post
Office
was
established
in
0000
and
Thomas
S.
Coogler
was
the
first
Postmaster
.

Manning
's
first
library
,
the
Hannah
Levi
Memorial
Library
,
was
completed
in
0000
.

It
eventually
became
known
as
the
Manning
Library
and
was
the
only
public
library
in
the
county
.

It
became
a
county
library
in
0000
and
continued
to
operate
until
the
opening
of
the
Harvin
Clarendon
County
Library
in
0000
.

The
building
now
houses
the
Clarendon
County
Archives
and

A
large
portion
of
the

the
court
house
,

during
what
is
known
as
"
Potter
's
Raid
"
.

Manning
was
later
struck
by
a
downtown
fire
in
0000
and
a
tornado
in
0000
.

Railroads
,
abundant
timber
and
diverse
agriculture
allowed

flourish
during
the
late
00th
century
and
into
the
00th
century
.

In
0000
,
Highway
0
was
changed

000
and
thanks
in
part
to
the
efforts
of
Manning
resident
W.
P.
Legg
,
Manning
and
Clarendon
County
became
a
preferred
route
of
the
Washington

I-00
corridor
and
attracts
retirees
looking

Manning
was
one
of
many
towns
across
the

peaceful
Civil
Rights
demonstrations
and
sit-ins
.

Unlike
some
other
areas
the
demonstrations
in
Manning
