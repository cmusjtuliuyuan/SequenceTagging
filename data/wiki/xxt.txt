It
was
organized
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
received
its
charter
as
a
Federal
bank
on
March
00
,
0000
.

It
served
the
Portland
area
continuously
except
for
a
period
during
0000
when
it
closed
its
doors
under
the
pressure
of
the
Great
Depression
.

The
population
of
the
Portland
community
has
remained
stable
during
most
of
the
past
one
hundred
years
.

Since
the
business
community
exists
essentially
to
serve
the
townspeople
,
it
too
has
remained
constant
.

However
,
it
has
kept
pace
with
the
changing
times
.

The
number
of
businesses
has
not
varied
,
but
the
types
have
changed
to
keep
pace
with
modern
times
.

Virtually
all
the
businesses
are
owned
by
people
who
live
in
Portland
or
nearby
communities
,
therefore
these
businesspeople
not
only
have
a
sense
of
pride
in
their
own
stores
,
but
in
the
community
as
well
.

The
Delaware
River
provided
easy
transport
.

At
first
only
the
Indians
skimmed
their
canoes
over
its
surface
,
but
by
the
mid-00th
century
,
rafts
were
in
use
during
spring
floods
.

As
late
as
0000
,
the
river
near
Portland
would
be
full
of
rafts
as
far
was
the
eye
could
see
.

Rafting
started
to
wane
in
the
0000s
because
railroads
had
reached
the
lumbering
country
.

The
Portland
Covered
Bridge
had
its
beginnings
as
early
as
February
0
,
0000
.

Records
indicate
that
Francis
Myerhoff
,
owner
of
the
Columbia
Glass
Works
,
received
a
charter
from
the
State
of
New
Jersey
to
build
a
bridge
across
the
river
to
help
in
the
delivery
of
the
sand
he
needed
for
his
factory
in
New
Jersey
.

Early
in
January
,
0000
,
the
bridge
was
finally
completed
by
the
Charles
,
Kellogg
and
Maurice
Company
of
Athens
,
Pennsylvania
(
later
the
Union
Bridge
Company
)
.

According
to
an
Easton
paper
of
January
00
,
0000
,
Mrs.
Sophia
Sandt
rode
from
Pennsylvania
to
New
Jersey
and
back
again
in
her
sleigh
“
amidst
the
applause
of
the
people
.

”
The
bridge
,
of
the
Burr
Truss
type
,
was
000
feet
long
,
00
feet
wide
,
and
cost
about
$
00,000
to
construct
.

The
Great
Flood
of
August
00
,
0000
,
was
too
much
for
the
span
.

Early
in
the
afternoon
of
that
Friday
,
the
center
of
the
bridge
gave
way
to
the
relentless
pounding
of
the
highest
water
ever
recorded
on
the
Delaware
,
and
all
but
the
section
closest
to
the
New
Jersey
side
floated
down
the
river
.

Thus
came
to
an
end
what
was
at
the
time
the
longest
covered
wooden
bridge
in
the
United
States
,
and
the
last
one
spanning
the
Delaware
River
.

The
County
Bridge
No.

was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in

History
The
town
is
named
for
the
village
of
Roseto
Valfortore
in
Italy
.

It
was
largely
settled
by
Italians
employed
at
the
numerous
local
slate
quarries
.

The
Wind
Gap
and
Delaware
Railroad
opened
a
line
through
the
town
in
0000
.

It
was
operated
by
the
Central
Railroad
of
New
Jersey
until
0000
,
after
which
it
was
merged
into
the
Lehigh
and
New
England
Railroad
,
which
abandoned
the
line
in
0000
.

The
three
founders
were
Nicola
Rosato
,
Giovanni
Policelli
,
and
Lorenzo
Falcone
,
and
it
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

A
short
history
of
Roseto
is
included
in
the
introduction
section
of
the
Malcolm
Gladwell
book
,
Outliers
,
particularly
concerning
its
virtual
absence
of
heart
disease
in
the
mid-00th
Century
.

That
data
was
compiled
by
Dr.
Stewart
Wolf
as
part
of
a
massive
study
that
helped
establish
the
idea
that
stress
can
play
a
role
in
the
incidence
of
heart
disease
.

History
The
Borough
of
Stockertown
was
named
for
the
Stockers
,
who
settled
on
the
land
in
the
late
00th
century
.

The
post
village
was
referred
to
as
Stockersville
as
of
0000
,
and
described
as
a
very
fertile
area
.

In
late
0000
,
by
which
time
the
village
was
being
called
Stockertown
,
a
group
of
the
village
's
citizens
petitioned
Northampton
County
Court
to
grant
the
community
the
status
of
a
borough
.

That
petition
was
granted
and
,
early
in
0000
,
the
Borough
government
was
organized
.

In
0000
,
a
cement
plant
(
which
later
became
Hercules
Cement
)
was
constructed
as
The
Nazareth
Works
of
Atlantic
Portland
Cement
Company
.

It
acquired
the
name
of
Hercules
Cement
Company
in
0000
after
its
holdings
after
Atlantic
Portland
Cement
filed
for
bankruptcy
.

It
has
changed
owners
many
times
through
mergers
,
and
as
of
0000
is
owned
by
Buzzi
Unicem
.

Liberty
Hose
Fire
Company
#
0
formed
in
0000
,
and
the
borough
bought
their
first
firetruck
in
0000
.

After
World
War
II
,
Liberty
Hose
opted
to
build
a
memorial
in
honor
of
the
war
's
veterans
.

The
building
became
the
borough
's
Memorial
Hall
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
Liberty
Hose
moved
from
its
original
building
on
Main
Street
to
a
new
facility
along
State
Street
.

This
building
is
now
the
home
to
Stockertown
's
police
offices
and
other
emergency
vehicles
.

In
0000
,
Liberty
Hose
Fire
Company
was
disbanded
.

The
freeway
now
known
as
Route
00
,
which
runs
through
Stockertown
,
began
construction
in
0000
from
Wind
Gap
to
Saylorsburg
.

Meetings
were
first
held
with
residents
of
Stockertown
in
the
mid
0000s
,
and
the
Stockertown
portion
of
the
highway
was
constructed
in
0000
,
opening

Rail
Trail
Stockertown
is
home
to
an
unpaved
,
grassy
rail
trail
,
which
,
once
fully
developed
,
is
slated
to
link
the
Plainfield
Township
Trail
and
the
Palmer
Bikeway
.

The
existing
unpaved
trail
is
about
a
mile
long
,
starting
at
Lincoln
School
Park
,
and
extending
to
Main
Street
at
the
North
edge
of
the
borough
(
Belfast
Junction
)
.

A
missing
link
of
the
trail
,
which
is
still
in
the
planning
stages
,
would
be
a
major
step
towards
a
regional
trail
system
by
connecting
Stockertown
and
Tatamy
.

Another
proposed
trail
would
extend
from
the
Northern
hub
of
the
Stockertown
Rail
Trail
to
Jacobsburg
State
Park
,
adding
connections
to
Bushkill
Township
.

The
Ogallala
Aquifer
,
part
of
the
High
Plains
Aquifer
System
,
is
a
vast
yet
shallow
underground
water
table
aquifer
located
beneath
the
Great
Plains
in
the
United
States
.

One
of
the
world
's
largest
aquifers
,
it
covers
an
area
of
approximately
000,000
mi
²
(
000,000
km
²
)
in
portions
of
the
eight
states
of
South
Dakota
,
Nebraska
,
Wyoming
,
Colorado
,
Kansas
,
Oklahoma
,
New
Mexico
,
and
Texas
.

It
was
named
in
0000
by
N.H.
Darton
from
its
type
locality
near
the
town
of
Ogallala
,
Nebraska
.

The
Ogallala
Formation
underlies
about
00
percent
of
the
High
Plains
and
is
the
principal
geologic
unit
forming
the
High
Plains
Aquifer
.

About
00
percent
of
the
irrigated
land
in
the
United
States
overlies
this
aquifer
system
,
which
yields
about
00
percent
of
all
ground
water
used
for
irrigation
in
the
United
States
.

The
aquifer
system
supplies
drinking
water
to
00
percent
of
the
0.0
million
people
(
0000
census
)
who
live
within
the
boundaries
of
the
High
Plains
study
area
.

General
characteristics
The
deposition
of
the
aquifer
material
dates
back
0
to
0
million
years
,
to
late
Miocene
to
early
Pliocene
age
when
the
southern
Rocky
Mountains
were
still
tectonically
active
.

From
the
uplands
to
the
west
,
rivers
and
streams
cut
channels
in
a
generally
west
to
east
or
southeast
direction
.

Erosion
of
the
Rockies
provided
alluvial
and
aeolian
sediment
that
filled
the
ancient
channels
and
eventually
covered
the
entire
area
of
the
present-day
aquifer
,
forming
the
water-bearing
Ogallala
Formation
.

In
that
respect
,
the
process
is
little
different
from
that
currently
prevailing
in
other
modern
rivers
of
the
area
,
such
as
the
Kansas
River
and
its
tributaries
.

The
major
differences
are
time
and
depth
.

The
depth
of
the
Ogallala
varies
with
the
shape
of
then-prevailing
surface
,
being
deepest
where
it
fills
ancient
valleys
and
channels
.

The
Ogallala
Formation
consists
mostly
of
coarse
sedimentary
rocks
in
its
deeper
sections
,
which
transition
upward
into
finer-grained
material
.

The
water-permeated
thickness
of
the
Ogallala
Formation
ranges
from
a
few
feet
to
more
than
0000
feet
(
000
m
)
and
is
generally
greater
in
the
northern
plains
.

The
depth
of
the
water
below
the
surface
of
the
land
ranges
from
almost
in
parts
of
the
north
to
between
throughout
much
of
the
south
.

Present-day
recharge
of
the
aquifer
with
fresh
water
occurs
at
an
exceedingly
slow
rate
,
suggesting
that
much
of
the
water
in
its
pore
spaces
is
paleowater
,
dating
back
to
the
most
recent
ice
age
and
probably
earlier
.

Aquifer
water
balance
An
aquifer
is
a
groundwater
storage
reservoir
in
the
water
cycle
.

While
groundwater
is
a
renewable
source
,
reserves
replenish
relatively
slowly
.

The
USGS
has
performed
several
studies
of
the
aquifer
,
to
determine
what
is
coming
in
(
groundwater
recharge
from
the
surface
)
,
what
is
leaving
(
water
pumped
out
and
baseflow
to
streams
)
and
what
the
net
changes
in
storage
are
(
rise
,
fall
or
no
change
—
see
figure
above
)
.

Withdrawals
from
the
Ogallala
Aquifer
for
irrigation
amounted
to
in
0000
.

As
of
0000
,
the
total
depletion
since
pre-development
amounted
to
.

Some
estimates
indicate
a
remaining
volume
sufficient
for
as
little
as
00
years
.

Many
farmers
in
the
Texas
High
Plains
,
which
rely
particularly
on
the
underground
source
,
are
now
turning
away
from
irrigated
agriculture
as
they
become
aware
of
the
hazards
of
overpumping
.

Groundwater
recharge
The
rate
at
which
recharge
water
enters
the
aquifer
is
limited
by
several
factors
.

Much
of
the
plains
region
is
semiarid
,
with
steady
winds
that
hasten
evaporation
of
surface
water
and
precipitation
.

In
many
locations
,
the
aquifer
is
overlain
,
in
the
vadose
zone
,
with
a
shallow
layer
of
caliche
that
is
practically
impermeable
;
this
limits
the
amount
of
water
able
to
recharge
the
aquifer
from
the
land
surface
.

However
,
the
soil
of
the
playa
lakes
is
different
and
not
lined
with
caliche
,
making
these
some
of
the
few
areas
where
the
aquifer
can
recharge
.

The
destruction
of
playas
by
farmers
and
development
decreases
the
available
recharge
area
.

The
prevalence
of
the
caliche
is
partly
due
to
the
ready
evaporation
of
soil
moisture
and
the
semiarid
climate
;
the
aridity
increases
the
amount
of
evaporation
,
which
in
turn
increases
the
amount
of
caliche
in
the
soil
.

Both
mechanisms
reduce
the
amount
of
recharge
water
that
reaches
the
water
table
.

Recharge
in
the
aquifer
ranges
from
per
year
in
parts
of
Texas
and
New
Mexico
to
up
to
per
year
in
south-central
Kansas
Groundwater
discharge
The
regions
overlying
the
Ogallala
aquifer
are
some
of
the
most
productive
regions
in
the
United
States
for
ranching
livestock
,
and
growing
corn
,
wheat
,
and
soybeans
.

The
success
of
large-scale
farming
in
areas
that
do
not
have
adequate
precipitation
and
do
not
always
have
perennial
surface
water
for
diversion
has
depended
heavily
on
pumping
groundwater
for
irrigation
.

Early
settlers
of
the
semiarid
High
Plains
were
plagued
by
crop
failures
due
to
cycles
of
drought
,
culminating
in
the
disastrous
Dust
Bowl
of
the
0000s
.

The
aquifer
was
first
tapped
for
irrigation
in
0000
.

Large-scale
use
for
irrigation
began
in
the
0000s
and
continued
through
the
0000s
,
due
to
the
availability
of
electric
power
to
rural
farming
communities
and
the
development
of
cheap
and
efficient
electric
turbine
pump
s.
It
was
only
after
World
War
II
that
affordable
technology
became
available
to
substantially
extract
water
.

This
transformed
the
High
Plains
into
one
of
the
most
agriculturally
productive
regions
in
the
world
.

During
the
early
years
,
this
source
of
water
was
thought
to
be
inexhaustible
,
and
its
hydrology
a
mystery
.

But
,
because
the
rate
of
extraction
exceeds
the
rate
of
recharge
,
water
level
elevations
are
decreasing
.

At
some
places
,
the
water
table
was
measured
to
drop
more
than
five
feet
(
0.0
m
)
per
year
at
the
time
of
maximum
extraction
.

In
extreme
cases
,
the
deepening
of
wells
was
required
to
reach
the
steadily
falling
water
table
.

The
water
table
has
been
drained
(
dewatered
)
in
some
places
,
such
as
the
Texas
Panhandle
.

Using
treated
,
recycled
sources
of
water
in
agriculture
is
one
approach
to
safeguarding
the
future
of
the
aquifer
.

Another
method
of
reducing
the
amount
of
water
use
is
changing
to
crops
that
require
less
water
,
such
as
sunflower
s.
Another
issue
is
that
several
of
the
rivers
in
the
region
,
such
as
the
Platte
,
run
below
the
water
level
of
the
aquifer
.

Because
of
this
,
the
rivers
receive
groundwater
flow
(
baseflow
)
,
carrying
it
out
of
the
region
rather
than
supplying
recharge
to
the
aquifer
.

Change
in
groundwater
storage
The
USGS
estimated
that
total
water
storage
was
about
in
0000
.

This
is
a
decline
of
about
,
or
0
%
,
since
substantial
ground-water
irrigation
development
began
in
the
0000s
.

Water
conservation
practices
(
terracing
and
crop
rotation
)
,
more
efficient
irrigation
methods
(
center
pivot
and
drip
)
,
and
reduced
area
under
irrigation
have
helped
to
slow
depletion
of
the
aquifer
,
but
levels
are
generally
still
dropping
in
areas
including
southwestern
Kansas
and
the
Texas
Panhandle
.

In
other
areas
,
such
as
parts
of
eastern
and
central
Nebraska
and
of
the
region
south
of
Lubbock
,
Texas
,
water
levels
have
risen
since
0000
.

Environmental
controversies
In
the
00st
century
,
recognition
of
the
significance
of
the
aquifer
has
led
to
increased
coverage
from
regional
and
international
journalists
.

In
the
0000s
,
Texas
Panhandle
organic
foods
farmer
and
spokesman
Frank
Ford
successfully
prevented
the
location
of
a
nuclear
waste
repository
in
his
native
Deaf
Smith
County
.

He
opposed
the
site
on
the
grounds
that
the
material
could
poison
the
Ogallala
Aquifer
.

The
repository
was
located
instead
in
Yucca
Mountain
in
Nevada
.

Proposed
Keystone

PipelineIn
0000
,
TransCanada
Corporation
proposed
the
construction
of
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
to
carry
oil
from
the
Athabasca
oil
sands
of
Alberta
to
refineries
near
Houston
,
Texas
.

The
proposed
route
of
the
pipeline
crosses
the
eastern
part
of
the
Nebraska
Sandhills
;
opponents
of
the
route
cite
the
risk
to
the
Ogallala
Aquifer
posed
by
the
possibility
of
contamination
from
spilled
dilute
bitumen
.

As
the
lead
agency
in
the
transboundary
pipeline
project
,
the
U.S.
State
Department
commissioned
an
environmental-impact
assessment
as
required
by
the
National
Environmental
Policy
Act
of
0000
.

The
Environmental
Impact
Statement
concluded
that
the
project
posed
little
threat
of
"
adverse
environmental
impacts
"
,
the
report
was
drafted
by
Cardno
Entrix
,
a
regular
TransCanada
subcontractor
.

While
it
is
"
common
for
companies
applying
to
build
government
projects
to
be
involved
in
assigning
and
paying
for
the
impact
analysis
"
,
U.S.
President
Barack
Obama
cited
the
apparent
conflict
of
interest
in
his
January
0000
decision
to
await
further
environmental
review
.

On
February

a
rally
at
the
National
Mall
drew
an
estimated
00,000
in
protest
of

.

On
0
March
0000
,
the
U.S.
State
Department
released
its
Keystone

Draft
Supplemental
Environmental
Impact
Statement
,
which
concluded
that
a
large
crude
oil
spill
from
the
pipline
that
reached
the
Ogallala
could
spread
as
far
as
0,000
feet
,
with
dissolved
components
spreading
as
much
as
0,000
feet
further
.

Secretary

Also
,
side
AB

Therefore
,
Since

the

Seamanship
is
the
art
of
operating
a
ship
or
boat
.

It
involves
topics
and
development
of
specialised
skills
including
:
navigation
and
international
maritime
law
;
weather
,
meteorology
and
forecasting
;
watchstanding
;
ship-handling
and
small
boat
handling
;
operation
of
deck
equipment
,
anchors
and
cables
;
ropework
and
line
handling
;
communication
s
;
sailing
;
engines
;
execution
of
evolutions
such
as

;

,
dangerous
cargoes
and
cargo
storage
;
dealing
with
emergencies
;
survival
at
sea
and
search
and
rescue
;
fire
fighting
.

The
degree
of
knowledge
needed
within
these
areas
is
dependent
upon
the
nature
of
the
work
and
the
type
of
vessel
employed
by
a
mariner
.

However
,
the
practice
of
good
seamanship
should
be
the
goal
of
all
.

The
deep
meaning
of
the
word
seamanship
derives
from
the
word
seaman
&
ship
.

Thus
it
is
the
seaman
who
makes
a
good
ship
through
his
qualifications
.

Above
all
,
Seamanship
means
Safety
onboard
and
this
is
managed
through
continuous
training
and
implementation
of
good
working
practices
.

Navigation
More
than
just
finding
a
vessel
's
present
location
,
safe
navigation
includes
predicting
future
location
,
route
planning
and
collision
avoidance
.

Nautical
navigation
in
western
nations
,
like
air
navigation
,
is
based
on
the
nautical
mile
Ship-handling
A
fundamental
skill
of
professional
seamanship
is
being
able
to
maneuver
a
vessel
with
accuracy
and
precision
.

Unlike
vehicles
on
land
,
a
ship
afloat
is
subject
to
the
movements
of
the
air
around
it
and
the
water
in
which
it
floats
.

Another
complicating
factor
is
the
mass
of
a
ship
that
has
to
be
accounted
for
when
stopping
and
starting
.

Ship-handling
is
about
arriving
and
departing
a
berth
or
buoy
,
maneuvering
in
confined
channels
and
harbours
and
in
proximity
to
other
ships
,
whilst
at
all
times
navigating
safely
.

Two
other
types
of
operations
,
berthing
alongside
another
ship
and
replenishment
at
sea
,
are
occasionally
included
.

A
key
ability
for
a
ship-handler
is
an
innate
understanding
of
how
the
wind
,
tide
and
swell
,
the
passage
of
other
vessels
,
as
well
as
the
shape
of
the
seabed
,
will
affect
a
vessel
's
movement
,
which
,
together
with
an
understanding
of
a
specific
vessels
performance
,
should
allow
that
vessel
a
safe
passage
.

Fundamental
to
low
speed
maneuvering
is
an
understanding
of
the
configuration
and
handedness
of
the
propeller
(
s
)
.

An
effect
known
as
propeller
walk
will
kick
the
stern
of
the
vessel
to
port
or
starboard
depending
on
the
configuration
and
the
type
of
propeller
when
large
variations
on
propeller
rotation
speed
or
changes
of
propeller
rotation
direction
take
place
.

(
In
single
screw
vessels
where
the
rotation
of
the
propeller
is
reversed
on
an
astern
bell
,
a
standard
was
established
that
the
propeller
would
turn
clockwise
when
viewed
from
astern
.

This
would
mean
that
the
propeller
would
turn
counterclockwise
when
going
astern
and
the
stern
would
walk
to
port
.

This
aided
in
docking
operations
,
where
"
port
side
to
"
was
the
preferred
situation
and
the
vessel
would
be
brought
to
the
dock
with
a
small
bow-in
angle
and
backing
would
flatten
the
angle
,
slow
or
stop
the
vessel
and
walk
it
alongside
.

An
exception
to
this
was
the
U.S.
Sealift
class
tankers
which
used
a
controllable
pitch
propeller
,
where
the
pitch
and
not
the
direction
of
rotation
was
reversed
to
go
astern
.

These
propellers
rotated
counterclockwise
at
all
times
and
so
the
"
walk
"
was
"
normal
"
.
)

Other
variations
include
what
are
known
as
bucket
rudders
such
as
the
Kortz
Nozzle
where
instead
of
a
conventional
rudder
a
pair
of
dish
shaped
rudders
,
one
either
side
of
the
propellor
can
be
swivelled
virtically
to
direct
the
propellor
thrust
through
000
degrees
.

Thus
to
put
the
vessel
into
astern
mode
the
rudder
can
ve
rotated
through
000
degrees
without
altering
the
speed
and
direction
of
the
engine
.

Since
with
the
conventional
propellor/rudder
configuration
the
propellor
is
designed
to
operate
at
maximum
efficiency
when
going
ahead
,
it
produces
far
less
thrust
when
going
astern
.

But
with
the
Kortz
Nozzle
the
ahead
and
astern
thrust
is
the
same
.

Other
advantages
of
the
nozzle
are
the
ship
can
be
steered
astern
which
a
conventional
rudder
can
not
,
and
the
ship
can
be
steered
fully
under
control
to
a
standstill
switching
berween
ahead
and
astern
mode
to
give
complete
control
over
speed
.

In
addition
to
being
fully
conversant
with
the
principles
of
seamanship
and
ship-handling
a
good
pilot
will
have
developed
his
or
her
sense
of
'
situational
awareness
'
to
a
point
well
beyond
that
of
a
member
of
a
ships
crew
,
his
reactions
will
appear
to
be
instinctive
,
positive
and
at
all
times
safe
.

Most
commercial
vessels
in
excess
of
size
limits
determined
by
local
authorities
are
handled
in
confined
areas
by
a
Marine
(
or
maritime
)
pilot
.

Marine
pilots
are
seafarers
with
extensive
seafaring
experience
and
are
usually
qualified
Master
mariners
who
have
been
trained
as
expert
ship-handlers
.

These
pilots
are
conversant
with
all
types
of
vessel
and
propulsion
systems
,
as
well
as
handling
ships
of
all
sizes
in
all
weather
and
tidal
conditions
.

They
are
also
experts
in
the
geographical
areas
they
work
.

In
most
countries
the
pilot
takes
over
the
'
conduct
'
of
the
navigation
from
the
ship
master
.

This
means
that
the
master
&
crew
should
adhere
to
the
pilot
's
orders
in
respect
of
the
safe
navigation
of
the
vessel
when
in
a
compulsory
pilotage
area
.

The
master
may
with
good
cause
resume
'
conduct
'
of
the
vessel
's
navigation
.

However
this
should
never
be
done
lightly
.

In
situations
where
the
Pilot
is
an
"
advisor
"
even
though
he
has
the
,
the
Pilot
or
his
"
Association
"
have
no
responsibility
or
liability
in
the
case
of
an
accident
.

The
Master
,
upon
realizing
there
is
a
dangerous
situation
developing
,
must
take
such
action
as
to
avoid
an
accident
or
at
least
to
minimize
the
damage
from
one
that
ca
n't
be
avoided
.

In
some
countries
and
areas
(
e.g.
Scandinavia
and
the
U.S.A.
)
the
Pilot
's
role
is
an
advisor
.

However
,
in
practice
,
they
are
likely
to
have
the
conduct
of
the
vessel
,
especially
on
larger
ships
using
tug
boats
to
assist
.

The
general
Rule
of
Thumb
is
that
a
Pilot
assumes
command
of
a
vessel
and
is
not
classed
as
"
an
advisor
"
in
the
Panama
Canal
,
crossing
the
sill
of
a
drydock
,
or
in
any
port
in
Russia
(
or
,
perhaps
,
all
the
old
Soviet
States
)
.

This
distinction
is
important
because
when
a
Pilot
is
in
command
,
the
Master
can
not
take
any
action
,
but
is
limited
to
advising
the
Pilot
on
any
circumstance
that
creates
what
he
considers
a
dangerous
situation
.

Progression
in
seamanship
In
the
days
before
mechanical
propulsion
,
an
able
seaman
was
expected
to
be
able
to
"
hand
,
and
reef
,
and
steer
.
"

Training
is
more
formal
in
modern
merchant
marines
and
navies
,
but
still
covers
the
basics
.

The
crew
of
a
large
ship
will
typically
be
organized
into
"
divisions
"
or
"
departments
"
,
each
with
its
own
specialty
.

For
example
,
the
deck
division
would
be
responsible
for
boat
handling
and
general
maintenance
,
while
the
engineering
division
would
be
responsible
for
propulsion
and
other
mechanical
systems
.

Crew
start
on
the
most
basic
duties
and
as
they
gain
experience
and
expertise
advance
within
their
area
.

Crew
who
have
gained
proficiency
become
"
able
seamen
"
,
"
petty
officers
"
,
"
rated
"
,
or
"
mates
"
depending
on
the
organization
to
which
they
belong
.

On
smaller
commercial
craft
,
there
is
little
or
no
specialization
.

Deck
crew
perform
all
boat
handling
functions
.

The
officers
of
the
ship
are
responsible
for
navigation
,
communication
,
and
watch
supervision
.

Captains
must
pass
formal
examinations
to
demonstrate
their
knowledge
.

These
examinations
have
a
progression
based
on
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
craft
.

In
the
U.S.
,
the
progression
begins
with
what
is
known
as
"
the
six
pack
"
,
a
license
that
allows
fishing
guides
to
operate
with
up
to
six
passengers
.

Name
The
official
name
of
the
borough
is
Bloomfield
.

However
the
United
States
Postal
Service
,
presumably
to
avoid
confusion
with
the
neighborhood
of
Pittsburgh
which
is
also
named
Bloomfield
,
refers
to
the
area
as
"
New
Bloomfield
.
"

The
borough
has
not
adopted
the
new
name
and
among
longtime
residents
"
Bloomfield

remains
the
preferred
nomenclature
.

Newer
residents
to
the
county
use
the
postal
name
almost
exclusively
.

Adding
confusion
to
the
issue
is
the
fact
that
area
road
signs
use
both
designations
.

Plot
Tom
Wingo
(
Nick
Nolte
)
,
a
teacher
and
football
coach
from
South
Carolina
,
is
asked
by
his
mother
,
Lila
,
to
travel
to
New
York
to
help
his
twin
sister
's
psychiatrist
,
Susan
Lowenstein
(
Barbra
Streisand
)
,
after
his
sister
Savannah
's
(
Melinda
Dillon
)
latest
suicide
attempt
.

Tom
hates
New
York
and
reluctantly
accepts
,
but
largely
to
take
the
opportunity
to
be
alone
and
away
from
a
life
that
does
not
satisfy
him
.

During
his
initial
meetings
with
Lowenstein
,
Tom
is
reluctant
to
disclose
many
details
of
their
dysfunctional
family
's
secrets
.

In
flashbacks
,
Tom
relates
incidents
from
his
childhood
to
Lowenstein
in
hopes
of
discovering
how
to
save
Savannah
's
life
.

The
Wingo
parents
were
an
abusive
father
and
an
overly
proud
,
status-hungry
mother
.

The
father
was
a
shrimp
boat
operator
and
,
despite
being
successful
at
that
profession
,
spent
all
of
his
money
on
frivolous
business
pursuits
,
leaving
the
family
in
poverty
.

Tom
is
also
torn
with
his
own
problems
,
but
hides
behind
what
he
calls
"
the
Southern
way
"
;
i.e.
,
laughing
about
everything
.

For
example
,
his
wife
Sallie
is
having
an
affair
and
her
lover
wants
to
marry
her
.

Tom
and
Lowenstein
begin
having
feelings
for
each
other
.

After
Tom
discovers
that
she
is
married
to
Herbert
Woodruff
,
a
famous
concert
violin
ist
,
Lowenstein
introduces
Tom
to
her
son
Bernard
(
Jason
Gould
)
,
who
is
being
groomed
to
become
a
musician
as
well
but
who
secretly
wants
to
play
football
.

Tom
starts
coaching
Bernard
along
with
attending
sessions
with
Lowenstein
to
help
his
sister
.

Tom
discovers
that
Savannah
has
been
in
such
a
dissociated
state
that
she
even
had
a
different
identity
,
Renata
Halpern
.

As
Halpern
,
she
wrote
books
to
disguise
the
Savannah
side
of
her
troubled
life
.

Tom
confronts
Lowenstein
over
not
revealing
this
information
before
and
they
argue
,
during
which
she
throws
a
dictionary
at
him
.

To
apologize
,
she
asks
him
to
dinner
and
their
relationship
becomes
closer
.

Tom
has
a
fateful
meeting
with
his
mother
and
stepfather
,
bringing
up
painful
memories
.

Tom
reveals
that
,
when
he
was
00
years
old
,
three
escaped
convict
s
invaded
his
home
and
rape
d
him
,
along
with
his
mother
and
sister
.

His
older
brother
,
Luke
,
killed
two
of
the
aggressors
with
a
shotgun
,
while
his
mother
stabbed
the
third
with
a
kitchen
knife
.

They
buried
the
bodies
beneath
the
house
and
never
spoke
of
it
again
.

Tom
suffers
a
mental
breakdown
,
having
now
let
loose
a
key
piece
of
Savannah
's
troubled
life
.

After
a
session
of
football
,
Herbert
orders
Bernard
to
return
to
his
music
lessons
and
prepare
to
leave
for
Tanglewood
.

Tom
is
invited
to
a
dinner
at
Lowenstein
's
home
,
along
with
poet
s
and
intellectuals
.

Herbert
is
overtly
rude
and
reveals
that
Tom
's
sister
is
in
therapy
with
his
wife
.

Infuriated
,
Lowenstein
voices
her
suspicions
about
her
husband
's
affairs
.

Tom
takes
Herbert
's
"
million
dollar
"
violin
and
threatens
to
throw
it
off
the
balcony
unless
Herbert
apologizes
.

Tom
spends
a
romantic
weekend
with
Lowenstein
at
her
country
house
.

Savannah
recovers
and
is
about
to
be
released
from
the
hospital
when
Tom
realizes
that
he
wants
to
be
closer
to
his
wife
and
children
,
despite
having
fallen
in
love
with
someone
else
.

He
returns
home
,
but
his
last
thoughts
are
of
Lowenstein
.

Cast
Reception
While
the
film
was
a
box
office
hit
and
raised
Streisand
's
reputation
as
a
director
,
its
numerous
changes
from
the
original
novel
upset
some
Conroy
purists
.

Conroy
and
Johnston
eliminated
most
of
the
novel
's
flashback
scenes
.

They
describe
Tom
Wingo
's
relationship
with
his
sibling
s
in
great
detail
.

In
the
novel
,
these
flashbacks
form
the
main
plot
and
take
up
more
of
the
novel
than
the
romance
between
Streisand
's
character
,
Dr.
Lowenstein
,
and
Tom
Wingo
.

The
removal
of
the
flashbacks
makes
the
relationship
between
Wingo
and
Lowenstein
the
central
story
in
the
film
,
whereas
in
the
novel
,
it
is
not
.

Another
character
in
the
novel
-
the
second
Wingo
brother
,
Luke
,
who
appears
only
in
flashbacks
onscreen
-
is
vitally
important
to
the
novel
,
and
his
death
is
a
major
plot
point
.

In
fact
,
the
title
of
the
book
derives
from
a
poem
written
by
Savannah
about
Luke
and
his
struggle
against
the
government
after
the
seizure
of
Colleton
.

In
the
film
,
"
The
Prince
of
Tides
"
is
the
title
of
a
book
of
poetry
written
by
Savannah
and
dedicated
to
Tom
.

Luke
only
appears
intermittently
,
and
only
as
a
child
,
and
his
death
is
only
vaguely
described
.

The
Prince
of
Tides
was
a
box
office
success
,
opening
at
number
four
with
a
grossing
of
$
00,000,000
behind
Hook
,
Beauty
and
the
Beast
,
and
Father
of
the
Bride
,
and
remained
in
the
top
00
for
seven
weeks
.

Eventually
the
final
gross
was
$
00,000,000
.

$
00,000,000
in
rentals
accumulated
,
and
gave
the
film
a
final
gross
of
$
000
million
.

Although
the
film
,
its
cast
,
and
its
crew
received
many
nominations
for
Academy
Awards
,
"
Best
Director
"
was
not
among
these
,
while
"
Best
Picture
"
was
.

At
the
following
year
's
Oscar
ceremonies
,
host
Billy
Crystal
sang
,
to
the
tune
of
"
Do
n't
Rain
on
My
Parade
,
"
"
did
this
film
direct
itself
?
"

The
following
year
,
when
A
Few
Good
Men
joined
Prince
of
Tides
and
the
previous
year
's
Awakenings
in
being
nominated
for
the
latter
award
,
but
not
the
former
,
Columbia
Pictures
president
Mark
Canton
issued
a
statement
,
"
This
is
unfortunately
the
third
year
in
a
row
that
Columbia
has
had
a
film
nominated
for
best
picture
that
seemingly
directed
itself
.
"

Awards
Soundtrack
Streisand
initially
hired
English
composer
John
Barry
to
write
a
score
for
the
film
,
but
Barry
eventually
left
due
to
creative
differences
.

In
a
0
March
0000
Cinemusic
conference
interview
,
Barry
explained
his
exodus
from
the
film
,
stating
,
"
I
was
asked
by
Barbra
Streisand
to
do
The
Prince
of
Tides
–
I
live
in
New
York
,
she
lives
in
Los
Angeles
–
and
I
went
and
met
with
her
,
and
she
showed
me
some
footage
,
and
she
said
,
'
Why
are
n't
you
moving
to
Los
Angeles
?
'

and
I
said
,
'
Absolutely
not
.
'

And
she
said
,
'
Well
,
I
like
to
know
what
's
going
on
'
–
Barbra
's
an
extreme
case
,
by
the
way
–
and
I
said
,
'
Even
if
I
did
move
to
Los
Angeles
,
I
have
no
desire
to
meet
with
you
once
I
know
what
I
'm
going
to
do
.

I
ca
n't
work
with
someone
over
my
shoulder
,
absolutely
no
way
.
'
"

Barry
later
retitled
his
theme
for
The
Prince
of
Tides
"
Moviola
"
and
it
was
released
on
his
0000
movie
theme
album
of
the
same
name
.

The
theme
also
appeared
in
Barry
's
0000
score
for
the
0D
IMAX
film
Across
the
Sea
of
Time
,
retitled
"
Flight
Over
New
York
"
.

The
final
film
score
was
composed
by
James
Newton
Howard
and
released
00
November
0000
.

It
was
well-received
by
critics
and
garnered
Howard
his
first
Academy
Award
nomination
for
Best
Original
Score
,
though
it
lost
to
Alan
Menken
's
music
for
Beauty
and
the
Beast
.

The
soundtrack
contains
two
songs
by
Streisand
,
although
they
did
not
appear
in
the
film
(
one
of
those
songs
,
"
Places
That
Belong
To
You
"
,
was
at
one
point
intended
for
the
film
's
end
credits
,
but
replaced
with
new
music
by
Howard
in
the
released
version
)
.

The
film
also
includes
songs
and
music
that
do
not
appear
on
any
soundtracks

outlaw
and
killer
who

on
one
more
job
years
after

.

A

aspects
of
violence

the
myth
of
the
Old
West
,
it
stars
Eastwood
in
the
lead
role
,
with
Gene
Hackman
,
Morgan
Freeman
,
and
Richard
Harris
.

added
to
the
United
States

,
following

Plot
A
group
of
prostitutes
in
Big
Whiskey
,
Wyoming
,
led
by
Strawberry
Alice
(
Frances
Fisher
)
,
offers
a
$
0,000
reward
to
whoever
can
kill
Quick
Mike
(
Mucci
)
and
"
Davey-Boy
"
Bunting
(
Campbell
)
,
two
cowboys
who
disfigured
Delilah
Fitzgerald
(
Levine
)
,
one
of
their
own
.

The
local
sheriff
,
Little
Bill
Daggett
(
Gene
Hackman
)
,
a
former
gunfighter
and
keeper
of
the
peace
,
is
worried
about
their
incentive
,
as
he
does
not
allow
guns
or
criminals
in
his
town
.

Little
Bill
had
given
the
two
men
leniency
,
despite
their
crime
.

Miles
away
in
Kansas
,
the
Schofield
Kid
(
Woolvett
)
,
a
boastful
young
man
,
visits
the
pig
farm
of
William
Munny
(
Eastwood
)
,
seeking
to
recruit
him
to
kill
the
cowboys
.

In
his
youth
,
Munny
was
a
bandit
notorious
as
a
cold-blooded
murderer
.

Now
a
repentant
widower
raising
two
children
,
he
has
sworn
off
alcohol
and
killing
.

Though
Munny
initially
refuses
to
help
with
the
execution
,
his
farm
is
failing
,
putting
his
children
's
future
in
jeopardy
.

Munny
reconsiders
a
few
days
later
and
sets
off
to
catch
up
with
the
Kid
.

On
his
way
,
Munny
recruits
Ned
Logan
(
Morgan
Freeman
)
,
another
retired
gunfighter
,
who
reluctantly
leaves
his
wife
(
Cardinal
)
to
go
along
.

Back
in
Wyoming
,
gunfighter
English
Bob
(
Richard
Harris
)
and
his
biographer
,
W.
W.
Beauchamp
(
Rubinek
)
,
arrive
in
Big
Whiskey
,
also
seeking
the
reward
.

Little
Bill
and
his
deputies
disarm
Bob
,
and
Bill
beats
him
savagely
,
hoping
to
discourage
other
would-be
killers
.

The
next
morning
he
ejects
Bob
from
town
,
but
Beauchamp
decides
to
stay
and
write
about
Bill
.

He
has
impressed
the
biographer
with
his
tales
of
old
gunfights
and
seeming
knowledge
of
the
inner
workings
of
a
gunfighter
's
psyche
.

Munny
,
Logan
and
the
Kid
arrive
later
during
a
rain
storm
;
they
go
to
the
saloon/whorehouse
to
discover
the
cowboys
'
location
.

With
a
bad
fever
after
riding
in
the
rain
,
Munny
is
sitting
alone
in
the
saloon
when
Little
Bill
and
his
deputies
arrive
to
confront
him
.

With
no
idea
of
Munny
's
past
,
Little
Bill
beats
him
and
kicks
him
out
of
the
saloon
after
finding
a
pistol
on
him
.

Logan
and
the
Kid
,
upstairs
getting
"
advances
"
on
their
payment
from
the
prostitutes
,
escape
out
a
back
window
.

The
three
regroup
at
a
barn
outside
of
town
,
where
they
nurse
Munny
back
to
health
.

Three
days
later
,
they
ambush
a
group
of
cowboys
and
kill
Bunting
.

Logan
and
Munny
no
longer
have
much
stomach
for
murder
.

Logan
decides
to
return
home
while
Munny
and
the
Kid
head
to
the
cowboys
'
ranch
,
where
the
Kid
ambushes
Quick
Mike
in
an
outhouse
and
kills
him
.

After
they
escape
,
a
distraught
Kid
confesses
he
had
never
killed
anyone
before
.

He
renounces
life
as
a
gunfighter
.

When
Little
Sue
(
Frederick
)
meets
the
two
men
to
give
them
the
reward
,
they
learn
that
Logan
was
captured
by
Little
Bill
's
men
and
tortured
to
death
.

He
revealed
the
names
of
his
two
accomplices
.

The
Kid
heads
back
to
Kansas
to
deliver
the
reward
money
to
Munny
and
Logan
's
families
.

Munny
drinks
half
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
heads
into
town
to
take
revenge
on
Bill
.

That
night
,
Logan
's
corpse
is
displayed
in
a
coffin
outside
the
saloon
.

Inside
,
Little
Bill
has
assembled
a
posse
to
pursue
Munny
and
the
Kid
.

Munny
walks
in
alone
and
kills
Skinny
Dubois
(
James
)
,
the
saloon
owner
and
pimp
.

After
some
tense
dialogue
,
a
gunfight
ensues
,
leaving
Bill
wounded
and
several
of
his
deputies
dead
.

Munny
orders
everyone
out
before
stopping
Little
Bill
from
reaching
for
his
pistol
.

Bill
curses
Munny
before
the
latter
finishes
him
with
a
final
gunshot
.

Munny
threatens
the
townsfolk
before
finally
leaving
town
,
warning
that
he
will
return
if
Logan
is
not
buried
properly
or
if
any
prostitutes
are
further
harmed
.

A
brief
epilogue
states
that
Munny
was
rumored
to
have
moved
to
San
Francisco
,
where
he
prospered
in
dry
goods
.

Cast
Production
The
film
was
written
by
David
Webb
Peoples
,
who
had
written
the
Oscar-nominated
film
The
Day
After
Trinity
and
co-wrote
Blade
Runner
.

The
concept
for
the
film
dated
to
0000
,
when
it
was
developed
under
the
titles
The
Cut-Whore
Killings
and
The
William
Munny
Killings
.

Eastwood
delayed
the
project
,
partly
because
he
wanted
to
wait
until
he
was
old
enough
to
play
the
lead
and
to
savor
it
as
the
last
of
his
western
films
.

At
the
time
,
some
critics
thought
this
was
to
be
Eastwood
's
last
film
as
director
and
actor
,
but
he
has
continued
in
both
roles
.

Much
of
the
cinematography
for
the
film
was
shot
in
Alberta
,
Canada
in
August
0000
by
director
of
photography
Jack
Green
.

Filming
took
place
over
00
days
between
September
and
October
0000
.

Production
designer
Henry
Bumstead
,
who
had
worked
with
Eastwood
on
High
Plains
Drifter
,
was
hired
to
create
the
"
drained
,
wintry
look
"
of
the
western
.

near-universal
acclaim
.

Many
critics
acclaimed
the
film
for
its
noir-ish
moral
ambiguity
and
atmosphere
.

They
also
acclaimed
it
as
a
fitting
eulogy
to
the
western
genre
.

Jack
Methews
of
the
Los
Angeles
Times
described
it
as
"
The
finest
classical
western
to
come
along
since
perhaps
John
Ford
's
0000
The
Searchers
.
"

Richard
Corliss
in
Time
wrote
that
the
film
was
"
Eastwood
's
meditation
on
age
,
repute
,
courage
,
heroism
–
on
all
those
burdens
he
has
been
carrying
with
such
grace
for
decades
.
"

Gene
Siskel
and
Roger
Ebert
criticized
the
work
;
though
the
latter
gave
it
a
positive
vote
,
both
criticized
the
picture
for
being
too
long
and
having
too
many
superfluous
characters
(
such
as
Harris
'
English
Bob
,
who
enters
and
leaves
without
meeting
the
protagonists
)
.

Despite
his
reservations

History
Named
for
the
Lackawaxen
River
that
flows
twelve
miles
(
00
km
)
through
the
township
,
the
European-American
settlement
in
0000
adopted
the
Lenape
name
meaning
"
swift
waters
"
.

Bands
of
both
Algonquian
-
speaking
Lenape
and
Iroquoian
-
speaking
Seneca
lived
in
the
area
through
the
early
00th
century
.

Although
neither
tribe
had
any
substantial
villages
in
the
area
,
they
used
the
land
as
hunting
grounds
.

Their
tools
,
pot
shards
and
bone
fragments
have
been
found
at
Native
American
rock
shelters
and
camp
sites
.

The
first
permanent
European
settlers
in
the
area
were
Jonathan
Conkling
and
John
Barnes
,
who
built
in
0000
.

In
the
Battle
of
Minisink
in
0000
,
00-00
European
colonial
settlers
were
killed
in
an
engagement
with
a
band
of
mostly
Iroquois
and
Loyalists
led
by
Colonel
Joseph
Brant
,
a
Mohawk
who
commanded
forces
for
the
British
.

During
the
early
part
of
the
00th
century
,
logging
was
the
principal
commercial
activity
in
the
area
.

It
produced
as
much
as
00
million
board
feet
(
000,000
m
³
)
of
lumber
annually
.

Workers
floated
logs
downriver
along
the
Delaware
to
markets
in
Easton
or
Trenton
.

In
0000
,
the
Delaware
and
Hudson
Canal
began
operating
between
Honesdale
,
Pennsylvania
and
Kingston
,
New
York
.

In
its
time
,
the
canal
company
was
the
largest
private
commercial
enterprise
in
the
nation
.

It
built
00
locks
in
Lackawaxen
Township
alone
,
raising
the
elevation
of
the
canal
.

Some
of
the
old
locks
are
still
visible
and
several
lock
houses
are
now
privately
owned
.

Roebling
's
Delaware
Aqueduct
,
built
by
John
A.
Roebling
,
famed
engineer
of
the
Brooklyn
Bridge
,
was
constructed
in
0000
as
part
of
the
canal
.

It
is
now
preserved
as
a
National
Civil
Engineering
Landmark
and
National
Historic
Landmark
by
the
National
Park
Service
(
NPS
)
.

The
canal
linked
New
York
City
with
the
rich
coal
deposits
of
the
Carbondale
,
Wilkes-Barre
and
Scranton
areas
,
providing
fuel
for
both
the
city
's
industrial
foundries
and
heating
the
expanding
number
of
residences
.

In
0000
,
the
New
York
and
Erie
Railroad
was
built
through
the
area
;
although
the
canal
continued
to
operate
for
another
fifty
years
,
railroads
eventually
made
canals
obsolete
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
railroad
brought
tourism
to
the
area
and
new
sources
of
revenue
;
the
rugged
countryside
of
the
upper
Delaware
Valley
became
a
popular
destination
for
urban
tourists
.

Stations
were
built
at
Lackawaxen
,
West
Colang
and
Mast
Hope
,
and
elaborate
resort
hotels
soon
were
developed
nearby
,
which
often
provided
guides
for
fishing
,
hiking
and
riding
in
the
area
.

Bluestone
quarrying
became
a
major
enterprise
in
the
area
starting
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

It
was
used
extensively
in
the
construction
of
the
region
's
buildings
and
sidewalks
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
western
author
Zane
Grey
lived
in
Lackawaxen
with
his
wife
and
growing
family
.

His
early
stories
related
his
experiences
of
fishing
along
the
upper
Delaware
.

Listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
is
the
Greys
'
home
from
0000
to
0000
,
now
preserved
by
the
NPS
as
a
house
museum
,
part
of
the
Upper
Delaware
Scenic
and
Recreational
River
area
.

Grey
was
buried
nearby
in

Cemetery

A
Few
Good
Men
is
a
play
by
Aaron
Sorkin
,
first
produced
on
Broadway
by
David
Brown
in
0000
.

It
tells
the
story
of
military
lawyers
at
a
court-martial
who
uncover
a
high-level
conspiracy
in
the
course
of
defending
their
clients
,
United
States
Marine
s
accused
of
murder
.

It
opened
on
Broadway
at
the
Music
Box
Theatre
in
New
York
on
November
00
,
0000
,
in
a
production
directed
by
Don
Scardino
,
with
Tom
Hulce
as
LTJG
Kaffee
,
Megan
Gallagher
as
LCDR
JoAnne
Galloway
and
Stephen
Lang
as
Col
Jessep
.

Sorkin
adapted
his
work
into
a
screenplay
for
a
0000
film
directed
by
Rob
Reiner
,
produced
by
Brown
and
starring
Tom
Cruise
,
Jack
Nicholson
,
and
Demi
Moore
.

The
film
was
nominated
for
the
Academy
Award
for
Best
Picture
,
and
the
Golden
Globe
for
Best
Screenplay
.

The
play
's
signature
catchphrase
is
"
You
ca
n't
handle
the
truth
.
"

Play
Sorkin
got
the
inspiration
for
the
play
from
a
phone
conversation
with
his
sister
Deborah
,
who
had
graduated
from
Boston
University
Law
School
and
signed
up
for
a
three-year
stint
with
the
Navy
Judge
Advocate
General
's
Corps
.

She
was
going
to
Guantanamo
Bay
Naval
Base
to
defend
a
group
of
Marines
who
came
close
to
killing
a
fellow
Marine
in
a
hazing
ordered
by
a
superior
officer
.

Sorkin
took
that
information
and
wrote
much
of
his
story
on
cocktail
napkins
while
bartending
at
the
Palace
Theatre
on
Broadway
.

Several
former
Navy
JAG
lawyers
have
been
identified
as
the
source
for
the
character
of
Lt.
Daniel
Kaffee
.

These
include
Donald
Marcari
,
David
Iglesias
,
and
Walter
Bansley
III
.

The
court
martial
was
Macari
's
first
big
court
case
.

However
in
a
September
00
,
0000
article
of
the
New
York
Times
,
Sorkin
was
quoted
saying
,
“
The
character
of
Dan
Kaffee
in
‘
A
Few
Good
Men
’
is
entirely
fictional
and
was
not
inspired
by
any
particular
individual
.

”
Once
Sorkin
completed
a
draft
,
his
theatrical
agent
sent
it
to
producer
David
Brown
who
wanted
the
film
rights
.

Sorkin
sold
Brown
the
rights
,
getting
Brown
to
agree
to
also
produce
A
Few
Good
Men
as
a
play
.

Source
material
and
legacy
The
play
is
based
on
events
which
took
place
at
Guantanamo
Bay
Naval
Base
in
July
0000
,
though
some
details
were
changed
for
dramatic
purposes
.

Members
of
Rifle
Security
Company
,
Windward
Side
,
0nd
Platoon
believed
that
one
of
their
number
,
Pfc.
William
Alvarado
,
was
a
malingerer
and
had
informed
about
a
Marine
firing
across
the
border
into
Cuba
.

In
a
retaliatory
hazing
,
or
"
Code
Red
"
,
ten
Marines
attacked
Alvarado
,
blindfolded
him
,
stuffed
a
rag
in
his
mouth
,
beat
him
and
shaved
his
head
.

Alvarado
was
seriously
injured
,
but
did
not
die
.

Of
the
ten
Marines
,
seven
accepted
other
than
honorable
discharge
s
as
part
of
a
plea
bargain
,
but
three
,
including
David
Cox
,
refused
to
accept
the
plea
bargain
and
went
to
court
.

Cox
was
defended
by
Don
Macari
;
David
Iglesias
was
also
a
member
of
the
legal
team
.

Cox
was
found
not
guilty
of
aggravated
battery
,
but
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor
charge
of
simple
assault
.

He
was
sentenced
to
time
already
served
in
the
brig
,
and
returned
to
active
duty
.

Cox
was
honorably
discharged
from
the
Marines
in
0000
.

When
he
saw
the
film
version
of
A
Few
Good
Men
,
he
was
upset
at
the
liberties
taken
with
the
event
,
most
notably
that
the
Marines
in
the
case
were
dishonorably
discharged
,
and
considered
suing
the
filmmakers
.

Cox
was
mysteriously
murdered
in
0000
.

David
Iglesias
later
became
a
United
States
Attorney
,
and
was
one
of
eight
U.S.
Attorneys
dismissed
by
the
George
W.
Bush
administration

History
The
township
was
formed
in
December
0000
from
parts
of
Milford
,
Lackawaxen
and
Westfall
Township
s
and
is
located
along
the
Delaware
River
in
Pike
County
Pennsylvania
.

Tom
Quick
Sr.
of
Milford
,
the
father
of
the
infamous
Tom
Quick
Jr.
who
built
a
cabin
on
the
south
side
of
the
Shohola
Creek
in
0000
,
was
the
first
European
to
settle
in
the
area
.

J.
W.
Johnston
who
built
a
home
nearby
in
0000
wrote
of
finding
the
remains
of
a
very
old
cabin
along
the
Shohola
Creek
.

The
Johnston
home
and
the
remains
of
the
Tom
Quick
cabin
were
buried
in
0000
with
the
construction
of
the
Erie
Railroad
.

Before
Shohola
township
was
formed
,
Shohola
Creek
divided
Lackawaxen
and
Upper
Smithfield
Townships
.

On
the
west
side
of
the
Shohola
Falls
was
an
inn
built
in
0000
by
an
Englishman
named
Samuel
Wares
called
the
Shohola
House
.

Located
at
the
intersection
of
the
Wyoming
Road
and
Milford
and
Owego
turnpike
,
it
was
the
only
hotel
and
tavern
in
the
area
until
0000
when
Tobias
Hornbeck
built
a
hotel
and
saw
mill
on
the
east
side
of
Shohola
Falls
.

The
hotel
burned
in
0000
and
the
mill
was
destroyed
by
a
flood
in
0000
despite
the
construction
of
an
intricate
system
of
dikes
to
control
the
water
into
the
mill
.

One
of
the
first
substantial
buildings
in
Shohola
Township
was
a
mill
constructed
in
0000
on
the
Shohola
Creek
where
the
Twin
Lakes
Road
bridge
is
located
today
.

The
mill
,
with
a
wooden
dam
,
was
built
by
Richard
VanZant
and
Tobias
Robinson
.

They
also
erected
a
store
,
operated
by
David
Hickock
,
located
just
east
of
the
mill
.

The
Shohola
Glen
Sawmill
remained
until
0000
and
was
used
to
hoist
the
coaches
up
Hemlock
Hill
on
the
Switchback
Gravity
Railroad
at
the
Shohola
Glen
Amusement
Park
from
0000
until
0000
.

There
was
little
additional
development
in
Shohola
until
the
arrival
of
Erie
Railroad
construction
crews
in
0000
.

The
Pond
Eddy
Bridge
and
Shohola
Glen
Hotel
are
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

Railroad
Shohola
Township
has
been
the
location
of
twelve
railroad
accidents
.

By
far
the
worst
was
the
Great
Shohola
Train
Wreck
of
the
United
States
Civil
War
on
Friday
,
July
00
,
0000
.

More
than
000
soldiers
were
killed
or
injured
in
the
accident
.

Another
accident
occurred
on
April
00
,
0000
,
at
Carr
's
Rock
killing
or
injuring
almost
000
passengers
.

The
Erie
Railroad
changed
the
name
of
the
community
of
Carr
's
Rock
to
Parker
's
Glen
after
the
accident
in
an
attempt
erase
the
tragedy
from
memory
.

E.
S.
Parker
was
a
major
stockholder
of
the
blue
stone
quarrying
business
in
the
village
.

Parker
's
Glen
was
completely
destroyed
by
flooding
of
Hurricane
Diane
in
August
0000
.

In
0000
,
an
incorrect
switch
setting
caused
the
"
Lightning
Express
"
to
leave
the
tracks
just
fifty
feet
before
the
Great
Shohola
Viaduct
.

Major
tragedy
was
averted
as
the
express
was
only
traveling
at
fifteen
miles
per
hour
.

In
0000
,
a
boulder
struck
a
freight
car
and
sent
five
cars
down
the
embankment
and
into
the
Delaware
River
at
Pond
Eddy
.

Tragedy
was
again
averted
as
the
freight
train
was
scheduled
to
run
in
place
of
a
passenger
train
that
was
delayed
.

A
second
accident
at
King
and
Fuller
's
Cut
occurred
in
0000
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
at
0:00
AM
the
citizens
of
Shohola
were
awakened
by
screams
of
agony
as
the
"
Chicago
Express
"
plowed
into
a
freight
train
.

Seventeen
cars
were
thrown
over
the
eighty
foot
embankment
into
the
Delaware
River
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
the
"
Buffalo
Express
"
,
traveling
at
00
mph
,
crashed
into
a
slow
moving
freight
train
.

The
sleeping
cars
caught
fire
and
debris
was
everywhere
.

Other
accidents
occurred
in
0000
and
0000
at
Shohola
,
0000
at
Pond
Eddy
,
0000
at
Handsome
Eddy
and
0000
at
Parker
's
Glen
.

The
0000
accident
spilled
three
boxcars
loaded
with
sifted
flour
.

Some
of
the
flour
dumped
into
Twin
Lakes
Creek
and
the
Delaware
River
creating
a
thick
paste
.

A
railroad
caboose
was
placed
in
Shohola
to
commemorate
the
Robert
E.
Peary
expeditions
to
the
North
Pole
.

In
0000
,
Eben
Thomas
,
President
of
the
Erie
Railroad
presented
Peary
with
a
caboose
to
be
use
as
living
quarters
for
his
expeditions
.

Erie
caboose
0000
was
placed
on
the
deck
of
the
steamship
Windward
which
Peary
used
as
his
headquarters
for
many
journeys
to
explore
the
northland
.

In
July
0000
,
the
caboose
was
returned
to
the
Erie
Railroad
and
brought
to
Shohola
to
attract
visitors
to
the
area
and
the
amusement
park
.

It
was
decorated
with
scenes
of
the
Arctic
region
and
was
popular
with
visitors
.

Plot
The
story
takes
place
in
Edwardian
Britain
.

Three
families
represent
three
social
classes
:
the
Wilcoxes
are
wealthy
capitalists
,
the
class
that
is
displacing
the
aristocracy
;
the
Schlegel
sisters
represent
the
enlightened
bourgeoisie
;
and
the
Basts
are
in
the
lower
middle
class
.

(
Forster
is
clear
that
the
novel
is
"
not
concerned
with
the
very
poor
"
.
)

The
film
asks
the
question
"
"
Who
will
inherit
England
?
"

and
answers
it
through
the
ownership
of
the
house
,
Howards
End
,
as
it
passes
from
person
to
person
.

At
the
start
of
the
film
,
the
younger
sister
,
Helen
Schlegel
(
Helena
Bonham
Carter
)
,
rashly
becomes
engaged
to
the
younger
Wilcox
son
,
Paul
.

The
next
day
both
realise
their
mistake
and
break
it
off
,
but
Helen
has
told
her
older
sister
,
who
tells
her
family
.

Her
Aunt
Juley
(
Prunella
Scales
)
arrives
at
Howards
End
and
so
makes
the
Wilcox
family
aware
of
the
engagement
.

Later
,
when
the
Wilcox
family
takes
a
house
near
to
the
Schlegels
in
London
,
the
sister
,
Margaret
Schlegel
(
Emma
Thompson
)
,
feels
compelled
to
visit
because
of
the
social
embarrassment
of
the
previous
year
.

She
befriends
the
mother
,
Ruth
Wilcox
(
Vanessa
Redgrave
)
.

Ruth
is
descended
from
English
yeoman
stock
and
it
is
through
her
family
that
the
Wilcoxes
own
Howards
End
,
a
house
which
she
loves
dearly
and
which
is
the
symbol
of
rural
the
United
Kingdom
and
British
tradition
.

Over
the
course
of
a
few
months
,
the
two
women
become
close
friends
,
and
Ruth
sees
in
Margaret
a
kindred
spirit
.

Hearing
that
the
lease
on
the
Schlegels
'
London
house
is
due
to
expire
,
and
knowing
she
is
soon
to
die
,
Ruth
bequeaths
Howards
End
to
Margaret
.

This
causes
great
consternation
for
the
Wilcoxes
,
who
refuse
to
believe
that
Ruth
was
in
her
"
right
mind
"
or
intended
her
home
to
go
to
a
relative
stranger
.

The
Wilcoxes
burn
the
piece
of
paper
that
Ruth
's
bequest
is
written
on
,
and
decide
to
keep
her
will
secret
.

Because
he
knows
that
he
has
prevented
the
Schlegels
from
finding
a
home
in
Howards
End
,
Henry
Wilcox
(
Anthony
Hopkins
)
offers
to
help
Margaret
find
a
new
place
to
live
.

As
a
result
,
the
two
become
close
and
Henry
proposes
.

The
Schlegels
befriend
a
young
,
poor
,
yet
intellectual
clerk
,
Leonard
Bast
(
Samuel
West
)
.

Wishing
to
improve
his
lot
,
they
pass
along
advice
from
Henry
that
Leonard
should
leave
his
post
because
his
company
is
heading
for
a
crash
.

Leonard
does
so
,
but
finds
himself
in
a
worse
position
and
eventually
unemployed
.

The
two
plotlines
converge
at
the
marriage
party
of
Evie
Wilcox
(
daughter
of
Henry
and
Ruth
)
.

Helen
has
found
the
Basts
starving
and
brings
them
to
the
party
.

Jacky
Bast
(
Nicola
Duffett
)
becomes
drunk
;
Margaret
approaches
her
with
Henry
to
find
out
who
she
is
.

Jacky
recognises
Henry
and
it
becomes
clear
that
years
previously
he
had
had
an
affair
with
her
.

Humiliated
and
suspicious
,
Henry
breaks
off
the
engagement
,
but
that
evening
he
and
Margaret
reconcile
and
she
forgives
his
sexual
impropriety
.

In
accordance
with
Henry
's
wishes
,
she
insists
that
Helen
take
the
Basts
away
and
refuses
them
help
.

Because
of
this
,
the
Schlegel
sisters
drift
apart
.

Helen
has
a
brief
affair
with
Leonard
Bast
.

She
becomes
pregnant
,
and
leaves
the
country
,
telling
none
of
her
condition
.

When
Helen
returns
to
take
her
possessions
,
she
asks
if
she
can
stay
one
night
at
Howards
End
.

When
Henry
Wilcox
finds
out
that
Helen
is
pregnant
,
he
insists
that
she
can
not
stay
in
the
house
,
and
that
the
man
responsible
must
be
found
out
and
punished
for
dishonouring
her
.

Margaret
and
Henry
argue
bitterly
about
the
different
standards
of
sexual
propriety
applied
to
men
and
women
,
and
Margaret
says
she
is
leaving
Henry
.

Margaret
,
Leonard
and
the
oldest
Wilcox
son
Charles
(
James
Wilby
)
all
make
their
way
separately
to
Howards
End
and
the
final
tragedy
unfolds
:
Charles
attacks
and
inadvertently
kills
Leonard
,
and
is
arrested
.

Henry
's
pride
is
shaken
;
his
feelings
break
through
at
last
,
and
he
and
Margaret
become
truly
close
.

Ultimately
,
Ruth
Wilcox
's
wish
is
fulfilled
:
Henry
leaves
Howards
End
to
Margaret
upon
his
death
.

Helen
is
reconciled
with
Margaret
,
and
Helen
will
raise
her
son
as
heir
.

In
both
film
and
novel
,
the
final
ownership
of
Howards
End
is
a
symbol
of
new
class
relations
in
Britain
:
the
wealth
of
the
new
industrialists
(
the
Wilcoxes
)
married
to
the
politically
reforming
vision
of
liberalism
(
the
Schlegels
)
that
will
benefit
the
children
of
the
lower
classes
(
the
Basts
)
.

They
pay
an
uninvited
surprise
visit
to
Slade
's
brother
's
home

time
the
reason
behind
Slade
's
blindness
is
also
revealed
.

As
they
return
to
New
York
,
Charlie
tells
Slade
about
his
complications
at
school
.

Slade
advises
Charlie
to
inform
on
his
classmates
and
go
to
Harvard
,
warning
him
that
George
will
probably
be
pressured
into
not
maintaining
silence
.

Later
at
a
restaurant
,
Slade
is
aware
of
Donna
;
a
young
woman
waiting
for
her
date
.

Although
blind
,
Slade
leads
Donna
in
a
spectacular
tango
(
"
Por
una
Cabeza
"
)
on
the
dance
floor
.

That
night
,
he
hires
a
female
escort
.

Deeply
despondent
the
next
morning
,
Slade
responds
to
Charlie
's
suggestion
that
they
test
drive
a
Ferrari
.

Charlie
lets
Slade
drive
the
car
and
Slade
begins
speeding
,
attracting
the
attention
of
a
police
officer
(
Ron
Eldard
)
,
whom
Slade
manages
to
appease
without
giving
away
his
blindness
.

When
they
return
to
the
hotel
,
Slade
sends
Charlie
out
on
a
list
of
errands
.

Charlie
initially
leaves
the
room
but
quickly
becomes
suspicious
.

Charlie
returns
to
find
Slade
in
his
military
uniform
,
preparing
to
commit
suicide
with
a
gun
from
which
Charlie
had
made
Slade
promise
to
remove
the
bullets
earlier
,
regarding
which
Slade
states
"
I
lied
"
.

Charlie
intervenes
and
attempts
to
grab
Slade
's
gun
.

Slade
,
however
,
easily
overpowers
him
,
threatening
to
shoot
Charlie
before
himself
.

They
enter
a
tense
argument
,
with
both
struggling
for
the
gun
;
however
,
after
Charlie
bravely
calms
Slade
,
he
backs
down
.

The
two
return
to
New
England
.

At
school
,
Charlie
and
George
are
subjected
to
a
formal
inquiry
in
front
of
the
student
body
and
the
student/faculty
disciplinary
committee
.

As
headmaster
Trask
is
opening
the
proceedings
,
Slade
unexpectedly
returns
to
the
school
,
joining
Charlie
on
the
auditorium
stage
for
support
.

For
his
defense
,
George
has
enlisted
the
help
of
his
wealthy
father
,
and
divulges
the
names
of
the
perpetrators
,
qualifying
that
his
vision
was
n't
clear
.

When
pressed
for
more
details
,
George
passes
the
burden
to
Charlie
.

Although
struggling
with
his
decision
,
Charlie
gives
no
information
,
so
Trask
recommends
Charlie
's
expulsion
.

At
this
,
Slade
can
not
contain
himself
and
launches
into
a
passionate
speech
defending
Charlie
and
questioning
the
integrity
of
a
system
that
rewards
informing
on
classmates
.

He
tells
them
that
Charlie
has
shown
integrity
in
his
actions
and
for
the
committee
to
not
expel
him
because
this
is
what
great
leaders
are
made
of
and
he
will
make
them
proud
in
the
future
.

The
disciplinary
committee
decides
to
place
on
probation
the
students
named
by
George
,
and
to
give
George
neither
recognition
nor
commendation
for
his
testimony
.

They
excuse
Charlie
from
any
punishment
and
allow
him
to
have
no
further
say
in
the
inquiries
,
to
loud
applause
from
the
student
body
.

As
Charlie
escorts
Slade
to
his
limo
,
a
female
political
science
teacher
,
Christine
Downes
,
who
was
part
of
the
disciplinary
committee
approaches
Slade
,
commending
him
for
his
speech
.

Seeing
a
spark
between
them
,
Charlie
tells
Ms.
Downes
that
Slade
served
on
President
Lyndon
Johnson
's
staff
.

A
romantic
prospect
is
hinted
between
Slade
and
Ms.
Downes
as
they
part
ways
.

Charlie
takes
Slade
home
,
where
they
go
their
separate
ways
.

The
colonel
walks
towards
his
house
and
greets
his
niece
's
young
children
happily
as
Charlie
watches
by
the
limo
.

Frackville
is
a
borough
in
Schuylkill
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Frackville
is
located
near
the
intersection
of
Interstate
00
and
Pennsylvania
State
Route
00
,
approximately
northeast
of
Harrisburg
and
southwest
of
Wilkes-Barre
.

History
Frackville
was
settled
in
0000
and
incorporated
in
0000
,
when
the
village
s
of
Frackville
and
Mountain
City
merged
to
form
the
borough
of
Frackville
.

The
name
"
Mountain
City
"
,
however
,
is
still
a
common
nickname
for
the
borough
.

A
past
diner
and
beer
distributor
were
both
named
after
it
.

Early
in
the
twentieth
century
,
anthracite
coal
mining
was
the
chief
industry
of
the
region
,
although
Frackville
remained
a
predominantly
residential
community
.

The
Mahanoy
Plane
,
which
operated
from
0000
–
0000
on
Broad
Mountain
just
to
the
north
of
the
borough
,
was
able
to
hoist
00,000
tons
of
coal
daily
.

There
is
a
small
patch-town
owning
the
name
"
Mahanoy
Plane
"
at
the
northern
foot
of
Frackville
's
Broad
Mountain
.

Industrial
relics
and
infrastructure
remain
in
the
thick
forest
north
of
the
borough
's
youth
baseball
complex
but
historical
preservation
or
restoration
has
yet
to
take
place
.

Frackville
celebrated
its
centennial
in
0000
while
James
Nahas
was
mayor
.

It
was
a
week
long
event
from
August
00
–
00
which
hosted
parades
each
night
and
brought
the
community
closer
together
.

The
borough
's
000th
anniversary
celebration
was
held
in
0000
and
had
similar
events

effects
.

It
culminated
with
a
Frackville
Cruise
Night
that
had
routes
running

the
borough
.

Frackville
sits
in
the

's
historic
Coal
Region
,
about
0
miles
south

Coal
mining
has
largely
ceased
in
the
area
.

Coal
mining
was
never
actually
done
in
Frackville
itself
;
it
was
,
however
,
a
source
of
transporting
the
coal
through
the
now-defunct
railroad
companies
.

Many
of
Frackville
's
residents
are
employed
at
local
factories
,
retail
outlets
,
and
the
numerous
Pennsylvania
State
Prisons
in
the
immediate
area
.

Many
more
commute
daily
to
the
cities
of
Pottsville
,
Hazleton
,
Allentown
,
Reading
or
Harrisburg
to
work
.

Frackville
is
indeed
surrounded
by
many
prisons
.

Frackville
Museum
In
0000
,
Lorraine
Stanton
began
interviewing
the
elderly
citizens
of
Frackville
in
preparation
for
the
town
’s
0000
Centennial
.

The
result
of
her
research
and
interviews
during
that
period
are
found
in
the
Old
Frackville
Tales
--
articles
printed
in
the
Shenandoah
Evening
Herald
newspaper
from
0000
until
the
culminating
Centennial
Edition
in
August
0000
.

The
Tales
can
be
found
at
the
State
Library
in
Harrisburg
.

However
,
her
interest
in
promoting
the
town
’s
history
lingered
long
after
the
Centennial
.

She
continued
collecting
articles
about
and
pictures
of
the
town
and
its
residents
,
as
well
as
artifacts
reflecting
life
during
the
years
following
our
town
’s
incorporation
.

She
envisioned
a
central
home
for
her
collection
of
files
and
pictures
,
in
addition
to
those
items
given
to
her
by
other
people
over
the
years
.

When
the
Frackville
Borough
Council
agreed
to
give
space
in
the
new
Borough
Complex
and
acquire
her
collection
,
the
vision
became
a
reality
.

The
Frackville
Museum
welcomes
the
donation
of
any
items
relevant
to
the
town
,
such
as
small
collectibles
,
local
school
memorabilia
,
Frackville
souvenirs
,
or
business
items
from
years
gone
by
.

History
The
earliest
available
history
shows
[
0
]
that
in
0000
the
entire
Heckscherville
valley
was
composed
of
two
villages
.

At
this
time
the
valley
was
called
“
Chapmanville
”
after
the
owners
of
the
coal
mines
.

In
0000
the
Chapmanville
interests
were
taken
over
by
George
and
William
Payne
.

Subsequently
the
valley
’s
name
was
changed
to
“
Payne
’s
Patch
”
.

With
coal
sales
increasing
,
the
Payne
brothers
found
it
necessary
to
secure
additional
laborers
.

Taking
advantage
of
the
famine
in
Ireland
in
0000
,
they
traveled
to
Ireland
to
persuade
hundreds
of
families
and
individuals
to
move
to
America
.

The
Payne
brothers
focused
on
the
Queens
and
Kilkenney
counties
,
and
provided
transportation
,
employment
and
homes
to
those
who
agreed
to
move
.

Before
the
brothers
returned
to
Payne
’s
Patch
,
the
valley
was
populated
almost
entirely
by
Welsh
with
only
a
few
scattered
Irish
families
.

However
,
when
they
did
return
with
the
Irish
immigrants
,
the
Welsh
started
to
migrate
elsewhere
and
the
population
changed
to
dominantly
Irish
.

This
influx
of
immigrants
continued
until
almost
the
entire
population
was
either
Irish
or
of
Irish
descent
.

Because
of
this
,
the
small
valley
then
became
known
as
the
“
Irish
Valley
”
[

]
.

In
0000
the
August
Heckscher
family
from
New
York
acquired
the
Payne
brothers
holding
,
and
changed
the
name
to
Heckscherville
.

Years
later
the
population
began
to
undergo
another
change
.

The
coal
companies
,
due
to
a
manpower
shortage
,
began
to
bring
into
the
region
laborers
from
various
countries
in
Europe
.

Nationalities
included
:
Polish
,
Lithuanians
,
Slavs
,
and
Greeks
.

Today
nearly
every
nationality
is
represented
in
the
eight
miles
of
the
Heckscherville
Valley

Saint
Kierans
Church
Saint
Keirans
is
a
Roman
Catholic
church
located
in
Heckscherville
Pennsylvania
.

It
is
the
sole
church
in
the
town
and
was
built
by
Irish
miners
in
the
0000s
under
the
direction
of
John
Neumann
.

Neumann
was
the
first
United

Bishop
to
be
made
a
saint
.

St.
Kieran
's
is
the
only
church
whose
construction
the
Bishop
personally
oversaw
on
0
separate
visits
to
the
site
.

Architecturally
designed
after
the
tiny
country
church
at
Knock
,
Ireland
(
which
became
famous
when
the
miraculous
apparition
of
Our
Lady
of
Knock
appeared
there
in

,
St.
Kieran
's
was
rumored
to
be
one
of
Bishop
Neumann
's
favored
parishes

The

is
a
casualty
in

Synopsis
Gerry
Conlon
(
Daniel
Day-Lewis
)
is
shown
in
Belfast
stripping
lead
from
roofs
of
houses
when
the
security
forces
home
in
on
the
district
with
armoured
cars
,
and
the
dustbin
lids
beat
out
a
riot
.

Although
worried
that
the
IRA
will
punish
him
for
causing
a
riot
,
they
reveal
to
his
father
that
they
are
merely
scaring
him
so
he
does
not
repeat
the
crime
.

He
is
then
sent
off
to
London
by
his
parents
to
keep
him
out
of
trouble
.

There
he
finds
a
squat
,
to
explore
,
as
he
puts
it
,
"
free
love
and
dope
.
"

The
evening
when
he
walks
off
with
some
money
from
a
prostitute
's
flat
is
when
an
explosion
at
a
pub
in
Guildford
kills
five
people
(
four
soldiers
and
a
civilian
)
and
wounds
00
.

Conlon
returns
to
Belfast
to
share
his
fortune
.

His
family
home
is
raided
by
the
British
Army
and
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
who
arrest
him
,
and
immediately
place
him
on
a
military
flight
to
the
mainland
UK
.

Gerry
and
his
friend
are
interrogated
by
police
who
torture
and
threaten
them
until
both
finally
agree
to
sign
a
confession
after
being
held
for
up
to
seven
days
under
the
Prevention
of
Terrorism
Act
.

When
his
father
Giuseppe
traveled
from
Belfast
to
help
his
son
,
he
was
arrested
at
the
family
's
relatives
'
home
in
England
.

In
the
subsequent
trial
,
his
aunt
's
family
(
known
as
the
Maguire
Seven
,
including
his
father
)
are
convicted
of
supporting
the
bombing
on
the
basis
of
unsubstantiated
nitroglycerin
traces
,
and
the
four
,
including
Gerry
,
are
sentenced
to
long
terms
of
imprisonment
.

His
time
in
prison
shows
a
progression
from
a
bitter
son
who
rails
at
his
father
to
an
awakening
when
he
discovers
the
real
perpetrator
of
the
bombing
in
the
same
facility
.

When
this
man
leads
a
prison
protest
and
then
sets
a
hated
prison
guard
on
fire
,
Gerry
is
the
one
who
saves
the
man
with
a
blanket
.

Gerry
takes
over
the
fight
for
justice
himself
when
his
father
dies
in
custody
.

Gareth
Peirce
,
a
campaigning
lawyer
(
Emma
Thompson
)
who
has
been
investigating
the
case
on
behalf
of
Giuseppe
in
the
wake
of
public
campaigns
demanding
the
release
of
the
accused
,
has
a
break
when
she
tries
to
access
his
father
's
file
and
is
able
to
look
instead
at
Gerry
's
.

She
finds
vital
police
documents
in
the
file
are
marked
"
Not
to
be
shown
to
the
Defence
"
.

During
the
course
of
their
appeal
,
the
production
of
these
documents
leads
to
a
triumphant
scene
in
court
when
Peirce
produces
the
evidence
that
the
police
officers
have
been
lying
all
the
way
through
,
which
leads
to
the
exoneration
and
release
of
all
the
Four
.

The
film
ends
with
a
triumphant
Gerry
telling
his
story
to
the
media
and
vowing
to
clear
his
late
father
's
name
.

Thunder
Road
is
a
0000
drama
–
crime
film
about
running
moonshine
in
the
mountains
of
Kentucky
and
Tennessee
in
the
late
0000s
.

It
was
directed
by
Arthur
Ripley
and
starred
Robert
Mitchum
,
who
also
produced
the
film
,
co-wrote
the
screenplay
,
and
is
rumored
to
have
directed
much
of
the
film
himself
.

He
also
co-wrote
(
with
Don
Raye
)
the
theme
song
,
"
The
Ballad
of
Thunder
Road
"
.

The
film
became
a
cult
classic
and
continued
to
play
at
drive-in
movie
theater
s
in
some
Southeastern
markets
through
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Plot
Korean
War
veteran
Lucas
Doolin
(
Robert
Mitchum
)
works
in
the
family
moonshine
business
—
delivering
the
illegal
liquor
his
father
distills
to
clandestine
distribution
points
throughout
the
south
in
his
souped-up
hot
rod
.

However
,
Lucas
has
more
problems
than
evading
the
U.S.
Treasury
agents
(
"
revenooers
"
)
,
led
by
determined
newcomer
Troy
Barrett
(
Gene
Barry
)
.

Lucas
is
concerned
that
his
younger
brother
Robin
(
James
Mitchum
)
,
who
is
also
his
mechanic
,
will
be
tempted
into
following
in
his
footsteps
and
becoming
a
moonshine
runner
.

A
well-funded
outside
gangster
,
Carl
Kogan
(
Jacques
Aubuchon
)
,
tries
to
gain
control
of
the
independent
local
moonshine
producers
and
their
distribution
points
,
and
is
willing
to
kill
anyone
who
stands
in
his
way
.

The
stakes
rise
when
an
attempt
by
Kogan
to
kill
Lucas
results
in
the
death
of
a
government
agent
as
well
as
another
moonshine
driver
.

In
a
romantic
subplot
,
Lucas
becomes
involved
with
nightclub
singer
Francie
Wymore
(
Keely
Smith
)
.

He
is
unaware
one
of
the
neighbor
girls
,
Roxanna
Ledbetter
(
Sandra
Knight
)
,
has
a
crush
on
him
and
fears
for
his
life
.

When
a
series
of
government
raids
destroy
their
hidden
stills
,
Lucas
'
father
and
the
other
local
moonshines
shut
down
production
"
for
a
spell
"
to
let
the
government
deal
with
Kogan
in
its
own
time
,
but
Lucas
is
forced
by
circumstances
and
his
own
code
of
honor
to
make
a
final
run
.

Factual
background
The
film
was
based
loosely
on
an
incident
in
which
a
driver
transporting
moonshine
was
said
to
have
crashed
to
his
death
on
Kingston
Pike
in
Knoxville
,
Tennessee
between
Bearden
Hill
and
Morrell
Road
.

Per
Metro
Pulse
writer
Jack
Renfro
,
the
incident
occurred
in
0000
and
may
have
been
witnessed
by
James
Agee
,
who
passed
the
story
on
to
Mitchum
.

Cast
Role
of
Robin
Doolin
The
role
of
Robin
Doolin
,
Lucas
's
younger
brother
,
was
originally
written
for
Elvis
Presley
per
Mitchum
's
request
.

Mitchum
personally
submitted
the
script
to
Elvis
in
Los
Angeles
.

The
singer
was
eager
to
play
the
role
,
but
his
manager
,
Colonel
Tom
Parker
,
in
order
to
maintain
his
extravagant
lifestyle
,
stepped
in
and
demanded
Elvis
be
paid
an
enormous
sum
of
money
,
more
than
the
entire
budget
for
the
movie
,
which
ended
negotiations
.

Mitchum
's
son
James
got
the
part
,
which
worked
well
due
to
the
close
physical
resemblance
.

Production
In
the
film
,
Mitchum
drove
a
souped-up
0000
Ford
0-door
sedan
hot-rod
with
a
custom
tank
in
the
back
for
moonshine
and
later
a
0000
Ford
coupe
with
the
same
alterations
.

The
'00
Ford
was
modified
with
a
'00
hood
and
grill
and
the
rear
taillight
trim
was
removed
.

The
film
's
dialogue
refers
to
the
car
as
a
'
00
,
but
it
is
not
,
although
at
least
one
exterior
shot
,
when
the
car
spills
oil
on
the
road
,
is
of
the
trunk
of
a
'
00
.

Most
of
the
scenes
were
filmed
in
Asheville
,
North
Carolina
Highway
00
and
others
at
Lake
Lure
.

Some
scenes
were
filmed
in
Beech
,
east
of
Weaverville
.

Scenes
include
Reems
Creek
Road
,
Sugar
Creek
Road
and
the
Beech
Community
Center
.

Some
scenes
were
actual
local
moonshine
drivers
shot
with
a
camera
mounted
on
a
pickup
tailgate
.

The
stunt
coordinator
was
Cary
Loftin
.

The
stunt
team
included
Ray
Austin
,
Neil
Castes
Sr.
,
Robert
Hoy
and
Dale
Van
Sickel
.

The
movie
's
theme
song
,
"
The
Ballad
of
Thunder
Road
"
,
was
later
recorded
by
Mitchum
and
became
a
popular
single
record
,
although
Mitchum
's
rendition
is
not
the
one
in
the
film
itself
.

Springsteen

at

census

History
In
the
year
0000
,
a
settler
by
the
name
of
Thomas
Reed
traveled
through
the
valley
between
the
Thomaston
Mountains
and
the
Gap
Rocks
.

At
this
junction
,
several
mountain
streams
converged
where
this
settler
built
a
log
cabin
and
a
sawmill
on
the
west
Branch
of
the
Schuylkill
River
,
just
below
the
mouth
of
Wolf
Creek
.

Shortly
thereafter
,
he
built
a
tavern
on
the
South
Side
of
the
Sunbury
Trail
on
the
present
site
of
the
Saint
Vincent
DePaul
's
Church
.

This
tavern
was
referred
to
as
the
"
Half
Way
House
"
,
because
it
was
half-way
between
Reading
and
Sunbury
.

The
Sunbury
Trail
was
the
first
road
through
Schuylkill
County
and
was
known
as
the
Kings
Highway
which
was
authorized
by
the
Crown
of
England
,
King
George
III
in
0000
.

The
early
settlers
engaged
in
timbering
as
their
first
livelihood
,
but
experienced
difficulty
in
transporting
the
heavy
logs
out
of
the
valley
.

The
rough
timber
was
floated
by
raft
to
Schuylkill
Haven
to
the
Schuylkill
Canal
and
on
to
Reading
where
it
was
sold
or
traded
for
other
products
.

Necho
Allen
discovered
coal
in
0000
,
but
it
was
not
until
0000
that
any
actual
mining
took
place
.

Dr.
McFarland
,
a
scientist
,
opened
a
vein
at
York
Farm
near
Pottsville
.

Later
,
in
0000
,
Jacob
Reed
,
son
the
of
original
founder
,
opened
another
vein
in
the
Minersville
Area
.

The
completion
of
the
Schuylkill
Haven
and
Mine
Hill
Railroad
provided
the
means
to
transport
the
coal
produced
in
the
region
.

The
development
of
the
coal
industry
grew
rapidly
and
attracted
many
immigrants
.

Experienced
English
and
Welsh
miners
arrived
first
from
their
home
lands
.

Next
arrivals
were
the
Germans
and
Irishman
,
soon
to
be
followed
by
many
other
ethnic
groups
that
make
up
the
community
.

The
influx
of
inhabitants
to
the
community
promoted
the
need
to
begin
municipal
planning
.

Titus
Bennett
laid
out
the
town
in

on
parts
of
two
tracts
of
land
patented
to
Lawrence
Lewis
and
Robert
M.
Lewis
on
July

,
at
that
time
part
of
Branch
Township
.

On
May
0
,
0000
,
Minersville
citizens
held
an
election
at
the
home
of
David
Buckwater
for
the
purpose
of
electing
a
Burgess
.

Samuel
Richert
was
elected
to
this
position
,
as
well
as
the
following
men
who
served
on
the
first
Council
:
John
Provst
,
John
Patrick
,
Dr.
Anthony
Steinberger
,
John
L.
Swaine
,
John
B.
Hahn
,
David
Buckwater
and
Daniel
R.
Bennet
.

The
first
president
of

Town
Council
was
Daniel
R.
Bennet
;
first
treasurer
,
Thomas
J.
Harman
,
Clerk
,
and
Milligan
G.
Gable
,
High
Constable
.

Minersville
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
April

,
0000
by
Act
of
the
legislature
approved
by
Governor
George
Wolf
.

Minersville
School
District
was
involved
in
a
nation
court
case
gaining
much
attention
;
Minersville
School
District
v.
Gobitis
,
0000
.

This
case
dealt
with
a
family
whose
children
would
not
salute
the
flag
or
recite
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
(
they
were
Jehovah
's
Witnesses
)
.

This
case
would
put
Minersville
"
on
the
map
,
"
as
it
reached
all
the
way
to
the
Supreme
Court
.

The
final
verdict
was
that
the
school
district
could
,
in
fact
,
make
students
stand
,
salute
,
and
recite
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
.

This
decision
came
under
much
scrutiny
and
would
not
stay
long
,
as
it
would
be
overturned
shortly
thereafter
.

History
New
Philadelphia
had
historically
been
an
anthracite
mining
town
.

The
first
coal-burning
furnace
was
invented
in
0000
by
Eliphalet
Nott
in
Valley
Furnace
,
a
section
of
New
Philadelphia
on
the
northeast
end
of
town
and
is
still
standing
today
.

Because
of
the
high
number
of
Lithuanians
and
Irish
in
the
area
,
there
was
much
separation
of
the
two
nationalities
.

This
tension
ultimately
resulted
in
the
forming
of
two
separate
Catholic
churches
;
Sacred
Heart
(
Lithuanian
)
and
Holy
Family
(
Irish
)
.

There
was
also
a
town-wide
brawl
that
occurred
as
a
result
of
this
tension
.

The
dispute
was
settled
by
the
priests
from
Sacred
Heart
and
Holy
Family
calling
their
respective
patrons
to
stop
fighting
and
buying
each
other
a
beer
.

In
0000
,
the
two
Catholic
parishes
were
merged
to
create
Holy
Cross
Roman
Catholic
Church
.

In
0000
,
the
Souls
Harvest
Baptist
Church
relocated
to
New
Philadelphia
from
Port
Carbon
,
Pennsylvania
.

They
are
now
located
at
the
corner
of
Kimber
and
Clay
streets
in
the
building
that
once
housed
a
Methodist
church
.

This
building
is
the
oldest

Plot
summary
The
Piano
tells
the
story
of
a
mute
Scotswoman
,
Ada
McGrath
(
Holly
Hunter
)
,
whose
father
sells
her
into
marriage
to
a
New
Zealand
frontiersman
,
Alistair
Stewart
(
Sam
Neill
)
.

She
is
shipped
off
along
with
her
young
daughter
Flora
McGrath
(
Anna
Paquin
)
.

The
voice
that
the
audience
hears
is
not
her
speaking
voice
,
but
her
mind
's
voice
.

Ada
has
not
spoken
a
word
since
she
was
six
years
old
,
expressing
herself
instead
through
her
piano
playing
and
through
sign
language
for
which
her
daughter
has
served
as
the
interpreter
.

Ada
cares
little
for
the
mundane
world
,
occupying
herself
for
hours
every
day
with
the
piano
.

It
is
never
made
explicitly
clear
why
she
ceased
to
speak
.

Flora
,
it
is
later
learned
,
is
the
product
of
a
relationship
with
a
teacher
whom
Ada
believed
she
could
control
with
her
mind
,
making
him
love
her
,
but
who
"
became
frightened
and
stopped
listening
,
"
and
thus
left
her
.

Ada
,
Flora
,
and
their
belongings
,
including
the
piano
,
are
deposited
on
a
New
Zealand
beach
by
the
ship
's
crew
against
her
angry
objections
.

As
there
is
no
one
there
to
meet
them
,
they
spend
the
night
alone
,
sheltering
under
a
tiny
tent
made
of
a
hoop
skirt
frame
.

The
following
day
,
Alistair
arrives
with
a
Māori
crew
and
his
friend
Baines
(
Harvey
Keitel
)
,
a
fellow
forester
and
a
retired
sailor
,
who
has
adopted
many
of
the
Māori
customs
,
including
tattooing
his
face
and
socializing
with
the
Māori
instead
of
his
own
race
(
save
Alistair
)
.

There
are
insufficient
men
to
carry
everything
and
Alistair
abandons
the
piano
,
again
eliciting
objections
from
Ada
.

Alistair
proves
to
be
a
shy
and
diffident
man
,
who
is
jokingly
called
"
old
dry
balls
"
by
his
Māori
cohorts
.

He
tells
Ada
that
there
is
no
room
in
his
small
house
for
the
piano
.

Ada
,
in
turn
,
makes
no
effort
to
befriend
him
and
continues
to
try
to
be
reunited
with
her
piano
.

Unable
to
communicate
with
Alistair
,
she
goes
,
with
Flora
,
to
Baines
and
asks
to
be
taken
to
the
piano
.

He
agrees
,
and
the
three
spend
the
day
as
she
plays
tunes
on
the
beach
.

While
he
socially
aligns
himself
with
the
Māori
,
Baines
has
steadfastly
refused
any
sexual
activity
with
Māori
women
.

But
he
clearly
finds
Ada
attractive
due
to
her
passion
for
music
.

Baines
eventually
retrieves
the
instrument
and
suggests
that
Alistair
trade
it
and
lessons
from
Ada
for
some
land
that
Alistair
wants
.

Alistair
consents
,
oblivious
to
the
budding
attraction
between
Ada
and
Baines
.

She
is
surprised
to
find
that
he
has
had
the
piano
put
into
perfect
tune
after
its
rough
journey
.

He
asks
to
simply
listen
rather
than
learn
to
play
himself
,
and
then
offers
to
let
her
buy
the
piano
back
,
one
key
at
a
time
,
by
letting
him
do
"
things
he
likes
"
while
she
plays
.

Ada
reluctantly
agrees
,
as
she
is
attracted
to
Baines
.

Ada
and
Alistair
have
had
no
sexual
,
or
even
mildly
affectionate
,
interaction
even
though
they
are
betrothed
to
marry
.

Baines
is
sexually
aroused
by
Ada
's
playing
to
the
point
that
he
openly
approaches
her
.

Finally
,
she
yields
to
her
own
desire
one
afternoon
,
and
she
and
Baines
have
intercourse
.

Alistair
finally
begins
to
suspect
the
love
affair
and
after
discovering
them
,
he
angrily
boards
up
his
home
with
Ada
inside
when
he
goes
off
to
work
on
his
timberland
.

After
that
interlude
,
Ada
avoids
Baines
and
feigns
affection
with
Alistair
,
though
her
caresses
only
serve
to
frustrate
him
more
because
when
he
makes
a
move
to
touch
her
in
return
,
she
pulls
away
.

Before
Alistair
departs
on
his
next
journey
,
he
asks
Ada
if
she
will
go
to
see
Baines
she
shakes
her
head
no
and
he
says
he
will
trust
her
word
while
he
's
gone
.

Soon
after
,
Ada
sends
her
daughter
with
a
package
for
Baines
,
containing
a
single
piano
key
with
an
inscribed
love
declaration
that
says
"
Dear
George
you
have
my
heart
Ada
McGrath
"
.

Flora
has
begun
to
accept
Alistair
as
her
"
papa
"
and
is
angered
by
her
mother
's
infidelity
.

She
brings
the
piano
key
instead
to
Alistair
.

After
reading
the
love
note
burnt
onto
the
piano
key
,
Alistair
furiously
returns
home
and
cuts
off
Ada
's
index
finger
with
an
axe
to
deprive
her
of
the
ability
to
play
her
piano
.

He
then
sends
Flora
to
Baines
with
the
severed
finger
wrapped
in
cloth
,
with
the
message
that
if
Baines
ever
attempts
to
see
Ada
again
,
he
will
chop
off
more
fingers
.

After
Ada
recovers
from
her
injury
,
Alistair
sends
her
and
Flora
away
with
Baines
and
dissolves
their
marriage
.

They
depart
from
the
same
beach
on
which
she
first
landed
in
New
Zealand
.

While
being
rowed
to
the
ship
with
her
baggage
and
the
piano
tied
onto
a
Maori
longboat
,
Ada
insists
that
Baines
throw
the
piano
overboard
.

As
it
sinks
,
she
deliberately
tangles
her
foot
in
the
rope
trailing
after
it
.

She
is
pulled
overboard
but
,
deep
underwater
,
changes
her
mind
and
kicks
free
and
is
pulled
to
safety
.

In
an
epilogue
,
Ada
describes
her
new
life
with
Baines
and
Flora
in
Nelson
,
where
she
has
started
to
give
piano
lessons
in
their
new
home
,
and
her
severed
finger
has
been
replaced
with
a
silver
finger
made
by
Baines
.

Ada
says
that
she
imagines
her
piano
in
its
grave
in
the
sea
,
and
herself
suspended
above
it
,
which
"
lulls
me
to
sleep
.
"

Ada
has
also
started
to
take
speech
lessons
in
order
to
learn
how
to
speak
again
.

The
film
closes
with
the
Thomas
Hood
quote
,
from
his
poem
"
Silence
,
"
which
also
opened
the
film
:
"
There
is
a
silence
where
hath
been
no
sound
.

There
is
a
silence
where
no
sound
may
be
in
the
cold
grave
under
the
deep
deep
sea
.
"

Cast
Production
Casting
the
role
of
Ada
was
a
difficult
process
.

Sigourney
Weaver
was
Campion
's
first
choice
,
but
she
turned
down
the
role
because
she
was
taking
a
break
from
film
at
the
time
.

Jennifer
Jason
Leigh
was
also
considered
but
she
could
n't
meet
with
Campion
to
read
the
script
because
she
was
committed
to
shooting
the
film
Rush
.

Isabelle
Huppert
met
with
Jane
Campion
and
had
vintage
period-style
photographs
taken
of
her
as
Ada
,
and
later
said
she
regretted
not
fighting
for
the
role
as
Hunter
did
.

The
casting
for
Flora
occurred
after
Hunter
had
been
selected
for
the
part
.

They
did
a
series
of
open
auditions
for
girls
age
0
to
00
,
focusing
on
girls
who
were
small
enough
to
be
believable
as
Ada
's
daughter
(
as
Holly
Hunter
is
a
rather
short
actress
at

'
0
"
)
.

Alistair
Fox
has
argued
that
The
Piano
was
significantly
influenced
by
Jane
Mander
's
The
Story
of
a
New
Zealand
River
.

Robert
Macklin
,
an
associate
editor
with
The
Canberra
Times
newspaper
,
has
also
written
about
the
similarities
.

The
movie
also
serves
as
a
retelling
of
the
fairytale
Bluebeard
,
which
is
hinted
at
further
in
the
inclusion
of
Bluebeard
as
a
piece
of
the
Christmas
pageant
.

not
just
about
a
story

some
characters
,
but
about
a
whole
universe
of
feeling

Pottsville
is
a
city
in
,
and
the
county
seat
of
Schuylkill
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population

at
the
0000
census
,
and
is
the
principal
city
of
the
Pottsville
,
PA
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
city
lies
along
the
west
bank
of
the
Schuylkill
River
,
north-west
of
Philadelphia
.

It
is
located
in
Pennsylvania
's
Coal
Region
,
named
for
the
abundance
of
anthracite
coal
.

History
Early
settlement
By
the
Charter
of
Charles
II
,
by
the
grace
of
God
,
King
of
England
,
Scotland
,
Ireland
,
and
France
,
Defender
of
the
Faith
,
to
his
trustie
and
well
beloved
subject
,
William
Penn
,
Esq.
,
sonne
and
heire
of
Sir
William
Penn
,
for
the
Colony
of
Pennsylvania
,
the
grantee
,
William
Penn
,
was
given
power
and
authority
to
erect
counties
,
in
the
following
words
:
"
And
we
do
further
for
us
,
our
heires
and
successors
,
give
and
grant
unto
the
said
William
Penn
,
his
heirs
and
assignees
,
free
and
absolute
power
to
divide
the
said
countrey
and
islands
into
townes
,
into
boroughes
and
counties
,
etc.
,
"
whereupon
William
Penn
did
divide
the
Province
into
three
counties
,
Philadelphia
,
Bucks
and
Chester
.

The
last
comprised
all
lands
west
and
south
of
the
Delaware
and
the
Schuylkill
;
therefore
the
site
of
Pottsville
was
originally
in
Chester
County
.

When
the
legislative
Council
,
on
00
May
0000
,
enacted
the
law
erecting
Lancaster
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
which
included
all
the
lands
of
the
Province
lying
westward
of
a
straight
line
drawn
northeasterly
from
the
headwaters
of
Octorara
Creek
(
near
the
southern
borders
)
marked
with
blazed
trees
,
to
the
Schuylkill
River
,
then
this
placed
Pottsville
in
Lancaster
County
.

By
enactment
of
the
same
Council
,
approved
on
00
March
0000
,
Berks
County
was
erected
;
this
placed
Pottsville
within
the
limits
of
that
county
.

Pottsville
's
anthracite
coal
history
began
in
0000
when
it
was
discovered
by
hunter
Necho
Allen
.

Legend
has
it
that
Allen
fell
asleep
at
the
base
of
the
Broad
Mountain
,
and
woke
to
the
sight
of
a
large
fire
;
his
campfire
had
ignited
an
outcropping
of
coal
.

By
0000
an
anthracite-fired
iron
furnace
was
established
on
the
Schuylkill
River
.

00th
century
In
0000
John
Pott
purchased
the
furnace
.

By
an
act
of
Assembly
of
the
Commonwealth
approved
March
0
,
0000
,
the
County
of
Schuylkill
was
erected
out
of
portions
of
Berks
and
Northampton
;
this
placed
the
site
of
Pottsville
in
Schuylkill
County
.

The
town
was
formally
laid
out
in
0000
by
a
local
surveyor
,
Henry
Donnell
.

Pottsville
was
established
as
a
village
in
Norwegian
Township
in
0000
and
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
February
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
D.G.
Yuengling
&
Son
established
the
oldest
operated
family
beer
brewery
in
the
United
States
.

In
0000
Pottsville
became
the
county
seat
,
the
original
county
seat
being
Orwigsburg
.

The
Philadelphia
and
Reading
Coal
and
Iron
Company
,
which
has
its
roots
in
the
Philadelphia
and
Reading
Railway
Company
,
the
remnants
of
which
were
acquired
in
the
late
00th
century
by
the
Reading
Anthracite
Company
,
acquired
extentive
coal
lands
and
would
become
one
of
the
most
notable
of
the
coal
companies
operating
in
Pennsylvania
until
the
demise
of
the
anthracite
industry
after
World
War
II
.

Because
of
its
location
along
the
Schuylkill
River
,
Pottsville
developed
a
small
textile
industry
.

Out
of
this
industry
grew
the
Phillips
Van
Heusen
company
which
was
founded
in
0000
.

Moses
Phillips
and
his
wife
Endel
began
sewing
shirts
by
hand
and
selling
them
from
pushcarts
to
the
local
coal
miners
.

Van
Heusen
and
other
textile
companies
left
the
region
starting
in
the
late
0000s
,
mainly
as
a
result
of
foreign
competition
.

Another
element
of
the
textile
industry
was
the
Tilt
Silk
Mill
on
Twelfth
Street
,
which
produced
silk
from
silk
worms
imported
from
China
which
fed
on
mulberry
trees
in
the
building
's
solarium
.

The
silk
business
eventually
was
eclipsed
by
the
development
of
nylon
stockings
.

The
building
still
stands
and
is
presently
the
headquarters
of
a
storage
and
vehicle
rental
business
.

00th
century
During
the
Prohibition
period
in
the
United
States
,
under
the
00th
Amendment
,
Yuengling
stopped
making
beer
and
moved
to
production
of
"
near
beer
"
.

The
three
brews
produced
in
this
time
were
the
Yuengling
Special
(
the
most
popular
brand
)
,
Yuengling
Por-Tor
(
a
version
of
their
"
celebrated
Pottsville
Porter
"
)
,
and
finally
,
the
Yuengling
Juvo
,
which
was
a
cereal
beverage
.

Then-owner
Frank
Yuengling
also
opened
the
Yuengling
Dairy
,
which
produced
ice
cream
and
other
dairy
products
for
the
local
area
.

These
ventures
helped
to
keep
the
company
afloat
during
that
period
.

When
the
00th
Amendment
was
repealed
,
Yuengling
stopped
production
of
"
near
beer
"
and
resumed
making
alcoholic
beverages
.

The
brewery
famously
sent
a
truckload
of
its
Winner
Beer
to
the
White
House
in
0000
as
thanks
to
President
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
for
the
repeal
of
Prohibition
.

Yuengling
still
continues
its
family-owned
business
today
.

It
is
the
second
largest
American-owned
brewery
,
after
the
Boston
Beer
Company
,
producer
of
Samuel
Adams
beer
.

The
Yuengling
Dairy
was
operated
by
a
different
branch
of
the
family
from
the
Brewery
.

Business
declined
and
the
dairy
folded
as
of
0000
.

Attempted
buyouts
by
large
conglomerate
breweries
have
all
been
unsuccessful
.

Pottsville
was
chartered
as
a
third-class
city
on
March
00
,
0000
.

Pottsville
was
host
to
a
National
Football
League
(
NFL
)
franchise
from
0000-0000
.

The
Pottsville
Maroons
played
in
Sportsman
's
Park
(
or
Minersville
Park
)
in
nearby
Minersville
,
now
the
site
of
King
's
Village
shopping
plaza
.

The
Maroons
posted
some
of
the
best
records
in
the
NFL
during
the
0000
and
0000
seasons
.

The
Maroons
had
a
claim
to
the
0000
NFL
championship
,
but
because
of
a
controversial
decision
by
NFL
President
Joe
Carr
,
the
title
was
instead
awarded
to
the
Chicago
Cardinals
.

The
Maroons
suffered
two
more
losing
seasons
before
relocating
to
Boston
and
becoming
the
Boston
Bulldogs
.

The
Bulldogs
folded
in
0000
.

Until
the
middle
of
the
00th
century
,
Pottsville
was
a
popular
destination
for
many
traveling
acts
and
vaudeville
performers
.

The
0000
film
Berth
Marks
stars
the
comedy
legends
Laurel
and
Hardy
as
they
attempt
to
reach
Pottsville
by
train
for
one
of
their
booked
performances
.

Pearl
Bailey
had
once
resided
in
Pottsville
during
the
early
part
of
her
entertaining
career
.

Soldiers
in
training
at
nearby
Fort
Indiantown
Gap
were
prohibited
from
visiting
Pottsville
during
most
of
World
War
II
due
to
the
large
amounts
of
illicit
venues
and
activities
present
during
the
time
.

In
August
0000
,
the
Pottsville
Railway
Park
Little
League
all
star
team
,
managed
by
00-year
veteran
Irv
Shappell
,
made
an
impressive
run
to
the
Little
League
World
Series
in
Williamsport
,
Pennsylvania
by
representing
the
U.S.
East
Region
.

The
team
glided
through
the
Pennsylvania
District
00
Tournament
including
defeating
their
cross-town
rival
Pottsville
Rotary
Little
League
00-0
.

Following
the
District
00
Tournament
Railway
Park
continued
its
impressive
run
through
the
PA
Section
0
Tournament
beating
every
team
they
played
.

Moving
on
to
the
Pennsylvania
State
Tournament
which
was
held
in
Carbondale
,
PA
;
they
suffered
their
first
loss
of
the
tournament
to
Berwyn-Paoli
Little
League
only
to
bounce
back
the
next
night
to
win
the
State
Crown
which
earned
them
a
berth
in
the
U.S.
Eastern
Region
Tournament
in
Bristol
,
Connecticut
.

Defeating
Connecticut
twice
,
as
well
as
teams
from
Rhode
Island
,
Maine
,
and
New
Jersey
they
played
their
final
game
before
the
Series
against
California-Hollywood
,
Maryland
,
defeating
them
0-0
in
a
LIVE-televised
game
on
ESPN0
.

Finally
,
in
Williamsport
for
the
World
Series
they
defeated
Dyer
,
Indiana
0-0
in
an
extra
inning
game
.

The
following
evening
they
played
Bradenton
,
Florida
at
Lamade
Stadium
before
the
largest
crowd
ever
to
watch
a
Non-championship
game
.

The
crowd
was
estimated
at
more
than
00,000
.

Although
they
lost
the
game
they
played
their
final
game
against
Mission
Viejo
,
Southern
California
,
losing
to
that
team
0-0
;
one
game
shy
of
the
United
States
Championship
Game
.

The
team
returned
home
to
a
city-wide
party
and
more
than
000
fire
trucks
welcomed
them
back
to
town
.

00st
century
Today
Pottsville
is
on
the
verge
of
revitalizing
the
downtown
area
.

The
city
completed
in
0000
a
streetscaping
project
on

Shenandoah
is
a
small
town
located
in
the
lower
part
of
the
anthracite
Coal
Region
,
Schuylkill
County
,
Pennsylvania
.

It
is
northwest
of
Philadelphia
.

The
Greater
Shenandoah
area
includes
Shenandoah
Heights
,
which
is
part
of
West
Mahanoy
Township
and
is
located
just
north
of
Shenandoah
.

History
The
area
that
became
Shenandoah
was
first
settled
by
a
farmer
named
Peter
Kehley
in
0000
.

He
sold
his
claim
to
the
Philadelphia
Land
Company
,
which
in
anticipation
of
the
opening
of
coal
mines
in
the
area
,
laid
out
the
town
in
0000
.

Booming
growth
occurred
during
the
Civil
War
years
caused
by
the
development
and
opening
of
several
anthracite
coal
mine
s.
The
area
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
and
was
a
famous
hotbed
of
activity
during
the
era
of
the
Molly
Maguires
in
the
0000s
.

After
the
original
influx
of
English
,
Welsh
,
Irish
,
and
German
immigrants
a
large
influx
of
peoples
from
the
eastern
and
southern
European
countries
occurred
in
the
decades
before
and
after
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
.

By
0000
,
the
town
had
a
population
of
nearly
00,000
residents
.

The
community
was
hard
hit
by
the
decline
of
the
anthracite
coal
industry
after
World
War
II
and
heavy
emigration
by
coal
miners
occurred
in
order
to
find
work
elsewhere
.

In
Schuylkill
County
Court
,
January
0000
,
those
interested
filed
their
petition
for
retail
,
wholesale
,
bottling
or
brewing
licenses
at
the
Office
of
the
Clerk
of
the
Court
.

Shenandoah
was
represented
with
bars
and
breweries
.

This
coal
town
offered
more
bars
per
thousand
people
than
any
other
location
in
the
world
.

The
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
Station
served
as
the
main
passenger
terminal
in
Shenandoah
,
but
because
of
the
coal
industry
,
it
was
not
the
only
railroad
to
service
Shenandoah
.

The
town
was
also
served
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
and
Reading
Railroad
,
making
Shenandoah
the
only
borough
in
Pennsylvania
to
be
served
by
three
railroad
companies
.

During
the
Great
Coal
Strike
of
0000
the
Pennsylvania
National
Guard
was
called
into
Shenandoah
to
keep
the
peace
and
curb
rioting
by
angry
miners
.

The
strike
would
only
be
resolved
after
President
Theodore
Roosevelt
intervened
.

Origins
of
the
name
The
origin
of
the
name
Shenandoah
is
much
debated
.

One
theory
holds
that
Shenandoah
received
its
name
from
an
Indian
word
meaning
'
sprucy
stream
'
or
'
river
flowing
alongside
high
hills
and
mountains
'
.

Another
origin
theory
is
that
the
town
was
named
after
the
Shenandoah
Valley
in
Virginia
.

The
Virginia
valley
in
turn
took
its
name
from
an
Iroquoian
word
meaning
'
deer
'
.

History
Tamaqua
was
founded
in
0000
by
German
immigrant
Burkhardt
Moser
.

Originally
to
be
named
Tuscarora
,
the
name
Tamaqua
was
chosen
after
it
was
realized
that
there
already
was
a
community
named
Tuscarora
about
four
miles
(
0
km
)
to
the
west
.

Roughly
half
of
Moser
's
original
log
cabin
is
still
intact
and
visible
behind
a
house
on
the
east
side
of
Broad
Street
.

The
discovery
of
anthracite
coal
in
the
region
in
the
early
00th
century
led
to
the
town
's
rise
as
a
coal
producing
community
.

The
town
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

German
,
Irish
,
and
Welsh
immigrants
came
to
the
borough
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
followed
by
a
large
influx
of
Italians
,
Lithuanians
,
Slovaks
,
and
Poles
in
the
0000s
and
early
00th
century
.

During
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
Tamaqua
was
the
geographic
center
hub
for
the
Molly
Maguires
.

One
murder
commonly
attributed
to
the
Mollies
was
that
of
town
policeman
Benjamin
Yost
,
who
was
shot
to
death
early
one
morning
while
extinguishing
a
gas
lamp
at
the
corner
of
West
Broad
and
Lehigh
Streets
.

The
Tamaqua
Railroad
Station
was
constructed
in
0000
.

Arguably
Tamaqua
's
most
famous
landmark
,
it
stood
idle
from
the
mid
00s
through
the
late
00s
after
passenger
railroad
service
to
the
town
was
discontinued
.

Initially
planned
to
be
demolished
in
the
late
0000s
,
the
non-profit
group
Save
Our
Station
(
S.O.S.
)
eventually
managed
to
raise
enough
money
to
have
it
refurbished
at
a
cost
of
$
0.0
million
.

The
station
reopened
in
August
0000
,
now
home
to
a
full-service
restaurant
and
gift
shop
.

Rail
excursions
leave
from
there
during
the
Tamaqua
Historical
Society
's
annual
Heritage
Festival
on
the
second
Sunday
in
October
.

Tamaqua
remained
a
thriving
community
throughout
the
heyday
of
coal
production
in
the
United
States
in
the
late
00th
century
and
early
00th
century
.

Certain
sections
of
the
borough
,
such
as
Dutch
Hill
and
the
South
Ward
,
had
a
reputation
for
"
toughness
"
;
those
sections
were
also
densely
populated
by
immigrants
from
southern
and
eastern
Europe
.

However
,
it
began
declining
,
along
with
many
other
anthracite
communities
,
in
the
0000s
as
coal
mines
began
tapering
off
.

Hurricane
Diane
caused
tremendous
damage
to
Tamaqua
's
railroad
yards
to
the
extent
that
they
never
fully
recovered
.

In
0000
the
borough
annexed
neighboring
Rahn
Township
and
its
Owl
Creek
section
,
home
to
the
world
's
first
fish
hatchery
.

In
0000
John
E.
Morgan
established
a
knitwear
manufacturing
industry
in
Tamaqua
.

The
company
,
Morgan
Knitting
Mills
,
Inc
,
grew
into
one
of
the
largest
employers
in
the
area
,
second
only
to
the
Atlas
Powder
Company
.

In
the
mid
0000s
,
Morgan
,
working
from
a
design
developed
by
his
wife
(
Anna
Hoban
Morgan
)
patented
the
widely
known
Thermal
Underwear
product
lines
.

Since
Morgan
's
death
in
0000
,
the
Morgan
Trust
has
donated
money
to
various
worthwhile
causes
in
Tamaqua
.

The
Morgan
Trust
also
established
the
John
&
Dorothy
Morgan
Cancer
Center
at
the
Lehigh
Valley
Hospital
.

In
the
fiction
of
John
O'Hara
,
a
product
of
nearby
Pottsville
,
Tamaqua
appears
as
"
Taqua

"

Dial

Legal
precedent
The
borough
of
Tamaqua
passed
an
unprecedented
law
giving
ecosystems
legal
rights
.

The
ordinance
establishes
that
the
municipal
government
or
any
Tamaqua
resident
can
file
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
the
local
ecosystem
.

Other

The
Remains
of

is
Kazuo
Ishiguro
's
third
published
novel
.

The
work
was
awarded
the
Man
Booker
Prize
for
Fiction
in
0000
.

A
film
adaptation
of
the
novel
,
made
in
0000
and
starring
Anthony
Hopkins
and
Emma
Thompson
,
was
nominated
for
eight
Academy
Award
s.
As
in
Ishiguro
's
two
previous
novels
,
the
story
is
told
from
a
first
person
point
of
view
.

The
narrator
,
Stevens
,
a
butler
,
recalls
his
life
in
the
form
of
a
diary
while
the
action
progresses
through
the
present
.

Much
of
the
novel
is
concerned
with
Stevens
'
professional
and
,
above
all
,
personal
relationship
with
a
former
colleague
,
the
housekeeper
Miss
Kenton
.

Plot
summary
The
Remains
of
the
Day
tells
,
in
first
person
,
the
story
of
Stevens
,
an
English
butler
who
has
dedicated
his
life
to
the
loyal
service
of
Lord
Darlington
(
mentioned
in
increasing
detail
in
flashbacks
)
.

The
novel
begins
with
Stevens
receiving
a
letter
from
a
former
colleague
,
Miss
Kenton
,
describing
her
married
life
,
which
he
believes
hints
at
an
unhappy
marriage
.

The
receipt
of
the
letter
coincides
with
Stevens
having
the
opportunity
to
revisit
this
once-cherished
relationship
,
if
only
under
the
guise
of
investigating
the
possibility
of
re-employment
.

Stevens
's
new
employer
,
a
wealthy
American
named
Mr
Farraday
,
encourages
Stevens
to
borrow
his
car
to
take
a
well-earned
break
,
a
"
motoring
trip
"
.

As
he
sets
out
,
Stevens
has
the
opportunity
to
reflect
on
his
immutable
loyalty
to
Lord
Darlington
,
on
the
meaning
of
the
term
"
dignity
"
,
and
even
on
his
relationship
with
his
own
late
father
.

Ultimately
Stevens
is
forced
to
ponder
the
true
nature
of
his
relationship
with
Miss
Kenton
.

As
the
book
progresses
,
increasing
evidence
of
Miss
Kenton
's
one-time
love
for
Stevens
,
and
of
his
for
her
,
is
revealed
.

Working
together
during
the
years
leading
up
to
the
Second
World
War
,
Stevens
and
Miss
Kenton
fail
to
admit
their
true
feelings
towards
each
other
.

All
of
their
recollected
conversations
show
a
professional
friendship
which
at
times
came
close
to
crossing
the
line
into
romance
,
but
never
dared
to
do
so
.

Miss
Kenton
,
it
later
emerges
,
has
been
married
for
over
00
years
and
therefore
is
no
longer
Miss
Kenton
but
has
become
Mrs
Benn
.

She
admits
to
wondering
occasionally
what
a
life
with
Stevens
might
have
been
like
,
but
she
has
come
to
love
her
husband
and
is
looking
forward
to
the
birth
of
their
first
grandchild
.

Stevens
muses
over
lost
opportunities
,
both
with
Miss
Kenton
and
with
his
long-time
employer
,
Lord
Darlington
.

At
the
end
of
the
novel
,
Stevens
instead
focuses
on
the
"
remains
of
[
his
]
day
"
,
referring
to
his
future
service
with
Mr
Farraday
.

Characters
in
The
Remains
of
the
Day
On
his
motoring
trip
,
Stevens
briefly
comes
into
contact
with
several
other
characters
.

They
are
mirrors
to
Stevens
and
show
the
reader
different
facets
of
his
character
;
they
are
also
all
kind
and
try
to
help
him
.

Two
in
particular
,
Dr.
Carlisle
and
Harry
Smith
,
highlight
themes
in
the
book
.

Themes
Dignity
The
most
important
aspect
of
Stevens
's
life
is
his
dignity
as
an
English
butler
.

Such
aspects
of
refined
dignity
,
especially
when
applied
under
stressful
situations
,
are
,
to
Stevens
,
what
define
a
"
great
butler
"
.

As
such
,
Stevens
constantly
maintains
an
inward
and
outward
sense
of
dignity
in
order
to
preserve
his
own
identity
.

These
philosophies
of
dignity
,
however
,
greatly
affect
his
life
—
largely
with
respect
to
social
constraints
,
loyalty
and
politics
,
and
love
and
relationships
.

By
preserving
dignity
at
the
expense
of
such
emotions
,
Stevens
in
a
way
loses
his
sense
of
humanity
with
respect
to
his
own
personal
self
.

Stevens
's
primary
struggle
within
the
novel
is
how
his
dignity
relates
to
his
own
experiences
,
as
well
as
the
role
his
dignity
plays
in
the
past
,
present
,
and
future
.

Banter
Banter
is
a
central
and
underlying
theme
in
the
novel
.

Stevens
introduces
it
in
the
prologue
as
a
problem
which
he
considers
his
duty
to
solve
in
order
to
please
Mr
Farraday
.

Stevens
takes
this
new
duty
very
seriously
.

He
ponders
over
it
,
practices
in
his
room
,
and
studies
a
radio
programme
called
"
Twice
a
Week
or
More
"
for
its
witticisms
.

He
practises
banter
on
the
people
he
meets
,
such
as
the
locals
in
the
Coach
and
Horses
inn
near
Taunton
,
but
is
unsuccessful
.

He
agonizes
over
it
yet
fails
to
realise
that
it
is
his
delivery
that
is
lacking
.

The
true
significance
of
banter
becomes
apparent
at
the
end
of
the
novel
when
Stevens
has
met
the
retired
butler
who
strikes
up
a
conversation
with
him
and
tells
him
to
enjoy
his
old
age
.

Stevens
then
listens
to
the
chatter
of
the
people
around
him
,
in
a
positive
frame
of
mind
,
and
realises
that
banter
is
"
the
key
to
human
warmth
"
.

Social
constraints
The
novel
does
not
present
the
situation
of
Stevens
as
simply
a
personal
one
.

It
seems
clear
that
Stevens
's
position
as
butler
,
and
servant
,
has
gradually
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
live
a
fulfilling
emotional
life
.

His
father
dies
,
and
Stevens
is
too
occupied
with
worrying
about
whether
his
butlering
is
being
carried
out
correctly
to
mourn
(
something
that
he
later
reflects
on
with
great
pride
)
.

Stevens
too
can
not
bring
himself
to
express
feelings
about
personal
matters
,
as
expressing
such
emotions
would
compromise
his
dignity
.

The
social
rules
at
the
time
were
certainly
a
major
constraint
.

As
we
see
in
the
book
,
servants
who
wish
to
get
married
and
have
children
immediately
find
themselves
without
a
job
,
since
married
life
is
seen
as
incompatible
with
total
devotion
to
one
's
master
.

A
truly
"
great
butler
"
does
not
abandon
his
profession
,
and
,
as
such
,
Stevens
feels
that
such
choices
are
foolish
in
regard
to
the
life
of
a
butler
.

Loyalty
and
politics
Stevens
is
shown
as
totally
loyal
to
Lord
Darlington
,
whose
friendly
approach
towards
Germany
,
through
his
friendship
to
Mrs
Charles
Barnet
,
also
results
in
close
contacts
to
right-wing
extremist
organizations
,
such
as
the
Blackshirts
of
Sir
Oswald
Mosley
.

Due
to
this
,
he
also
discharges
the
two
Jewish
staff
members
(
which
he
regretted
later
as
a
mistake
)
.

He
also
had
contact
with
British
and
German
diplomats
.

In
"
day
four
-
afternoon
"
a
meeting
is
described
between
the
Prime
Minister
and
German
Ambassador
Ribbentrop
in
the
rooms
of
his
estate
.

Stevens
is
quite
incapable
of
believing
his
master
to
be
wrong
in
this
,
as
Lord
Darlington
's
upbringing
and
heritage
carry
a
certain
type
of
dignity
that
is
ascended
above
and
beyond
Stevens
'
own
.

Love
and
relationships
Stevens
is
arguably
aware
on
some
level
of
Miss
Kenton
's
feelings
,
but
he
fails
to
reciprocate
.

Miss
Kenton
's
actions
often
leave
Stevens
bemused
and
puzzled
,
but
his
recollections
reveal
to
the
reader
the
lost
possibilities
of
their
relationship
,
as
past
interactions
are
recreated
.

However
,
Stevens
is
never
able
to
acknowledge
the
complexity
of
feeling
he
possesses
for
Miss
Kenton
,
insisting
only
that
they
shared
an
'
excellent
professional
relationship
'
.

It
is
not
only
the
constraints
of
his
social
situation
,
but
also
his
own
emotional
maturity
(
or
immaturity
)
that
holds
him
back
.

During
their
time
spent
at
Darlington
Hall
,
Stevens
chose
to
maintain
a
sense
of
distance
born
from
his
personal
understanding
of
dignity
,
as
opposed
to
searching
and
discovering
the
feelings
that
existed
between
himself
and
Miss
Kenton
.

It
is
only
within
their
final
encounter
that
Stevens
tragically
becomes
aware
of
the
lost
potential
of
his
life
with
Miss
Kenton
.

Memory
and
perspective
In
common
with
his
other
novels
,
Ishiguro
uses
the
structural
devices
of
memory
and
perspective
within
this
novel
.

Past
events
are
presented
from
the
view
point
of
the
main
protagonist
,
the
aging
Stevens
;
elements
of
the
past
are
presented
as
fragments
,
apparently
subconsciously
censored
by
Stevens
in
order
to
present
(
explicitly
)
a
description
of
past
occurrences
as
he
would
have
the
reader
understand
them
and
(
implicitly
)
in
order
to
relay
the
fact
that
the
information
supplied
is
subjective
.

On
occasion
the
narrator
acknowledges
the
potential
inaccuracy
of
his
recollections
and
this
serves
the
reader
by
inviting
him
to
question
the
pedigree
of
the
information
relayed
by
Stevens
;
the
more
the
reader
learns
about
Stevens
’s
character
,
the
more
we
are
able
to
interpret
the
sub-textual
intention
of
the
fragments
of
memory
presented
by
him
.

This
device
serves
to
engage
the
reader
who
is
invited
to
look
beneath
the
facts
of
the
incidents
in
question
and
provides
a
clever
literary
device
for
looking
beyond
the
public
face
presented
by
a
character
whose
very
essence
is
characterised
by
the
presentation
of
a
dignified
façade
.

Allusions
to
real
life
events
The
theme
of
the
decline
of
the
British
aristocracy
can
be
linked
to
the
0000
Parliament
Act
,
which
reduced
their
power
,
and
to
inheritance
tax
increases
imposed
after
World
War
I
,
which
forced
the
break-up
of
many
estates
that
had
been
passed
down
for
generations
.

The
pro-German
stance
of
Lord
Darlington
has
parallels
in
the
warm
relations
with
Germany
favoured
by
some
British
aristocrats
in
the
early
0000s
,
such
as
Lord
Londonderry
.

History
Founding
Tower
City
was
founded
by
and
named
for
Charlemagne
Tower
,
a
New
York
–
born
lawyer
who
had
come
to
Schuylkill
County
,
Pennsylvania
in
0000
to
work
with
the
legal
issues
regarding
land
claims
to
large
coal
and
mineral
deposits
in
that
area
.

His
first
Pennsylvania
practice
was
located
in
Orwigsburg
,
and
then
relocated
to
Pottsville
in
0000
when
it
was
made
the
Schyulkill
County
seat
.

Not
long
after
Tower
came
to
Pottsville
,
he
began
furiously
purchasing
and
clearing
liens
to
lands
containing
large
anthracite
deposits
in
and
around
Schuylkill
County
.

This
was
part
of
an
elaborate
land
grab
scheme
devised
by
Tower
and
his
partner
,
Alfred
Munson
of
Utica
,
NY
.

The
plan
called
for
Tower
to
use
his
legal
acumen
to
clear
all
the
liens
and
opposing
claims
to
the
Munson-Williams
claim
,
and
to
all
the
land
around
it
.

In
short
,
the
partners
hoped
to
create
a
single
landed
estate
,
which
would
have
measured
00
miles
by
0
½
miles
(
000
km
by
0
km
)
at
its
widest
point
in
southwest
Schuylkill
County
.

In
return
,
Tower
was
to
receive
ownership
and
title
to
one
half
of
all
the
land
acquired
once
all
the
cost
to
Munson
had
been
settled
,
or
until
Tower
paid
him
half
the
value
of
the
total
land
purchase
.

At
the
time
,
the
Schuylkill
Valley
was
a
hotly
contested
property
,
with
constant
conflicts
over
titles
and
rights
.

Had
any
of
their
competitors
became
aware
of
what
Tower
and
Munson
were
up
to
,
they
may
well
have
bought
up
the
land
the
pair
were
after
,
and
charged
exorbitant
prices
for
it
.

Or
worse
,
refuse
to
sell
it
at
all
.

Thus
,
they
chose
to
operate
in
secret
.

Tower
would
make
the
purchases
,
and
convey
the
titles
to
legal
dummies
to
hide
the
actual
ownership
of
the
land
.

By
0000
Tower
and
Munson
were
owners
of
eleven
thousand
acres
(
00
km
²
)
.

By
now
,
Munson
and
Tower
's
plan
was
well
out
of
the
bag
,
and
anyone
who
had
even
a
partial
claim
to
any
of
the
lands
began
to
litigate
.

Only
Tower
's
considerable
skill
as
a
lawyer
kept
the
whole
enterprise
from
falling
apart
.

In
0000
,
Tower
decided
to
start
selling
the
lands
,
wanting
to
realize
his
interest
in
them
.

Unfortunately
,
he
could
not
find
a
buyer
at
the
time
due
to
the
title
issues
.

Deciding
instead
to
establish
collieries
on
the
land
,
in
March
0000
he
leased
(
0
km
²
)
to
two
independent
coal
companies
.

It
was
a
00
year
term
,
with
a
rental
of
$
.00
for
each
ton
of
coal
mined
.

The
companies
placed
two
collieries
on
the
land
,
the
Tower
(
Later
known
as
East
Brookside
)
and
the
Brookside
.

Near
the
collieries
,
Tower
began
to
develop
a
small
town
,
which
was
named
Tower
City
when
first
surveyed
.

Tower
laid
out
the
town
,
and
rented
lots
to
settlers
.

The
town
was
up
and
running
by
mid-0000
,
and
immediately
suffered
a
housing
shortage
.

After
these
initial
growing
pains
,
the
town
grew
steadily
due
to
the
collieries
,
and
was
officially
incorporated
on
December
00
,
0000
as
a
borough
of
Porter
Township
,
Schuylkill
County
.

The
coal
industry
The
Brookside
was
established
in
0000
,
and
administered
by
Williams
,
Jones
,
Savage
,
and
W.B.
Kaufman
.

This
group
held
the
colliery
until
0000
,
and
then
sold
it
to
Repplier
&
Company
,
which
held
it
until
0000
.

During
the
early
0000s
,
Franklin
Gowen
,
President
of
the
Reading
Railroad
,
had
begun
purchasing
coal
lands
along
the
Railroad
's
right-of-way
for
the
express
purpose
of
building
an
anthracite
coal
monopoly
.

By
0000
,
Gowen
had
accumulated
(
000
km
²
)
,
and
Tower
accepted
his
offer
of
purchase
for
his
lands
.

Tower
asked
for
and
received
$
0
million
from
Gowen
,
for
which
Tower
realized
a
profit
of
$
0.0
million
as
per
the
original
contract
with
the
Munson
family
.

(
Alfred
Munson
died
in
May
0000
.
)

Later
that
year
,
the
Philadelphia
&
Reading
Coal
&
Iron
Company
(
a
company
set
up
by
the
Philadelphia
&
Reading
Railroad
to
administer
their
anthracite
properties
)
came
into
possession
of
the
Brookside
through
its
purchase
of
the
Munson
and
Williams
lands
.

When
closed
in
0000
,
the
colliery
had
produced
a
total
of
00,000,000
tons
of
coal
over
its
lifetime
.

The
original
owners
of
the
Tower
colliery
were
E.D.
and
James
Savage
,
Evans
,
and
Althouse
.

They
operated
the
colliery
from
0000
to
0000
,
when
it
was
purchased
by
Repplier
,
Gordon
&
Company
.

The
colliery
was
in
service
until
0000
,
then
abandoned
.

The
total
production
of
the
Tower
colliery
to
0000
was
000,000
tons
of
coal
.

The
Philadelphia
&
Reading
Coal
&
Iron
Company
reopened
the
colliery
in
0000
and
renamed
it
the
East
Brookside
.

It
was
jointly
operated
with
the
Brookside
,
now
known
as
the
West
Brookside
.

Rail
service
Tower
City
's
emerging
coal
industry
was
initially
serviced
by
the
Good
Spring
Railroad
,
which
built
an
extension
from
Donaldson
to
the
Brookside
in
0000
.

The
Good
Spring
was
initially
controlled
by
the
Reading
Railroad
,
but
transferred
to
the
property
of
the
Swatara
Railroad
in
0000
.

The
Good
Spring
was
then
consolidated
along
with
several
other
area
railroads
to
form
the
Lebanon
and
Tremont
Railroad
in
March
0000
,
and
was
reacquired
by
and
merged
into
the
Reading
about
a
month
later
.

In
this
new
arrangement
,
the
former
Good
Spring
line
was
retitled
as
the
Brookside
Branch
,
and
ran
from
the
Brookside
Collery
to
Tremont
,
where
it
met
the
Lebanon
and
Tremont
Branch
.

The
Williams
Valley
Railroad
began
operations
in
0000
,
which
extended
further
from
the
Brookside
branch
into
the
Williams
Valley
west
of
Tower
City
.

It
came
under
Reading
control
itself
within
a
few
years
.

The
Brookside
branch
was
cut
back
to
Keffer
's
Station
in
0000
,
ending
Tower
City
's
connection
with
the
then-Reading
Company
.

Notable
mine
disasters
The
Brookside
explosion
On
August
0
,
0000
,
a
double
explosion
occurred
at
the
East
Brookside
Colliery
,
claiming
the
lives
of
eighteen
men
and
seriously
injuring
two
more
.

After
the
colliery
had
ceased
production
on
Thursday
night
,
Charles
Portland
,
a
contractor
for
the
Reading
,
kept
some
of
the
men
at
work
.

The
work
force
consisted
of
"
Muckers
"
,
who
are
to
clean
out
debris
from
blasting
(
work
always
done
in
the
evening
)
,
a
mucker
boss
,
a
blacksmith
,
and
his
assistant
.

The
next
day
,
Mine
Boss
John
Farrell
and
Superintendent
John
Lorenz
entered
the
mine
to
inspect
some
new
work
.

At
about
noon
,
men
on
the
surface
reported
a
rumbling
sound
,
which
was
followed
by
clouds
of
dust
from
the
main
entrance
and
fan-house
.

A
rescue
party
of
six
men
was
mustered
and
lowered
into
the
slope
.

The
second
explosion
occurred
shortly
thereafter
,
roughly
00
minutes
after
the
first
.

The
work
crew
carried
of
dynamite
into
the
mine
the
night
before
the
explosion
.

It
has
been
speculated
that
,
during
the
course
of
work
,
one
of
the
mucker
's
shovels
may
have
struck
the
dynamite
,
detonating
it
.

The
second
explosion
is
felt
to
have
been
caused
by
mine
gases
released
by
the
first
explosion
.

The
Porter
Tunnel
inundation
On
Tuesday
,
March
0
,
0000
,
workers
in
the
Porter
Tunnel
mine
,
while
working
in
a
new
area
,
broke
into
a
flooded
area
of
the
abandoned
Bush
Old
Bootleg
Slope
Mine
,
causing
the
Porter
Tunnel
to
flood
.

Nine
miners
were
killed
,
three
were
injured
,
and
one
was
trapped
,
but
eventually
rescued
.

Subsequent
investigation
determined
that
the
map
of
the
area
used
by
management
of
the
Porter
Tunnel
was
inaccurate
.

It
did
not
show
the
locations
of
all
known
bootleg
mine
works
in
the
area
,
including
most
significantly
,
the
Bush
Old
Bootleg
.

Management
had
suspected
that
the
tunnel
was
nearby
,
and
had
instituted
a
program
of
drilling
test
holes
in
the
work
areas
to
probe
for
water
.

Workers
had
testified
that
this
program
was
discontinued
prior
to
the
flood
.
