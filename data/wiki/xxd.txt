Louisville
(
pronounced
LEWIS-ville
)
is
a
city
in
Stark
County
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Ohio
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Canton
–
Massillon
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Louisville
is
also
known
as
the
"
Constitution
Town
"
.

History
The
City
of
Louisville
is
now
within
Constitution
Township
and
surrounded
by
Nimishillen
Township
,
one
of
the
original
townships
of
Stark
County
.

The
City
of
Louisville
originated
from
Harrisburg
,
platted
in
0000
,
the
oldest
settled
community
in
Nimishillen
Township
.

Immigrants
were
first
attracted
to
the
area
because
of
its
abundant
timber
,
especially
chestnut
and
poplar
trees
.

Harrisburg
quickly
became
a
flourishing
village
serving
as
a
stagecoach
stop
,
situated
at
the
junction
of
roads
between
Canton
,
Alliance
,
Cleveland
and
Pittsburgh
.

In
0000
,
the
development
of
the
railroad
changed
the
history
of
the
village
,
drawing
business
to
the
area
.

Hauling
wheat
by
barge
was
a
marketing
disadvantage
for
Harrisburg
,
but
the
prosperity
of
Louisville
was
assured
with
the
coming
of
the
Pittsburgh
,
Fort
Wayne
,
and
Chicago
Railroads
in
0000
.

During
this
year
alone
,
000
new
lots
were
added
to
the
city
in
four
additions
,
and
several
industries
began
operation
,
using
the
railroad
to
expand
their
marketing
area
.

On
October
0
,
0000
,
Louisville
was
formally
settled
by
Henry
Lautzenheiser
,
from
Germany
,
and
Henry
Fainot
,
a
French
Huguenot
.

The
city
was
named
after
Lautzenheiser
's
son
,
Lewis
,
and
called
Lewisville
,
Ohio
.

When
the
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
it
was
discovered
Ohio
already
had
a
Lewisville
,
so
the
spelling
was
changed
to
Louisville
.

The
plat
contained
00
lots
;
00
owned
by
Lautzenheiser
and
00
by
Fainot
.

The
lots
measured
00
x
000
feet
and
extended
back
to
00-foot-wide
alleys
.

The
two
original
streets
were
Main
and
Chapel
.

In
0000
,
the
000
residents
of
Louisville
decided
to
incorporate
.

These
residents
farmed
and
worked
at
the
industries
who
began
operating
in
Louisville
.

Some
of
the
00th
century
industries
included
a
plow
manufacturing
company
,
a
woolen
mill
,
a
brewery
which
produced
0,000
barrels
annually
,
a
basket
factory
,
flour
mills
,
tanneries
,
and
a
brick
yard
.

The
Commercial
and
Washington
Hotels
served
the
merchants
and
other
travelers
passing
through
the
area
.

By
the
turn
of
the
century
,
the
flourishing
Louisville
was
in
need
of
adequate
public
services
.

In
0000
,
$
00,000
in
revenue
bonds
funded
a
public
water
system
,
and
the
first
sewage
system
was
installed
in
0000
.

Main
Street
was
the
first
to
be
paved
in
0000
and
0000
.

The
various
residences
,
businesses
and
community
facilities
exist
today
on
the
original
foundations
that
were
built
during
the
0000s
and
early
0000s
.

In
0000
,
Louisville
resident
Olga
T.
Weber
petitioned
municipal
officials
to
establish
Constitution
Day
,
in
honor
of
the
ratification
of
the
US
Constitution
in
0000
.

Presiding
Mayor
Gerald
A.
Romary
proclaimed
September
00
,
0000
,
as
Constitution
Day
in
the
city
.

The
following
April
,
Weber
requested
that
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
proclaim
September
00
as
state-wide
Constitution
Day
.

Her
request
was
signed
into
law
by
Governor
Frank
.

Weber
did
n't
stop
there
.

In
August
0000
,
she
urged
the
United
States
Senate
to
pass
a
resolution
designating
September
00-00
as
Constitution
Week
.

The
Senate
and
House
approved
her
request
and
it
was
signed
into
law
by
President
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
the
City
Council
of
Louisville
declared
the
city
Constitution
Town
.

The
Ohio
State
Archaeological
and
Historical
Society
later
donated
four
historical
markers
,
located
at
the
four
main
entrances
to
the
city
,
explaining
Louisville
's
role
as
originator
of
Constitution
Day
.

Little
Steel
Strike
Massillon
was
a
site
where
one
of
the
most
tragic
instances
of
anti-union
violence
in
the
history
of
the
United
States
occurred
.

The
Steel
Workers
Organizing
Committee
began
an
attempt
to
organize
workers
at
Republic
Steel
in
the
spring
of
0000
,
following
the
unionizing
of
workers
at
the
country
's
two
largest
steel
companies
US
Steel
and
Jones
&
Laughlin
Steel
.

In
retaliation
,
Republic
Steel
expelled
over
0000
union
supporters
at
plants
in
Canton
and
Massillon
.

On
May
00
,
the
union
eventually
called
for
all
workers
at
Republic
Steel
,
Youngstown
Sheet
and
Tube
,
and
Inland
Steel
(
together
known
as
Little
Steel
)
to
strike
in
response
to
the
treatment
of
workers
in
Massillon
and
Canton
.

On
the
night
of
July
00
,
0000
,
a
car
failed
to
dim
its
headlights
as
it
approached
a
police
barracade
near
a
picket
line
at
one
of
the
Massillon
plants
.

City
police
assumed
the
worst
and
without
warning
opened
fire
with
rifles
and
shotguns
.

Police
then
used
this
infraction
to
raid
a
peaceful
crowd
that
was
gathered
in
front
of
the
union
headquarters
.

Police
pumped
tear
gas
canisters
and
opened
fire
into
the
fleeing
crowd
.

Joined
by
National
Guardsmen
,
the
police
destroyed
the
union
hall
and
arrested
every
suspected
unionist
they
could
find
.

Three
men
were
killed
and
hundreds
were
injured
during
this
incident
.

(
April
00
,
0000
–
May

,
0000

was
an

a
"
Petition
in
Boots
"
demanding

United
States
Congress
allocate
funds
to
create
jobs
for
the
unemployed
.

Although
his
march
failed
,
Coxey
's
Army
was
an
early
attempt
to
arouse
political
interest
in
an
issue
that
grew
in

Social
Security
Act
of
0000
encouraged
the

Education
Preschool
,
elementary
,
and
secondary
education
is
mainly
provided
by
the
Akron
City
School
District
.

Planning
of
the
district
began
in
0000
,
when
Ansel
Miller
suggested
to
build
free
public
schools
for
all
children
in
the
city
,
paid
for
by
property
taxes
.

After
enduring
much
opposition
by
citizens
,
in
0000
Miller
joined
with
Rev.
Isaac
Jennings
.

Three
years
later
,
Jennings
became
the
chairman
of
a
committee
of
citizens
who
discussed
how
to
improve
the
school
system
.

On
November
00
,
0000
,
their
plan
was
approved
unanimously
by
the
citizens
.

The
Ohio
Legislature
adopted
the
plan
,
called
"
An
act
for
the
support
and
better
regulation
of
the
Common
Schools
of
the
Town
of
Akron
"
on
February

,
0000
.

Akron
’s
first
public
schools
were
established
in
the
fall
of
0000
and
were
led
by
Mortimer
Leggett
.

The
first
annual
report
showed
that
it
cost
less
than
$
0
a
year
to
educate
a
child
.

In
0000
the
cost
of
running
the
schools
for
a
year
was
$
0,000
.

The
primary
schools
were
taught
by
young
women
,
which
the
Akron
Board
of
Education
justified
because
they
could
be
paid
less
and
were
under
the
supervision
of
a
male
superintendent
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
Akron
graduated
students
semi-annually
instead
of
annually
.

0
%
of
the
city
’s
school-aged
population
were
born
in
other
countries
in
0000
.

In
the
0000s
,
an
Americanization
program
was
designed
to
help
the
many
Akron
students
who
were
first-generation
Americans
.

Classes
were
in
the
rubber
companies
and
some
of
the
schools
.

A
“
continuation
school
”
began
for
working
boys
and
girls
who
were
required
by
law
to
have
at
least
four
hours
of
schooling
a
week
.

In
0000
,
Akron
's
platoon
schools
attracted
visitors
from
all
over
the
country
.

Being
a
stronghold
for
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
during
the
decade
,
the
majority
of
school
board
and
government
officials
were
members
.

Their
influence
ended
with
the
arrival
of
Wendell
Willkie
.

During
the
city
's
0000s
boom
town
phase
,
Akron
schools
grew
eight
times
faster
than
the
city
’s
population
.

In
0000
,
Kenmore
launched
the
Air
Force
JROTC
.

In
0000
,
Jennings
piloted
the
middle
school
model
,
which
moved
ninth-graders
to
the
senior
high
school
.

In
0000
,
all-day
kindergarten
was
piloted
at
Seiberling
,
Rankin
and
Hatton
schools
,
and
Ellet
,
East
and
Garfield
high
schools
piloted
the
in-school
suspension
program
.

The
district
received
an
A
+
evaluation
from
the
state
in
0000
.

The
city
is
home
to
the
University
of
Akron
,
which
the
Princeton
Review
listed
among
the
Best
in
the
Midwest
,
in

.

Originally
Buchtel
College
,
the
school
is
home
of
the
Goodyear
Polymer

and
the
National
Polymer
Innovation

.

All
Akron
Public

are
currently
going
through
a
00-year
,
$

million
rebuilding
process
.

In

have
been
moved

by

Akron
also
has
many

History
Barberton
was
founded
in
0000
by
Ohio
Columbus
Barber
,
who
planned
the
town
according
to
his
vision
of
industry
,
progress
and
community
.

In
0000
he
moved
the
manufacturing
operations
of
the
Diamond
Match
Company
,
formed
from
a
merger
of
00
companies
,
from
Akron
to
Barberton
,
where
he
soon
was
producing
000
million
matches
a
day
.

In
the
valley
running
parallel
to
the
Tuscarawas
River
and
the
Ohio
&
Erie
Canal
,
he
oversaw
the
construction
of
factories
,
residential
neighborhoods
and
a
compact
commercial
downtown
.

In
the
center
of
the
new
city
was
Lake
Anna
,
named
after
Barber
's
only
daughter
,
Anna
Laura
Barber
.

Barberton
became
known
as
the
"
Sorcery
City
"
,
due
to
its
rapid
population
growth
during
its
formative
industrial
years
,
at
a
time
of
waves
of
immigration
from
eastern
and
southern
Europe
.

In
0000
,
when
it
was
incorporated
,
the
scattered
farms
that
had
originally
characterized
the
landscape
were
transformed
into
a
fledgling
city
of
0,000
.

When
an
Akron
Beacon
Journal
reporter
revisited
Barberton
in
0000
,
he
noted
that
since
0000
,
Barberton
had
grown
so
quickly
that
the
town
appeared
to
grow
by
witchcraft
(
hence
its
nickname
)
.

Many
new
immigrants
were
attracted
to
its
industrial
jobs
.

In
0000
on
a
high
hill
on
the
east
side
of
town
,
Barber
began
construction
of
an
experimental
farm
and
estate
,
comprising
a
French
Renaissance
Revival
mansion
,
completed
in
0000
,
and
lush
gardens
,
dozens
of
barns
and
other
structures
in
the
same
style
,
and
greenhouses
,
which
he
called
Anna
Dean
Farm
.

The
00-room
mansion
survived
until
0000
.

Most
of
the
00-acre
Barber
estate
was
lost
to
residential
redevelopment
following
World
War
II
,
and
the
mansion
was
demolished
.

Barber
built
00
structures
for
the
Anna
Dean
Farm
,
all
in
the
French
Renaissance
Revival
style
.

The
farm
covered
0000
acres
.

Believing
farming
could
be
as
efficient
as
industry
,
Barber
intended
the
farm
to
be
the
basis
of
an
agricultural
college
,
but
he
did
not
complete
financing
before
his
death
.

He
willed
the
farm
to
Case
Western
University
,
which
sold
much
of
the
property
.

Today
,
five
of
the
eight
buildings
are
owned
by
the
Barberton
Historical
Society
.

These
buildings
are
constructed
of
red
brick
edged
in
white
concrete
block
,
with
royal
blue
trim
and
red
tile
roofing
.

The
most
significant
of
the
remaining
buildings
is
Barn
No.
0
,
the
former
Dairy
Barn
,
restored
in
0000
and
now
the
world
headquarters
of
the
Yoder
Brothers
Corporation
,
horticulturists
.

The
building
has
castle
tower-like
silos
,
visible
from
much
of
the
east
side
of
the
city
.

The
other
barns
have
been
structurally
stabilized
and
at
least
partially
restored
.

All
but
one
may
be
renovated
for
other
economic
uses
.
"

The
Magics
"
became
the
mascot
name
of
the
Barberton
High
School
athletic
teams
.

As
Barberton
High
School
colors
are
purple
and
white
,
"
purple
pride
"
marks
local
enthusiasm
for
the
school
.

Barberton
High
School
has
been
recognized
for
athletic
prowess
in
recent
years
,
winning
state
championships
in
basketball
,
football
,
and
track
and
field
.

The
city
's
schools
have
begun
to
increase
academic
performance
since
the
0000s
.

Barberton
's
sources
of
news
include
daily
newspapers
,
such
as
the
Cleveland
Plain
Dealer
,
Akron
Beacon
Journal
and
a
weekly
newspaper
,
the
Barberton
Herald
.

During
the
0000s
Barberton
suffered
a
precipitous
economic
decline
due
to
the
losses
and
restructuring
in
industry
,
similar
to
much
of
the
American
Midwest
.

It
was
in
many
ways
representative
of
a
typical
Rust
Belt
city
.

During
this
period
,
the
city
lost
a
large
part
of
its
economic
base
as
factories
shuttered
and
storefronts
went
vacant
.

The
Magic
City
:
Unemployment
in
a
Working-Class
Community
(
Cornell
University
Press
,
0000
)
documents
the
consequences
of
the
migration
of
major
industry
from
the
region
and
the
responses
of
residents
to
such
dramatic
changes
.

In
0000
,
key
business
stakeholders
and
government
leaders
created
the
Barberton
Community
Development
Corporation
(
BCDC
)
.

The
BCDC
today
functions
through
a
Board
of
Directors
of
00
stakeholders
and
city
members
,
including
the
Mayor
of
Barberton
,
and
led
by
Tom
Anders
as
Chairman
,
and
Executive
Director
Larry
Lallo
,
has
facilitated
the
creation
of
over
0000
jobs
,
and
in
excess
of
$
000
million
in
business
expansion
projects
.

They
have
stimulated
the
creation
of
three
mini-industrial
parks
,
and
00
new
construction
projects
.

The
BCDC
was
originally
funded
through
federal
funds
,
and
donations
of
real
estate
by
the
Babcock
and
Wilcox
Company
.

With
the
creation
of
the
Barberton
Community
Foundation
in
the
late
0000s
,
the
BCDC
entered
into
a
new
level
.

It
invested
a
portion
of
the
Foundation
's
assets
in
prime
credit
business
expansion
projects
.

The
Barberton
Community
Foundation
facilitated
the
construction
of
a
new
Barberton
High
School
,
located
on
reclaimed
swampland
in
the
northwest
section
of
the

Cuyahoga
Falls
is
a
city
in
Summit
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
city
population
was
00,000
.

It
is
currently
the
second
largest
city
in
Summit
County
.

It
is
a
suburb
of
Akron
and
Cleveland
and
part
of
the
Akron
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
and
the
Cleveland-Akron-Elyria
Combined
Statistical
Area
.

Actually
older
than
Akron
,
the
city
was
founded
in
0000
by
William
Wetmore
and
was
originally
named
Manchester
.

Cuyahoga
Falls
is
named
after
the
Cuyahoga
River
(
which
flows
into
Lake
Erie
)
and
the
series
of
waterfalls
that
run
along
the
southern
boundary
of
the
city
.

Cuyahoga
Falls
is
bordered
by
Akron
to
the
south
and
the
Cuyahoga
Valley
National
Park
to
the
northwest
.

History
Cuyahoga
Falls
was
formed
in
0000
near
the
junction
of
what
was
then
Northampton
,
Stow
,
Tallmadge
,
and
Portage
townships
.

The
focus
was
the
series
of
Cuyahoga
River
waterfalls
that
provided
power
for
manufacturing
.

In
0000
Kelsey
and
Wilcox
built
a
dam
on
the
Cuyahoga
River
at
a
place
where
a
railroad
bridge
crossed
it
in
0000
.

They
then
built
a
flour
mill
,
an
oil
mill
,
and
a
saw
mill
.

This
led
to
the
construction
of
a
number
of
houses
.

This
area
was
known
as
the
old
village
.

Development
moved
downstream
,
though
,
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
power
was
better
there
.

The
old
village
was
eventually
destroyed
in
0000
when
a
dam
built
by
William
Wetmore
flooded
the
dam
at
the
old
village
and
its
mills
were
torn
down
.

The
earliest
settler
of
Cuyahoga
Falls
included
Joshua
Stow
and
William
Wetmore
.

In
0000
a
saw-mill
was
operating
near
Gaylord
's
Grove
,
using
power
generated
by
a
dam
on
the
Cuyahoga
River
there
.

The
town
was
initially
called
Manchester
but
was
renamed
Cuyahoga
Falls
at
the
request
of
the
Post
Office
since
there
were
already
several
other
Manchesters
in
Ohio
.

The
village
proper
was
first
laid
out
in
0000
by
Judge
Richardson
.

The
town
was
incorporated
in
0000
,
occupying
000
rods
out
of
Stow
and
Tallmadge
townships
.

In
0000
,
seeing
that
the
village
and
township
of
Cuyahoga
Falls
occupied
the
same
territory
,
the
village
council
disbanded
and
the
community
was
only
a
township
until
0000
.

In
0000
the
Summit
County
Board
of
Commissioners
named
Cuyahoga
Falls
the
county
seat
.

The
state
legislature
then
intervened
and
put
the
location
of
the
county
seat
up
to
a
popular
vote
.

Akron
won
and
has
been
the
county
seat
ever
since
.

In
spite
of
being
named
the
county
seat
Cuyahoga
Falls
never
really
functioned
as
such
.

In
March
0000
the
township
of
Cuyahoga
Falls
was
created
out
of
the
village
limits
.

They
covered
the
same
territory
so
the
village
council
voted
to
adjourn
sine
die
,
letting
the
village
be
run
under
township
jurisdiction
until
June
0
,
0000
when
the
municipal
government
returned
.

On
July
0
,
0000
the
Doodlebug
Disaster
train
wreck
killed
00
people
;
the
worst
disaster
in
the
history
of
the
city
.

In
0000
,
a
referendum
of
merger
between
the
city
and
neighboring
Northampton
Township
was
placed
on
the
ballots
of
,
and
approved
by
,
local
voters
.

In
0000
,
Cuyahoga
Falls
merged
with
Northampton
Township
,
the
first
merger
of
a
city
and
township
in
Ohio
.

Cuyahoga
Falls
had
been
founded
as
an
industrial
city
,
taking
advantage
of
the
river
power
.

By
the
0000s
,
though
,
it
had
become
a
residential
community
.

This
changed
,
though
,
when
Don
Robart
became
mayor
.

He
had
been
in
favor
of
the
merger
with
Northampton
Township
because
of
the
additional
land
that
could
be
used
for
development
.

Parts
of
that
area
have
since
been
used
for
industrial
development
.

Commercial
development
has
also
picked
up
,
especially
on
the
Howe
Avenue
area
at
the
southern
border
of
the
city
.

The
city
had
one
professional
sports
team
,
the
Cuyahoga
Falls
Cougars
,
of
the
International
Basketball
League
.

They
moved
to
Akron
in
0000
and
became
the
Akron
Cougars
.

The
Cathedral
of
Tomorrow
,
founded
by
televangelist
Rex
Humbard
in
0000
,
is
located
in
Cuyahoga
Falls
.

It

Incorporation
The
impetus
for
Green
to
become
a
city
arose
in
part
out
of
controversy
generated
by
a
letter
supposedly
written
by
former
Akron
City
Schools
superintendent
Conrad
Ott
.

The
letter
spoke
of
willingness
by
Akron
to
annex
Green
schools
.

Few
voters
realized
that
school
districts
are
separate
entities
under
Ohio
law
.

Property
annexation
to
a
city
does
not
change
the
school
district
.

Nevertheless
,
the
rally
to
save
independent
schools
helped
spur
the
drive
to
incorporate
.

Munroe
Falls
is
a
city
located
in
the
east-central
portion
of
Summit
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
between
Stow
and
Tallmadge
.

It
is
a
suburb
of
Akron
and
is
part
of
the
Akron
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Like
much
of
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
,
the
area
that
makes
up
present-day
Munroe
Falls
was
previously
inhabited
by
various
tribes
of
American
Indians
.

When
the
Western
Reserve
began
being
surveyed
in
0000
,
what
is
now
Munroe
Falls
was
mostly
in
the
southern
part
of
the
survey
township
Town
0
,
Range
00
(
later
to
be
Stow
Township
)
,
then
a
part
of
Washington
County
before
being
placed
in
the
new
Jefferson
County
the
following
year
.

In
0000
,
it
was
made
part
of
Trumbull
County
,
which
followed
the
boundaries
of
the
Western
Reserve
,
and
in
0000
,
the
area
was
made
part
of
Portage
County
.

The
first
settlers
in
present-day
Munroe
Falls
,
a
group
of
around
00
people
including
Francis
Kelsey
and
William
Stow
,
came
in
0000
.

Kelsey
built
a
sawmill
on
the
south
side
of
the
Cuyahoga
River
and
a
gristmill
was
built
on
the
north
side
.

The
initial
name
of
the
new
village
was
Kelsey
's
Mills
(
also
Kelsey
Mills
)
.

In
0000
a
wooden
dam
was
built
to
provide
power
for
both
mills
and
the
name
of
the
village
was
changed
to
Florence
.

Around
0000
,
William
and
Edmund
Munroe
(
also
spelled
Monroe
)
from
Boston
arrived
and
purchased
the
two
mills
and
approximately
of
land
around
them
to
lay
out
a
new
village
,
which
they
named
Munroe
Falls
.

The
village
was
incorporated
October
00
,
0000
.

The
Munroes
had
great
plans
for
the
village
to
become
a
center
of
commerce
and
an
important
city
,
but
these
plans
never
worked
out
.

After
about
00
years
,
which
included
the
economic
instability
of
the
Panic
of
0000
,
the
Munroes
defaulted
to
many
of
the
creditors
and
the
properties
they
owned
were
taken
over
by
other
individuals
.

The
Pennsylvania
and
Ohio
Canal
opened
in
0000
and
passed
through
Munroe
Falls
.

It
closed
around
0000
.

Also
in
0000
,
Munroe
Falls
was
made
part
of
the
new
Summit
County
.

In
0000
,
the
old
gristmill
was
purchased
by
the
Cleveland
Paper
Company
and
refitted
for
paper
manufacturing
.

The
building
burned
down
approximately
0
–
0
years
later
and
the
present
factory
-
today
owned
by
Sonoco
Products
-
was
built
on
the
same
site
.

In
0000
railroad
tracks
were
laid
in
the
former
canal
bed
as
part
of
a
single
line
owned
by
the
Pittsburgh
and
Western
Railroad
.

These
tracks
were
doubled
in
0000
following
the
purchase
of
the
railroad
by
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
Ohio
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(
EPA
)
and
Summit
County
determined
that
the
oxygen
levels
were
too
low
in
the
Cuyahoga
River
,
due
mostly
to
the
stagnant
pool
behind
the
Munroe
Falls
dam
.

The
solution
was
to
lower
the
dam
,
which
dated
to
0000
.

Eventually
,
the
entire
dam
was
removed
after
workers
discovered
a
natural
ledge
underneath
the
existing
dam
.

This
project
,
begun
in
August
0000
and
completed
in
October
0000
,
was
part
of
a
larger
project
along
much
of
the
river
in
the
city
that
included
cleanup
and
restoration
.

Stow
is
located
adjacent

communities
in

and
the

of
Silver

,

,
on

by

and

by

Falls
.

History
Stow
is
named
for
Joshua
Stow
,
its
original
proprietor
.

Joshua
Stow
was
a
member
of
the
party
led
by
Moses
Cleaveland
to
survey
the
lands
of
the
Connecticut
Western
Reserve
around
present-day
Cleveland
in
0000
.

He
was
a
native
of
Middletown
,
Connecticut
,
however
,
and
never
lived
in
Stow
,
though
he
spent
both
time
and
money
developing
the
township
and
is
quoted
as
saying
it
was
"
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
romantic
spots
in
the
Western
Reserve
.
"

The
land
that
would
eventually
be
known
as
Stow
Township
was
the
survey
township
"
Town
0
,
Range
00
"
of
the
Western
Reserve
and
was
initially
.

It
was
purchased
by
Joshua
Stow
for
$
00,000
.

Prior
to
the
arrival
of
European
settlers
,
the
area
around
what
is
now
Stow
was
inhabited
by
a
tribe
of
Seneca
Native
Americans
at
a
small
settlement
in
the
area
that
is
now
part
of
the
neighboring
village
of
Silver
Lake
.

The
first
settler
in
Stow
Township
was
William
Walker
,
who
arrived
in
0000
.

Walker
built
a
cabin
just
south
of
the
land
of
his
father
Robert
in
Hudson
Township
mistakenly
believing
he
was
building
in
Hudson
.

In
0000
,
when
Stow
Township
was
separated
from
Hudson
Township
and
surveyed
into
lots
by
Joseph
Darrow
,
it
was
discovered
his
house
was
actually
in
Stow
Township
.

Walker
purchased
the
lot
his
home
was
on
and
continued
to
live
there
.

Darrow
had
been
hired
by
Joshua
Stow
's
land
agent
William
Wetmore
,
a
settler
also
from
Middletown
,
Connecticut
,
who
moved
to
Stow
in
0000
with
his
family
and
several
other
settlers
.

The
Wetmores
built
a
cabin
in
July
0000
near
the
center
of
Stow
Township
and
the
present-day
intersection
of
Darrow
Road
and
Kent
Road
.

In
0000
,
the
Wetmores
built
a
home
near
the
Seneca
settlement
in
what
is
now
Silver
Lake
.

The
house
overlooked
a
small
lake
,
known
as
Silver
Lake
since
0000
,
that
was
known
earlier
as
Wetmore
Pond
or
Stow
Lake
.

Stow
Township
was
formally
organized
in
0000
with
the
first
election
held
in
0000
.

0000
was
also
the
year
it
was
made
part
of
the
original
Portage
County
.

It
remained
as
part
of
Portage
County
until
it
was
included
in
the
new
Summit
County
in
0000
.

Most
of
the
original
township
is
part
of
the
present
day
city
of
Stow
,
but
parts
of
the
original
township
form
all
or
part
of
three
neighboring
communities
.

Munroe
Falls
was
settled
in
0000
as
"
Kelsey
Mills
"
in
the
southern
part
of
Stow
Township
and
incorporated
as
a
village
in
0000
.

Cuyahoga
Falls
was
developed
on
land
owned
by
Wetmore
and
Joshua
Stow
beginning
in
0000
in
the
southwestern
part
of
the
township
and
became
a
town
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Cuyahoga
Falls
Township
was
created
,
taking
the
southwest
corner
of
Stow
Township
along
with
parts
of
three
neighboring
townships
.

Cuyahoga
Falls
incorporated
as
a
village
in
0000
and
later
annexed
additional
portions
of
Stow
Township
in
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
as
did
Munroe
Falls
.

Silver
Lake
incorporated
as
a
village
in
0000
on
land
that
had
previously
been
part
of
Stow
Township
.

The
remainder
of
Stow
Township
incorporated
in
0000
as
a
village
and
became
a
city
following
the
0000
United
States
Census
.

History
In
0000
,
Nehemiah
Hubbard
,
Jr.
,
an
energetic
and
respected
merchant
from
Middletown
,
Connecticut
,
purchased
a
plot
of
about
,
known
as
Hubbard
Township
.

After
purchasing
the
Hubbard
Township
property
,
Nehemiah
Hubbard
made
his
first
sale
of
land
to
Samuel
Tylee
,
a
surveyor
in
Connecticut
,
and
engaged
him
as
his
agent
in
this
new
territory
.

Tylee
and
others
then
came
to
find
and
measure
plots
suitable
for
sale
to
early
settlers
.

Until
0000
Hubbard
remained
a
country-crossroads
with
relatively
few
houses
or
inhabitants
;
however
,
when
the
coal
fields
began
to
develop
,
the
corners
rapidly
became
a
village
.

The
increase
in
population
was
due
for
the
most
part
to
the
emigration
of
people
from
Europe
,
people
in
search
of
the
opportunity
of
a
better
way
of
life
.

By
0000
the
village
had
attained
the
required
population
and
it
became
an
incorporated
municipality
.

Newton
Falls
is
a
city
located
within
Newton
Township
in
Trumbull
County
,
Ohio
in
the
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Youngstown
-
Warren
-
Boardman
,
OH
-
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
city
is
known
for
its
ZIP
code
,
which
is
00000
,
and
for
its
covered
bridge
,
which
is
the
second
oldest
in
the
state
of
Ohio
,
and
one
of
only
two
in
Ohio
with
an
integrated
covered
walkway
(
the
other
being
the
Smolen-Gulf
Covered
Bridge
in
Ashtabula
County
)
.

The
city
earned
its
name
from
the
two
sets
of
falls
within
the
city
,
each
on
different
branches
of
the
Mahoning
River
.

History
Newton
Falls
was
likely
named
for
the
first
school
teacher
,
Newton
,
and
the
falls
south
of
the
Covered
Bridge
which
is
presently
under
water
from
the
dam
constructed
along
First
Street
.

It
grew
in
part
from
factors
such
as
the
river
and
its
falls
,
steel
manufacturing
,
and
the
proximity
of
the
nearby
Ravenna
Training
and
Logistics
Site
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
an
F0
tornado
struck
the
city
as
part
of
The
0000
United
States-Canadian
tornado
outbreak
,
a
deadly
series
of
tornadoes
that
swept
through
Ohio
,
Pennsylvania
,
New
York
,
and
Ontario
,
Canada
.

The
tornado
to
hit
Newton
Falls
was
the
only
F0
to
hit
Ohio
that
day
.

The
tornado
damaged
most
of
the
downtown
area
destroying
dozens
of
homes
,
damaging
the
Senior
and
Junior
High
Schools
(
destroying
the
gymnasium
and
rendering
the
Junior
High
unusable
)
,
and
devastating
many
businesses
.

Remarkably
,
no
deaths
were
attributed
to
the
tornado
.

There
were
between
00
and
00
injuries
in
the
entire
town
.

They
discovered
that
just
in
Newton
Falls
alone
,
000
families
were
homeless
and
the
entire
central
business
district
had
been
destroyed
.

They
indicated
that
warning
sirens
were
the
main
reason
the
death
toll
was
n't
that
high
.
"

If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
(
warning
)
sirens
,
the
death
toll
might
have
been
higher
,
"
stated
Ohio
National
Guard
Major
Calvin
Taylor
.

There
was
even
television
footage
of
one
of
the
freight
trains
being
taken
from
its
tracks
.

On
July
0
,
0000
,
the
city
was
shaken
by
a
shooting
rampage
in
the
East
River
Gardens
apartment
complex
.

Robert
Brazzon
murdered
four
people
,
including
a
fifteen
year-old
boy
,
before
taking
his
own
life
in
a
city
cemetery
.

No
motive
was
ever
established
.

Attractions
Covered
Bridge
Newton
Falls
is
home
to
the
only
remaining
00th
century
covered
bridge
in
Ohio
,
which
was
constructed
over
the
Mahoning
River
in
0000
.

A
walkway
was
added
to
the
side
of
the
bridge
in
0000
–
0000
.

In
0000
the
bridge
was
repaired
after
being
damaged
by
the
Niles/Wheatland
tornado
.

In
December
0000
the
bridge
was
reopened
after
a
two-year
restoration
funded
by
government
grants
.

In
July
0000
a
delivery
truck
damaged
the
bridge
and
rendered
it
out
of
service
until
repairs
could
be
made
.

It
reopened
in

Niles
is
a
city
in
Trumbull
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
city
's
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Youngstown
-
Warren
-
Boardman
,
OH
-
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Located
in
the
nation
's
former
industrial
belt
,
the
city
's
economy
focused
initially
on
iron
manufacturing
but
later
diversified
to
include
steel
and
glass
production
.

Niles
was
adversely
affected
by
the
decline
of
the
manufacturing
sector
throughout
the
northern
United
States
in
the
0000s
.

History
Niles
was
founded
in
0000
by
James
Heaton
,
who
owned
one
of
the
first
iron-ore
processing
plants
in
Ohio
.

The
town
originally
went
by
the
name
of
Heaton
's
Furnace
but
was
later
renamed
Nilestown
,
after
Hezekiah
Niles
(
editor
of
the
Niles
Register
,
a
Baltimore
newspaper
)
.

In
0000
,
the
name
was
shortened
to
Niles
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
Heaton
built
a
forge
and
,
later
,
a
charcoal
blast
furnace
in
the
area
just
east
of
what
is
now
the
city
's
central
park
,
on
the
west
side
of
Mosquito
Creek
.

Heaton
is
credited
with
producing
the
first
bar
iron
in
Ohio
.

Niles
'
iron
industry
thrived
until
the
late
00th
century
,
when
the
economic
depression
of
0000
brought
about
the
closure
of
the
community
's
largest
industrial
firm
,
James
Ward
and
Company
.

Plans
to
restore
the
local
iron
industry
floundered
because
of
the
exorbitant
cost
of
modernizing
outdated
mills
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
however
,
Niles
was
the
site
of
companies
including
Ohio
Galvanizing
,
Sykes
Metal
,
the
Niles
Glass
Works
of
the
General
Electric
Company
,
and
the
Niles
Iron
and
Steel
Roofing
Company
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
the
city
's
population
swelled
from
0,000
to
slightly
over
00,000
.

The
community
's
efforts
to
rebuild
its
industry
suffered
a
temporary
setback
in
the
0000s
.

Niles
was
one
of
many
cities
affected
by
statewide
floods
that
struck
in
the
spring
of
0000
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
Easter
Sunday
,
heavy
rain
throughout
Ohio
,
combined
with
ice
and
snow
that
was
still
on
the
ground
,
precipitated
massive
flooding
.

Flooding
of
the
Mahoning
River
left
extensive
damage
and
numerous
casualties
in
Niles
.

Damage
exceeded
$
0
million
,
and
000
people
were
confirmed
dead
.

Throughout
much
of
the
00th
century
,
Niles
was
known
to
most
Ohioans
as
the
birthplace
of
William
McKinley
,
the
00th
President
of
the
United
States
.

McKinley
was
born
in
Niles
on
January
00
,
0000
.

He
attended
school
at
Niles
High
School
(
and
the
city
's
high
school
would
eventually
be
renamed
Niles
McKinley
High
School
)
.

President
McKinley
's
assassination
in
0000
shocked
the
nation
and
particularly
saddened
residents
of
northeastern
Ohio
.

In
0000
,
Youngstown
industrialist
Joseph
G.
Butler
,
Jr.
,
a
childhood
friend
of
President
McKinley
,
campaigned
for
the
construction
of
the
Ethan
and
Drama
Memorial
in
downtown
Niles
.

The
facility
currently
houses
the
community
's
library
as
well
as
a
small
museum
.

Niles
'
location
in
the
Mahoning
Valley
,
a
center
of
steel
production
,
ensured
that
the
community
would
become
a
destination
for
immigrants
from
Southern
and
Eastern
Europe
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Dramatic
demographic
change
fueled
ethnic
and
religious
tension
throughout
the
northern
United
States
following
World
War
I
,
and
Niles
proved
to
be
no
exception
to
this
trend
.

In
the
0000s
,
regional
chapters
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
targeted
Niles
because
of
its
large
Catholic
population
.

The
nativist
organization
marched
through
the
center
of
Niles
in
May
0000
,
and
attempted
another
march
in
June
of
the
same
year
.

When
violence
forced
the
Klan
to
cancel
the
second
march
,
the
event
was
rescheduled
for
November
0
,
0000
.

The
local
mayor
's
ultimate
decision
to
issue
the
Klan
a
permit
for
the
march
outraged
many
of
the
community
's
Italian
-
and
Irish-American
residents
.

In
response
to
the
scheduled
Klan
march
,
an
anti-Klan
organization
,
the
Knights
of
the
Flaming
Circle
,
pledged
to
hold
their
own
parade
of
00,000
participants
on
the
same
day
.

On
October
00
,
the
mayor
's
house
was
bombed
,
due
to
his
refusal
to
revoke
the
permit
.

Tensions
escalated
from
this
point
on
,
and
the
city
gained
national
attention
due
to
the
impending
marches
.

Despite
the
city
's
pleas
for
assistance
from
the
militia
,
they
were
denied
.

The
result
was
00
hours
of
full-blown
rioting
.

Control
was
brought
to
the
town
,
requiring
00
days
of
martial
law
.

Between
the
Klan
and
anti-
Klan
participants
,
000
people
were
indicted
.

The
conflict
was
a
turning
point
in
long-running
hostilities
between
nativists
and
immigrants
in
the
Mahoning
Valley
,
and
in
its
wake
,
the
Klan
's
influence
gradually
subsided
.

Niles
'
economy
was
undermined
in
the
0000s
,
when
the
Mahoning
Valley
's
steel
industry
–
already
in
decline
–
collapsed
.

Amid
the
economic
challenges
that
followed
,
the
community
faced
another
natural
catastrophe
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
city
of
Niles
was
struck
by
an
F0
tornado
that
had
its
origins
just
west
of
Newton
Falls
,
where
it
destroyed
much
of
that
town
.

The
tornado
then
moved
through
Lordstown
and
Warren
,
before
wreaking
havoc
on
Niles
,

Dennison
is
a
village
in
Tuscarawas
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
confluence
of
coal
and
railroads
drove
the
development
of
Dennison
.

It
is
conveniently
located
at
the
midpoint
between
Pittsburgh
and
Columbus
--
from
each
.

At
the
time
,
locomotives
needed
water
every
,
so
Dennison
was
a
natural
refilling
location
.

The
Dennison
Coal
Company
had
mines
south
of
town
.

In
0000
,
The
Pittsburgh
,
Cincinnati
&
St.
Louis
Railway
decided
to
locate
the
country
's
largest
railroad
shops
and
yards
in
Dennison
.

Dennison
Land
Company
laid
out
the
town
of
Dennison
in
0000
and
purchased
land
expressly
for
the
town
.

Demand
for
passenger
service
led
to
construction
of
a
station
in
0000
.

Thousands
moved
to
the
area
for
jobs
in
the
roundhouses
,
turntables
and
foundries
.

At
its
peak
,
0,000
people
worked
in
the
railyards
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
Company
eventually
subsumed
the
Pittsburgh
,
Cincinnati
&
St.
Louis
Railway
.

The
village
incorporated
in
0000
,
and
was
named
for
governor
William
Dennison
.

During
World
War
I
,
the
Red
Cross
operated
a
canteen
from
a
boxcar
.

Canteen
volunteers
prepared
coffee
and
sandwiches
for
troops
traveling
through
by
train
.

In
0000
,
a
strike
marked
the
end
of
the
golden
era
of
Dennison
.

During
World
War
II
,
the
Dennison
Canteen
operated
from
March
00
,
0000
to
April
0
,
0000
.

Initially
in
a
gas
station
on
Center
and
Fifth
Street
,
it
moved
to
the
depot
restaurant
and
was
dubbed
"
Dreamsville
"
.

The
last
passenger
train
service
stopped
in
0000
.

The
last
freight
train
stop
in
Dennison
was
in
0000
.

Freight
trains
still
roll
through
,
but
they
no
longer
stop
in
Dennison
.

In
the
0000s
,
Dennison
elected
Greg
DiDonato
as
a
member
of
council
(
while
he
was
still
a
high
school
student
)
and
then
elected
him
mayor
.

He
went
on
to
serve
as
Ohio
State
Representative
,
Ohio
State
Senator
and
minority
leader
of
the

Dover
is
a
city
in
Tuscarawas
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
and
features
Dover
was
originally
part
of
a
grant
to
Col.
James
Morrison
of
Kentucky
,
who
had
received
it
from
the
federal
government
for
Revolutionary
War
services
.

In
0000
,
two
brothers-in-law
from
Baltimore
,
Maryland
,
Christian
Deardorff
and
Jesse
Slingluff
,
traveled
through
the
area
and
so
admired
the
potential
quality
of
the
land
along
the
confluence
of
the
Tuscarawas
River
and
Sugarcreek
that
they
bought
of
land
in
0000
for
just
over
$
0,000
.

The
brothers-in-law
settled
there
and
the
following
year
laid
out
the
what
they
hoped
would
become
a
prosperous
town
.

It
took
a
while
;
by
0000
,
there
were
only
five
buildings
in
Dover
,
including
three
taverns
.

The
founders
had
hoped
Dover
would
become
the
county
seat
,
but
that
honor
went
to
the
neighboring
town
of
New
Philadelphia
.

The
county
grew
,
even
if
Dover
did
not
.

The
region
around
Tuscarawas
country
was
settled
in
large
part
by
ethnic
German
and
Moravian
families
migrating
westward
from
Pennsylvania
.

Even
today
,
the
local
telephone
book
features
many
German
last
names
.

Dover
's
fortunes
changed
dramatically
when
the
Tuscarawas
River
was
incorporated
into
the
Ohio
Canal
system
in
0000
.

This
canal
complex
linked
the
Ohio
River
to
the
Great
Lakes
and
the
Erie
Canal
.

Dover
became
the
only
tolling
station
on
the
Tuscarawas
,
and
the
population
grew
rapidly
from
00
in
0000
to
almost
000
in
0000
.

The
town
was
known
as
Canal
Dover
for
many
years
,
partly
to
distinguish
it
from
other
Ohio
settlements
that
had
adopted
the
same
name
.

A
series
of
mills
was
built
along
the
Tuscarawas
.

This
began
the
transition
of
Dover
from
an
agricultural
and
trade
center
to
a
thriving
industrial
community
.

Although
the
canal
system
declined
with
the
coming
of
the
railroad
,
the
entire
region
,
stretching
from
Pittsburgh
to
Cleveland
and
on
to
Detroit
,
became
a
center
of
heavy
industry
.

By
the
mid-0000s
,
Dover
already
had
its
first
blast
furnace
for
making
steel
and
had
established
a
steel
rolling
mill
in
0000
.

Dover
was
formally
incorporated
as
a
city
in
0000
.

By
the
middle
of
the
00th
century
,
Dover
featured
a
variety
of
heavy
industries
.

These
included
a
clay
pipe
works
,
various
machinery
and
chemical
manufacturers
,
and
a
pair
of
specialty
steel
companies
.

Despite
its
industrial
base
,
Dover
remained
heavily
influenced
by
the
nearby
agricultural
communities
,
particularly
the
Amish
and
Mennonite
communities
in
Sugarcreek
.

Such
communities
extended
to
Amish-dominated
Holmes
County
.

Today
,
however
,
agriculture
plays
a
much
less
prominent
role
in
Dover
than
in
years
past
.

In
recent
years
,
Dover
has
been
affected
by
the
decline
in
heavy
industry
in
the
region
,
but
continues
to
grow
and
diversity
its
economic
base
.

Dover
is
adjacent
to
New
Philadelphia
,
the
county
seat
of
Tuscarawas
County
,
with
the
0
cities
considered
to
be
twin
cities
.

Each
year
,
the
"
Tornadoes
"
of
Dover
High
School
play
the
rival
"
Quakers
"
of
New
Philadelphia
in
a
football
game
that
has
been
played
annually
for
more
than
a
century
.

Newcomerstown
is
a
village
in
Tuscarawas
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
east-northeast
of
Columbus
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
this
was
the
largest
Lenape
village
on
the
Tuscarawas
River
,
with
000
residents
.

Chief
Newcomer
(
Netawatwes
)
was
the
leader
of
the
western
Lenape
here
,
and
they
called
the
village
Gekelmukpechunk
.

Early
French
traders
and
English
settlers
named
the
village
Newcomerstown
after
the
chief
.

Soon
after
the
start
of
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
the
Lenape
moved
west
to
Coshocton
,
about
halfway
through
what
is
now
the
next
county
.

According
to
some
accounts
,
Newcomerstown
was
named
after
an
incident
that
occurred
between
a
Lenape
chief
and
his
wife
Mary
Harris
.

Chief
Eagle
Feather
grew
tired
of
his
wife
.

He
abducted
a
younger
squaw
as
a
second
wife
and
tried
to
have
Harris
accept
her
in
her
wigwam
.

Harris
allegedly
killed
Chief
Eagle
Feather
and
told
the
warriors
of
the
village
that
the
young
squaw
ran
away
.

The
warriors
hunted
the
young
woman
down
and
killed
her
.

The
settlement
was
thenceforth
known
as
"
Newcomerstown
"
,
after
the
squaw
.

Zoar
is
a
village
in
Tuscarawas
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Zoar
was
founded
by
German
religious
dissenters
called
the
Society
of
Separatists
of
Zoar
in
0000
.

It
was
a
communal
society
,
with
many
German-style
structures
that
have
been
restored
and
are
part
of
the
Zoar
Village
State
Memorial
.

There
are
presently
ten
restored
buildings
.

According
to
the
Ohio
Historical
Society
,
Zoar
is
an
island
of
Old-World
charm
in
east-central
Ohio
.

The
Separatists
,
or
Zoarites
,
emigrated
from
the
kingdom
of
Württemberg
in
southwestern
Germany
due
to
religious
oppression
from
the
Lutheran
church
.

Leading
among
their
group
were
some
natives
of
Rottenacker
on
the
Danube
.

Having
separated
from
the
established
church
,
their
theology
was
based
in
part
on
the
writings
of
Jakob
Böhme
.

They
did
not
practice
baptism
or
confirmation
and
did
not
celebrate
religious
holidays
except
for
the
Sabbath
.

A
central
flower
garden
in
Zoar
is
based
on
the
Book
of
Revelation
with
a
towering
tree
in
the
middle
representing
Christ
and
other
elements
surrounding
it
representing
other
allegorical
elements
.

The
leader
of
the
society
was
named
Joseph
Bimeler
(
also
known
as
Joseph
Bäumler
or
Bäumeler
,
born
0000
)
,
a
pipemaker
as
well
as
teacher
from
Ulm
.

His
charismatic
leadership
carried
the
village
through
a
number
of
crises
.

An
early
event
critical
to
the
success
of
the
colony
was
the
digging
of
the
Ohio
and
Erie
Canal
.

The
Zoarites
had
purchased
of
land
sight
unseen
and
used
loans
to
pay
for
it
.

The
loans
were
to
be
paid
off
by
0000
.

The
Society
struggled
for
many
years
to
determine
what
products
and
services
they
could
produce
in
their
village
to
pay
off
the
loans
.

The
state
of
Ohio
required
some
of
the
Zoarite
land
to
be
used
as
a
right
of
way
and
offered
the
Zoarites
an
opportunity
to
assist
in
digging
the
canals
for
money
.

The
state
gave
them
a
choice
of
digging
it
themselves
for
pay
or
having
the
state
pay
others
to
dig
the
canal
.

The
Zoarites
then
spent
several
years
in
the
0000s
digging
the
canal
and
thus
were
able
to
pay
off
their
loans
on
time
with
much
money
to
spare
.

Bimeler
's
death
on
August
00
,
0000
led
to
a
slow
decline
in
the
cohesion
of
the
village
.

By
0000
,
the
village
voted
to
disband
the
communal
society
and
the
property
was
divided
among
the
remaining
residents
.

Flooding
threat
The
future
of

village
is
threatened
because
a
Tuscarawas
River
levee
that
protects
the
village
has
been
given
the
lowest
safety
rating
by
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
.

The
village
sits
at
the
base
of
the
levee
,
which
was
built
by
the
Corps
in
0000
as
part
of
its
water
management
program
in
the
region
.

With
the
levee
in
failing
condition
,
the
Corps
is
evaluating
three
alternatives
:
The
Zoar
Village
Government
and
the
Zoar
Community
Association
are
working
to
preserve
the
Village
where
it
stands
and
have
created
the
Save
Historic
Zoar
Association
.

Initial
corps
estimates
,
as
of
mid-0000
,
put
the
cost
of
repairing
the
levee
at
about
$
000
million
,
slightly
less
than
$
0
million
per
resident
.

In
June
0000
the
National
Trust
for
Historic
Preservation
placed
Zoar
on
its
list
of
eleven
most
endangered
historic
places
.

History
Magnetic

.

Word
spread
across
the
country
of
these

;
even
foreigners
appeared
occasionally
.

Hotel

sprang
up
,
and
the
village
boomed
.

Following
the
discovery
of
modern
medicinal
cures
,
including
the
vaccine
for
polio
,
the
interest
in
natural
healing
remedies
faded
,
and
the
city
's
tourism
industry
collapsed
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
the
hotel
resorts
had
been
torn
down
.

During
the
Prohibition
era
of
the
0000s
,
the
village
was
a
local
hotbed
of
bootlegging
and
gambling
,
although
it
faced
vigorous
opposition
from
the
mayor
,
Mary
McFadden
.

She
also
led
bond
raising
campaigns
for
a
public
services
and
a
larger
town
hall
,
and
to
encourage
full
council
meetings
she
cooked
dinner
for
all

Origins
Marysville

within

territory
,
and
eventually
became
part

.

One
of

was
James
Galloway
,
Jr.
,
who

.

Marysville
was
founded
in

by
Samuel
W.

,
who
named
the
town
after
his
daughter
Mary
,
along
the
small

of
Mill
Creek
.

County
seat
designation
After
the
organization
of
the
county
by
the
Ohio
Legislature
,
Marysville
was
designated
as
the
seat
of
Union
County
.

The
first
recorded
meeting
of
the
commissioners
was
in
0000
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,

constructed
.

Eventually
a

,
dedicated

,
0000
.

This
is
the
present
courthouse
today
.

In
0000
,
a
county
was
authorized
.

The
first
county
jail
was
a
log
structure
that
sat
on
the
southside
of
East
Center
street
,
in
the
rear
of
the
courthouse
.

Eventually
a
new
jail
was
authorized
by
the
commissioners
and
built
in
the
0000s
.

In
0000
the
county
purchased
a
00-ton
safe

moved
into

.

The
first
county
fair
was
held
in

fair
to

location
,
on

northside
of
town
.

The
Bible

made
by
Abraham

,
of
Swiss
descent
,
in
0000
,
two
miles
north

the
city
.

Today
the

leading
to
the
high

is
named

Rd.
.

In
0000
,
the
first
post

established
.

At
this
time
,
there

only
four
families
in
the
village
.

In
0000
,
a
log
cabin
on
the
east
side
of
town
was
the
first
school
.

By
0000
,
there
were
three
schools
.

In
0000
,
the
first
high
school
was
opened
by
Caroline
Humphrey
,
and
by
0000
there
was
a
Board
of
Education
making
annual
reports
to
the
voters
.

In
0000
,
the
Ohio

published
that

History
The
town
is
located
in
an
area
originally
known
as
the
Black
Swamp
.

Early
pioneers
had
to
deal
with
swampy
ground
,
mud
,
and
malaria
.

They
persevered
,
draining
the
swamp
for
agriculture
and
eventually
reclaiming
enough
dry
land
to
establish
the
town
.

Van
Wert
was
the
birthplace
of
aviation
pioneer
Walter
Hinton
.

At
one
point
,
Van
Wert
was
the
only
place
in
the
world
producing
Liederkranz
cheese
.

This
pungent
dairy
product
was
made
at
the
now-closed
Borden
plant
.

Van
Wert
produces
many
famous
and
prestigious
Fried
dough
flavors
,
with
many
being
guarded
family
secrets
passed
down
from
generations
.

The
people
of
Van
Wert
(
000
of
which
called
themselves
"
Cheesemakers
"
)
contributed
to
the
town
of
Vimoutiers
,
Orne
,
Lower
Normandy
,
France
with
help
in
the
costs
of
reconstruction
and
reparation
of
the
town
after
it
was
mistakenly
bombed
by
the
US
Air
Force
during
World
War
II
.

They
volunteered
to
pay
for
the
replacement
of
Marie
Harel
's
statue
.

This
is
recorded
by
a
plaque
in
the
market
square
of
Vimoutiers
.

Vimoutiers
is
a
centre
for
local
making
of
Camembert
,
Livarot
and
Pont
l'Eveque
cheeses
.

On
November
00
,
0000

Day
Weekend
Outbreak

's
emergency
warning
system

that
had
been
packed
with
people
just

A
churl
(
etymologically
the
same
name
as
Charles
/
Carl
and
Old
High
German
karal
)
,
in
its
earliest
Old
English
(
Anglo-Saxon
)
meaning
,
was
simply
"
a
man
"
,
but
the
word
soon
came
to
mean
"
a
non-servile
peasant
"
,
still
spelled
ċeorl
(
e
)
,
and
denoting
the
lowest
rank
of
freemen
.

According
to
the
Oxford
English
Dictionary
it
later
came
to
mean
the
opposite
of
the
nobility
and
royalty
,
"
a
common
person
"
.

Says
Chadwick
:
This
meaning
held
through
the
00th
century
,
but
by
then
the
word
had
taken
on
negative
overtone
,
meaning
"
a
country
person
"
and
then
"
a
low
fellow
"
.

By
the
00th
century
,
a
new
and
pejorative
meaning
arose
,
"
one
inclined
to
uncivil
or
loutish
behaviour
"
(
cf.
the
pejorative
sense
of
the
term
boor
,
whose
original
meaning
of
"
country
person
"
or
"
farmer
"
is
preserved
in
Dutch
and
Afrikaans
boer
and
German
Bauer
,
although
the
latter
has
its
own
pejorative
connotations
such
as
those
prompting
its
use
as
the
name
for
the
chess
piece
known
in
English
as
a
pawn
)
.

The
ċeorles
of
Anglo-Saxon
times
lived
in
a
largely
free
society
,
and
one
in
which
their
fealty
was
principally
to
their
king
.

Their
low
status
is
shown
by
their
werġild
(
"
man-price
"
)
,
which
over
a
large
part
of
England
was
fixed
at
000
shillings
(
one-sixth
that
of
a
theġn
)
.

Agriculture
was
largely
community-based
and
communal
in
open-field
systems
.

This
freedom
was
eventually
eroded
by
the
increase
in
power
of
feudal
lords
and
the
manorial
system
.

Some
scholars
argue
however
that
anterior
to
the
encroachment
of
the
manorial
system
the
ċeorles
owed
various
services
and
rents
to
local
lords
and
powers
.

In
the
North
Germanic
(
Scandinavian
)
languages
,
the
word
Karl
has
the
same
root
as
churl
and
meant
originally
a
"
free
man
"
.

As
Housecarl
,
it
came
back
to
England
.

In
German
,
Kerl
is
used
to
describe
a
somewhat
rough
and
common
man
and
is
no
longer
in
use
as
a
synonym
for
a
common
soldier
(
die
langen
Kerls
of
Frederick
the
Great
of
Prussia
)
.

Rígsþula
,
a
poem
in
the
Poetic
Edda
,
explains
the
social
class
es
as
originating
from
the
three
sons
of
Ríg
:
Thrall
,
Karl
and
Earl
(
Þræl
,
Karl
and
Jarl
)
.

This
story
has
been
interpreted
in
the
context
of
the
proposed
trifunctional
hypothesis
of
Proto-Indo-European
society
.

Cognates
to
the
word
ceorle
are
frequently
found
in
place
names
,
throughout
the
Anglophone
world
,
in
towns
such
as
Carlton
and
Charlton
,
meaning
"
the
farm
of
the
churls
"
.

Names
such
as
Carl
and
Charles
are
derived
from
cognates
of
churl
or
ċeorle
.

While
the
word
churl
went
down
in
the
social
scale
,
the
first
name
derived
from
the
same
etymological
source
(
"
Karl
"
in
German
,
"
Charles
"
in
French
and
English
,
"
Carlos
"
in
Spanish
etc.
)
remained
prestigious
enough
to
be
used
frequently
by
many
European
royal
families
-
owing
originally
to
the
fame
of
Charlemagne
,
to
which
was
added
that
of
later
illustrious
kings
and
emperors
of
the
same
name
.

Król
,
the
Polish
word
for
"
king
"
,
is
also
derived
from
the
same
origin
.

Current
use
In
most
Germanic
languages
this
word
did
not
take
on
the
English
meaning
of
"
lowly
peasant
"
and
retains
its
original
meaning
of
"
fellow

Harveysburg
is
a
village
in
Massie
Township
,
Warren
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
best
known
as
the
home
of
the
Ohio
Renaissance
Festival
.

History
Established
in
0000
in
Harveysburg
,
the
Harveysburg
Free
Black
School
was
the
first
free
school
for
African-American
children
in
Ohio
.

Quakers
Jesse
and
Elizabeth
Harvey
founded
the
school
.

Like
most
Quakers
,
the
Harveys
believed
strongly
in
education
.

They
also
believed
in
equal
opportunity
for
African
Americans
with
whites
.

Elizabeth
Harvey
was
especially
concerned
about
the
lack
of
free
education
for
Ohio
's
African-American
children
and
convinced
her
husband
to
construct
a
one-room
schoolhouse
to
assist
black
children
in
attaining
an
education
.

While
the
institution
is
now
known
as
the
Harveysburg
Free
Black
School
,
the
school
permitted
any
children
of
color
to
attend
.

Constructed
of
brick
,
the
Harveysburg
Free
Black
School
remained
in
operation
as
a
school
until
the
early
0000s
,
when
African-Americans
were
finally
permitted
to
attend
historically
white
schools
in
the
community
.

The
school
relied
on
donations
,
principally
from
the
Grove
Monthly
Meeting
of
Friends
in
Harveysburg
,
to
remain
open
.

In
addition
to
opening
the
Harveysburg
Free
Black
School
,
the
couple
also
established
a
seminary
for
white
children
in
the
community
Upon
the
school
's
closing
,
the
building
became
a
private
home
.

In
0000
,
the
Harveysburg
Bicentennial
Committee
acquired
the
building
and
restored
it
to
its
original
appearance
.

Black

The
Quaker
village
of
Harveysburg
was
founded
in
0000
on
land
originally
a
part
of
Colonel
Abraham
Buford
's
Revolutionary
War
Land
Grant
.

Levi
Lukens
,
a
Virginia
Quaker
,
purchased
the
0000
-
acre
survey
in
0000
and
sold
a
portion
to
Rhoden
Ham
in
0000
.

Ham
then
sold
a
portion
of
his
holdings
to
William
Harvey
,
a
Quaker
originally
from
North
Carolina
,
who
developed
00
lots
for
a
village
which
thrived
from
its
beginnings
.

Early
businesses
included
grist
mills
,
a
tin
shop
,
hardware
store
,
blacksmith
shop
,
a
large
pork
packing
plant
,
a
bank
,
and
a
dry
goods
store
owned
by
William
Harvey
.

Its
first
post
office
opened
in
0000
.

Harveysburg
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

The
village
received
its
name
from
a
merchant
in
Cincinnati
who
told
William
Harvey
that
he
should
add
burg
to
his
name
and
call
the
place
Harveysburg

The

In
Harveysburg
's
early

Elizabeth
Harvey
,
wife
of
Dr.
Jesse
Harvey
,
recognized
the
need
to
educate
African
American
and
Native
American
children
in
the
area
.

The
Harveys
built
the
Harverysburg
School
in
0000
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
schools
for
such
minority
children
in
Ohio
and
the
Northwest
Territory
.

It
was
supported
by
the
Harveys
and
members
of
the
Grove
Monthly
Meeting
of
Friends
.

Stephen
Wall
,
a
wealthy
North
Carolina
plantation
owner
,
provided
funding
to
relocate
eight
slave
children
and
their
families
to
Harveysburg
for
their
education
at
this
school
.

Orindatus
S.B.
Wall

son
of
Steven
became
the

commissioned
African
American
captain

closed
in

the

Services
Lebanon
lies

within

telephone
exchange

but
parts
are
in

Mason

South
Lebanon
exchanges
.

Local
and
long

telephony
services
for
the
city
are
primarily
provided
by
CenturyLink
(
formerly
Embarq
,
Sprint
's
local
telephony
division
)
and
Cincinnati
Bell
.

The
city
is
one
of
the
handful
in
the
nation
that
used
to
operate
a
government-run
cable
television
and
telephone
service
,
as
well
as
being
a
fiber-to-the-neighborhood
Internet
service
provider
.

Controversial
since
it
began
operation
in
0000
,
the
Lebanon
telecommunications
system
had
struggled
to
recover
its
expenses
and
had
accumulated
over
$
0
million
in
debt
.

However
,
residents
in
the
area
,
at
the
time
,
paid
up
to
00
%
less
for
the
aforementioned
services
than
neighboring
communities
,
therefore
saving
over
$
00
million
of
the
resident
's
money
.

In
the
0000
general
election
,
however
,
voters
approved
the
sale
of
this
city-run
telecommunications
system
to
Cincinnati
Bell

History
On
June
0
,
0000
,
Revolutionary
War
veteran
William
Mason
paid
$
0,000
at
auction
to
purchase
of
land
in
what
is
now
downtown
Mason
.

In
0000
,
he
platted
00
lots
on
this
land
and
named
the
village
"
Palmira
.
"

In
0000
,
two
years
after
the
death
of
William
Mason
and
according
to
his
will
,
more
than
00
additional
lots
were
platted
on
the
north
,
south
,
and
west
of
Palmira
.

When
the
plat
was
officially
recorded
,
the
name
of
the
village
was
listed
as
"
Palmyra
.
"

In
0000
,
a
petition
was
sent
to
the
federal
post
office
to
correct
the
name
of
the
town
.

It
had
been
listed
as
Kirkwood
,
possibly
an
error
because
the
postmaster
at
the
time
was
William
Kirkwood
.

When
village
officials
were
informed
that
there
was
another
Palmyra
in
Ohio
,
the
name
was
officially
changed
to
"
Mason
.

Early
history
Waynesville
was
founded
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Little
Miami
River
in
0000
by
Samuel
Heighway
on
land
he
purchased
from
Judge
John
Cleves
Symmes
.

The
area
was
in
the
Northwest
Territory
until
Ohio
achieved
statehood
in
0000
.

General
“
Mad
”
Anthony
Wayne
opened
the
land
for
settlement
through
the
Treaty
of
Greenville
;
appropriately
,
Waynesville
was
named
for
him
.

Heighway
plat
ted
Waynesville
in
the
fashion
of
an
English
village
,
laying
the
town
out
in
twelve
squares
of
four
acres
each
.

The
squares
retain
their
names
today
,
as
noted
by
sign
posts
on
each
corner
.

Waynesville
has
significance
as
an
important
Quaker
settlement
.

The
Miami
Monthly
Meeting
,
established
in
0000
as
the
first
such
gathering
in
southwestern
Ohio
,
is
located
here
.

Early
homes
were
built
of
logs
and
later
mostly
of
frame
,
as
wood
was
plentiful
while
bricks
had
to
be
made
on
site
.

The
Accommodation
Stage
Coach
Line
ran
along
Third
Street
,
which
was
the
major
road
of
that
time
,
and
Waynesville
was
the
halfway
point
between
Springfield
and
Cincinnati
,
Ohio
.

In
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
Main
Street
became
the
center
of
Waynesville
's
commercial
activity
.

Currently
,
the
Village
of
Waynesville
has
over
000
historic
buildings
that
are
still
in
existence
.

Most
of
these
properties
are
in
the
older
section
of
town
,
which
includes
Main
Street
,
Third
Street
,
Fourth
Street
,
and
parts
of
Fifth

Belpre
is
a
city
in
Washington
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
along
the
Ohio
River
.

The
town
was
originally
named
Belle
Prairie
or
"
Beautiful
Prairie
.
"

Part
of
the
Parkersburg
-
Marietta
-
Vienna
,
WV
-
OH
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
,
it
is
located
about
00
miles
downriver
from
Marietta
.

In
0000
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
completed
the
Parkersburg
Bridge
(
CSX
)
across
the
river
;
at
,
it
was
reportedly
the
longest
in
the
world
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Belpre
was
the
second
United
States
settlement
in
the
Northwest
Territory
after
Marietta
.

The
city
is
home
to
the
first
library
established
in
the
Territory
.

Its
public
school
hired
the
first
female
schoolteacher
in
Ohio
.

History
In
0000
railroad
developers
in
0000
founded
the
Belpre
and
Cincinnati
Railroad
,
but
the
destination
was
changed
to
Marietta
,
with
a
corresponding
name
change
in
0000
.

For
a
considerable
time
,
travelers
had
to
go
by
steamboat
to
connect
between
Marietta
to
Parkersburg
,
Virginia
,
which
received
service
from
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
in
0000
.

This
was
shortly
before
the
western
part
of
the
state
seceded
to
form
West
Virginia
in
0000
.

Belpre
and
Marietta
were
later
connected
by
rail
.

Coal
service
is
still
active
on
this
line
.

From
0000-0000
,
the
B&O
built
the
Parkersburg
Bridge
(
CSX
)
between
West
Virginia
and
Belpre
,
on
its
main
line
to
St.
Louis
,
Missouri
.

Designed
by
Jacob
Linville
,
when
completed
in
0000
,
the
bridge
was
reportedly
the
longest
in
the
world
at
.

This
brought
more
trade
to
the
town
,
provided
for
shipping
Ohio
coal
to
the
East
Coast
,
and
improved
access
on
both
sides
of
the
river
.

Developing
in
a
different
pattern
from
the
more
industrial
cities
of
eastern
Ohio
,
Belpre
reached
its
peak
of
population
in
0000
.

It
has
had
some
loss
since
then
,
but
is
relatively
stable
compared
to
the
former
industrial
cities
,
which
have
lost
half
their
residents
since
peaks
in
0000
and
0000
.

The
Steven
Soderbergh
film
Bubble
(

Lowell
is
a
village
in
Washington
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
along
the
Muskingum
River
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
first
European
settlers
to
the
land
that
would
become
Lowell
arrived
in
the
late
00th
century
after
the
0000
Northwest
Ordinance
opened
the
territory
for
settlement
.

Soon
after
the
Ordinance
took
effect
,
the
Ohio
Company
of
Associates
purchased
of
land
along
the
Muskingum
River
and
proceeded
to
survey
the
area
.

The
first
settlement
in
what
would
become
the
state
of
Ohio
was
Marietta
,
founded
in
0000
near
the
mouth
of
the
Muskingum
about
downstream
from
the
site
that
would
become
Lowell
.

By
0000
,
settlement
had
spread
north
to
the
area
where
the
Cats
Creek
enters
the
Muskingum
River
.

By
the
0000s
the
Muskingum
Valley
had
long
been
settled
,
and
local
leaders
created
a
plan
to
improve
the
Muskingum
River
for
use
as
a
source
of
power
.

In
0000
the
State
Legislature
approved
a
bill
that
appropriated
$
000,000
to
create
a
series
of
locks
and
dams
along
the
river
as
far
north
as
Dresden
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
eleven
dams
and
twelve
locks
were
built
at
a
cost
that
had
ballooned
to
over
$
0.0
million
.

The
third
lock
was
built
within
a
one
mile
(
0.0
km
)
long
canal
constructed
near
the
mouth
of
the
Cats
Creek
to
bypass
a
series
of
rapids
in
the
Muskingum
.

Two
competing
companies
bought
land
near
the
canal
with
the
intentions
of
building
a
town
.

The
first
settlement
was
laid
out
on
November
0
,
0000
and
was
named
Lowell
with
the
idea
that
it
would
grow
into
a
large
manufacturing
city
similar
to
Lowell
,
Massachusetts
.

It
was
located
along
the
upper
end
of
the
canal
on
the
west
side
of
the
Cats
Creek
.

The
second
settlement
,
called
Buell
's
Lowell
,
was
laid
out
on
March
00
,
0000
.

The
second
settlement
quickly
grew
to
dominate
to
the
point
that
the
first
settlement
became
known
as
Upper
Lowell
.

In
0000
,
Buell
's
Lowell
was
incorporated
as
a
village
and
in
0000
officially
changed
its
name
to
Lowell
.

During
the
second
half
the
00th
century
several
mills
,
tanneries
,
and
factories
were
built
along
the
canal
.

In
0000
the
Zanesville
and
Ohio
River
Railroad
was
constructed
across
the
river
from
Lowell
giving
the
small
village
rail
access
to
Zanesville
in
the
north
and
Marietta
in
the
south
.

By
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
,
Lowell
's
fortunes
began
to
decline
as
river
trade
was
replaced
by
the
railroads
and
later
automobiles
.

Industry
in
the
city
declined
and
much
of
the
land
along
the
canal
has
since
been
replaced
by
parkland
.

Today
many
Lowell
residents
rely
on
Parkersburg
and
Marietta
for
jobs
and
shopping
.

On
November
0
,
0000
,
Dave
Pitzer
was
elected
Mayor
in
a
000-00
landslide
defeating
Douglas
Seese
.

Marietta
is
a
city
in
and
the
county
seat
of
Washington
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

During
0000
,
pioneers
to
the
Ohio
Country
established
Marietta
as
the
first
permanent
settlement
of
the
new
United
States
in
the
Territory
Northwest
of
the
River
Ohio
.

Marietta
is
located
in
southeastern
Ohio
at
the
mouth
of
the
Muskingum
River
at
its
confluence
with
the
Ohio
River
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
second-largest
city
in
the
Parkersburg
-
Marietta
-
Vienna
,
West
Virginia
-
Ohio
(
part
)
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
private
,
nonsectarian
liberal
arts
Marietta
College
is
located
here
.

It
was
a
station
on
the
Underground
Railroad
before
the
Civil
War
.

This
is
the
site
of
the
prehistoric
Marietta
Earthworks
,
a
Hopewell
complex
more
than
0000
years
old
,
whose
Great
Mound
and
other
major
monuments
were
preserved
by
the
earliest
United
States
settlers
in
parks
such
as
the
Mound
Cemetery
.

History
Prehistoric
Succeeding
cultures
of
indigenous
peoples
have
lived
along
the
Ohio
River
and
its
tributaries
for
thousands
of
years
.

Among
them
were
more
than
one
culture
who
built
earthwork
mounds
,
monuments
which
generally
expressed
their
cosmology
,
often
with
links
to
astronomical
events
.

Between
000
BC
and
000
AD
,
the
Hopewell
culture
built
the
multi-earthwork
complex
on
the
terrace
east
of
the
Muskingum
River
near
its
mouth
with
the
Ohio
.

It
is
now
known
as
the
Marietta
Earthworks
.

Developed
over
many
years
,
it
had
a
large
enclosed
square
,
within
which
were
four
platform
mounds
,
used
for
ceremonial
purposes
and
elite
residential
;
another
square
,
and
a
larger
conical
mound
used
for
burials
.

A
walled
,
graded
path
led
to
the
river
's
edge
.

By
the
time
of
the
historic
tribes
,
such
as
the
Shawnee
,
the
purposes
and
makers
of
the
monuments
were
no
longer
known
.

Settlement
In
0000
,
the
future
U.S.
president
George
Washington
,
then
a
surveyor
,
began
exploring
large
tracts
of
land
west
of
his
native
Virginia
.

During
the
Revolutionary
War
,
Washington
told
his
friend
General
Rufus
Putnam
of
the
beauty
he
had
seen
in
his
travels
through
the
Ohio
Valley
and
of
his
ideas
for
settling
the
territory
.

In
the
summer
of
0000
,
John
Carpenter
built
Carpenter
's
Fort
or
Carpenter
's
Station
as
it
was
sometimes
called
,
a
fortified
house
above
the
mouth
of
Short
Creek
on
the
Ohio
side
of
the
Ohio
River
,
near
present
day
Marietta
.

After
the
war
,
the
newly
formed
United
States
had
little
cash
but
plenty
of
natural
resources
.

Eager
to
develop
additional
lands
,
the
new
government
decided
to
pay
veterans
of
the
Revolution
with
warrants
for
land
in
the
Northwest
Territory
,
which
was
organized
under
federal
authority
in
0000
by
the
Northwest
Ordinance
.

Competing
states
had
agreed
to
end
their
claims
to
the
lands
;
Pennsylvania
and
Virginia
received
some
lands
.

Arthur
St.
Clair
was
appointed
by
the
president
as
governor
of
the
new
territory
.

The
Ohio
Company
of
Associates
had
supported
provisions
in
the
ordinance
to
allow
veterans
to
use
their
warrants
to
purchase
the
land
.

They
bought
0.0
million
acres
(
0,000
km
²
)
of
land
from
Congress
.

On
April
0
,
0000
,
00
men
of
the
Ohio
Company
of
Associates
,
led
by
General
Putnam
,
arrived
at
the
confluence
of
the
Muskingum
and
Ohio
rivers
.

The
site
was
on
the
east
side
of
the
Muskingum
River
,
across
from
Fort
Harmar
,
a
military
outpost
built
three
years
prior
.

Bringing
with
them
the
first
government
sanctioned
by
the
US
for
this
area
,
they
established
the
first
permanent
United
States
settlement
in
the
Northwest
Territory
.

They
named
Marietta
in
honor
of
Marie
Antoinette
,
the
Queen
of
France
,
who
had
aided
the
colonies
in
their
battle
for
independence
from
Great
Britain
.

The
Native
Americans
were
unhappy
to
see
white
settlers
moving
into
their
territory
.

The
latter
immediately
started
construction
of
two
forts
:
Campus
Martius
,
whose
former
site
is
now
occupied
by
the
museum
of
the
same
name
,
and
Picketed
Point
Stockade
,
at
the
confluence
of
the
Muskingum
and
Ohio
rivers
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
settlers
started
developing
their
community
,
platted
according
to
plans
they
had
made
in
Boston
.

In
0000
,
George
Washington
said
,
"
No
colony
in
America
was
ever
settled
under
such
favorable
auspices
as
that
which
has
just
commenced
at
the
Muskingum
...
If
I
was
a
young
man
,
just
preparing
to
begin
the
world
,
or
if
advanced
in
life
and
had
a
family
to
make
provision
for
,
I
know
of
no
country
where
I
should
rather
fix
my
habitation
...
"
.

The
families
of
the
settlers
began
arriving
within
a
few
months
.

By
the
end
of
0000
,
000
people
populated
the
area
.

In
0000
,
the
United
States
signed
the
Treaty
of
Fort
Harmar
with
several
Native
American
nations
who
occupied
areas
of
the
Northwest
Territory
,
to
settle
issues
related
to
trade
,
and
the
boundary
between
their
lands
and
United
States
settlement
.

The
US
did
not
address
the
Native
Americans
'
major
grievance
about
European-American
settlers
moving
into
their
lands
,
particularly
in
the
Western
Reserve
,
where
there
were
disputes
over
land
.

Although
Congress
authorized
Governor
Arthur
St.
Clair
to
give
land
back
to
the
Indians
,
he
did
not
do
so
.

Conflict
increased
as
the
Native
American
tried
to
push
the
settlers
out
.

After
years
of
warfare
in
the
region
,
they
were
defeated
.

The
US
signed
the
Treaty
of
Greenville
(
0000
)
with
the
Native
Americans
,
which
secured
the
safety
of
settlers
to
leave
the
forts
and
develop
their
farms
.

The
settlers
held
services
regularly
and
chartered
the
first
church
in
0000
.

It
was
a
Congregational
institution
;
its
charter
was
unusually
inclusive
due
to
the
varied
religious
backgrounds
of
its
members
.

The
congregation
constructed
the
first
church
building
in
0000
.

Education
was
important
to
the
settlers
,
many
of
whom
had
been
officers
during
the
Revolution
.

During
that
first
winter
,
they
began
a
basic
school
for
the
children
at
Campus
Martius
.

In
0000
,
settlers
founded
Muskingum
Academy
.

The
town
had
numerous
abolitionist
s
,
and
Ephraim
Cutler
was
instrumental
as
a
state
delegate
in
0000
at
the
state
convention
in
swaying
the
vote
for
the
state
to
be
free
of
slavery
.

00th
century
Townspeople
organized
and
chartered
Marietta
College
in
0000
.

It
was
used
as
a
station
on
the
Underground
Railroad
to
help
slaves
escape
from
the
South
.

The
University
of
Ohio
was
founded
earlier
elsewhere
in
the
territory
,
on
land
reserved
for
public
education
under
the
Northwest
Ordinance
.

The
settlers
preserved
the
Great
Mound
,
or
Conus
,
by
planning
their
own
cemetery
around
it
.

They
also
preserved
two
largest
platform
mounds
,
which
they
called
Capitolinus
and
Quadrophenus
.

The
former
has
been
used
as
the
site
for
the
library
.

The
Mound
Cemetery
has
the
highest
number
of
burials
of
Revolutionary
War
officers
,
indicating
the
nature
of
the
generation
that
settled
Marietta
.

Marietta
's
location
on
two
major
navigable
rivers
made
it
ideal
for
industry
and
commerce
.

Boat
building
was
one
of
the
early
industries
.

Artisans
built
oceangoing
vessels
and
sailed
them
downriver
to
the
Mississippi
and
south
to
New
Orleans
and
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.

In
less
than
two
decades
after
settlement
,
the
steamboat
had
been
developed
,
and
was
also
constructed
here
.

Brick
factories
and
sawmill
s
supplied
materials
for
homes
and
public
buildings
.

An
iron
mill
,
along
with
several
foundries
,
provided
rails
for
the
railroad
industry
;
the
Marietta
Chair
Factory
made
furniture
.

Interest
in
the
prehistoric
culture
that
built
the
Marietta
Earthworks
continued
.

The
complex
was
surveyed
and
drawn
by
Ephraim
George
Squier
and
Edwin
Hamilton
Davis
,
whose
large
project
on
numerous
prehistoric
mounds
was
published
by
the
Smithsonian
Institution
in
0000
as
Ancient
Monuments
of
the
Mississippi
Valley
.

It
was
the
first
book
published
by
the
Smithsonian
.

Their
drawing
to
the
right
shows
the
plan
of
the
original
complex
,
which
"
included
a
large
square
enclosure
surrounding
four
flat-topped
pyramidal
mounds
,
another
smaller
square
,
and
a
circular
enclosure
with
a
large
burial
mound
at
its
center
.
"

The
walled
,
graded
path
,
called
by
the
settlers
the
Sacra
Via
,
led
from
the
largest
enclosure
to
the
lower
river
's
edge
.

This
was
destroyed
in
0000
during
mid-nineteenth
century
development
.

Railroads
and
oil
Local
development
began
with
the
Belpre
and
Cincinnati
Railroad
(
B&C
)
;
it
was
founded
in
0000
.

It
was
intended
to
connect
from
Belpre
,
Ohio
,
the
next
town
downriver
,
to
a
planned
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
(
B&O
)
spur
to
Parkersburg
.

But
,
for
years
,
the
Virginia
government
did
not
allow
the
B&O
to
construct
track
south
of
Wheeling
.

In
0000
developers
changed
the
Ohio
state
terminus
to
Marietta
and
changed
the
name
of
the
railroad
to
the
Marietta
and
Cincinnati
Railroad
that
year
.

The
right-of-way
for
an
alternate
connection
to
the
B&O
extended
upriver
from
Marietta
to
Bellaire
,
Ohio
.

The
M&C
was
bankrupt
by
0000
,
but
construction
of
track
continued
west
to
reach
Cincinnati
.

The
first
through-train
from
Cincinnati
ran
on
April
0
,
0000
.

The
M&C
got
out
of
bankruptcy
in
0000
.

The
railroad
was
never
constructed
upriver
from
Marietta
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
(
PRR
)
in
its
expansion
later
purchased
the
right-of-way
between
Marietta
and
Bellaire
.

Passengers
traveling
between
Marietta
and
Parkersburg
,
Virginia
had
to
take
a
steamboat
for
the
00
miles
between
them
and
transfer
.

With
help
from
the
B&O
and
the
Baltimore
City
Council
,
the
Union
Railroad
finally
connected
Marietta
to
Belpre
,
Ohio
in
0000
.

Later
absorbed
by
the
B&O
,
this
section
of
track
is
still
in
operation
(
0000
)
,
with
unit
coal
trains
providing
most
of
the
traffic
.

The
planned
bridge
from
Parkersburg
across
the
Ohio
River
to
Belpre
was
finally
built
0000-0000
by
the
B&O
,
as
part
of
its
main
line
from
Baltimore
to
St.
Louis
,
Missouri
.

This
cut
Marietta
off
from
traffic
and
trade
,
although
it
retained
local
and
Ohio
service
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
Marietta
was
served
by
00
passenger
trains
a
day
,
most
of
which
ran
on
the
PRR
tracks
.

William
P.
Cutler
was
a
major
figure
in
the
M&C
.

He
also
backed
the
Union
Railroad
and
the
Marietta
,
Columbus
and
Cleveland
Railroad
,
among
other
local
railroads
.

Cutler
served
as
General
Manager
and
as
President
of
the
M&C
for
many
years
.

In
0000
,
oil
was
first
drilled
in
the
Marietta
region
.

Oil
booms
in
0000
and
0000
made
investors
rich
,
leading
to
the
construction
of
numerous
lavish
houses
in
the
town
,
of
which
many
still
stand
.

The
Dawes
brothers
of
Marietta
founded
the
Pure
Oil
Company
.

All
four
brothers
became
nationally
prominent
businessmen
and/or
politicians
:
Charles
Gates
Dawes
,
Rufus
C.
Dawes
,
Beman
Gates
Dawes
and
Henry
May
Dawes
.

Charles
Dawes
was
elected
in
0000
with
President
Calvin
Coolidge
to
serve
as
the
00th
Vice
President
of
the
United
States
(
0000-0000
)
.

In
0000
he
shared
the
Nobel
Peace
Prize
,
based
on
his
work
on
the
Dawes
Plan
and
relieving
an
international
crisis
in
0000
related
to
German
reparations
after
World
War
I
.

In
0000
,
the
first
Putnam
Street
Bridge
was
opened
to
connect
Marietta
to
Fort
Harmar
.

It
provided
the
first
free
crossing
of
the
Muskingum
.

00th
century
to
present
As
transportation
advanced
,
Marietta
was
passed
by
.

From
0000-0000
,
the
B
&
O
Railroad
built
a
bridge
to
connect
Parkersburg
,
West
Virginia
and
Belpre
;
and
the
National
Road
went
further
north
through
Zanesville
.

Marietta
was
relatively
isolated
from
new
travel
routes
until
0000
,
when
I-00
was
opened
with
close
access
to
the
city
.

In
0000
,
the
Sons
and
Daughters
of
Pioneer
Rivermen
was
established
in
Marietta
during
the
Great
Depression
to
celebrate
the
city
's
substantial
river
history
and
its
people
.

Two
years
later
the
Ohio
River
Museum
was
opened
.

In
0000
,
the
museum
campus
was
totally
redesigned
.

lawyer
and
railroad
capitalist
John
Stryker
,
who
was
the
founder
of
the
Michigan
Southern
Railroad
Company
,
the

was
organized
on
March
00
,
0000
by
James
Guthrie
,
the
first
settler
in
the
township
and
in
the
county
.

James
settled
there
along
the
Tiffin
River
in
0000
.

The
community
continued
to
grow
and
by
0000
it
was
ranked
as
one
of
the
leading
agricultural
areas
in
the
United
States
.

The
village
of
Stryker
was
surveyed
on

,
0000
beside
the
proposed
Michigan
Southern
and

Indiana
Railroad
(
now
known
as

Bowling
Green
is
the
county
seat
of
Wood
County
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Ohio
.

At
the
time
of
the
0000
census
,
the
population
of
Bowling
Green
was
00,000
.

It
is
part
of
the
Toledo
,
Ohio
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

Bowling
Green
is
the
home
of
Bowling
Green
State
University
.

A
CSX
line
runs
through
town
.

History
Bowling
Green
was
first
settled
in
0000
,
was
incorporated
as
a
town
in
0000
,
and
became
a
city
in
0000
.

Bowling
Green
was
settled
by
the
families
of
Booth
,
Hartman
,
Hollington
,
Mackie
,
Manville
,
Martindale
,
Maule
,
Moore
,
Richards
,
Shively
,
St.
Johns
,
Stauffer
,
Thurstin
,
Tracy
,
and
Walker
.

With
the
discovery
of
oil
in
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
century
,
Bowling
Green
experienced
a
boom
.

The
wealth
can
still
be
seen
in
the
downtown
store
fronts
,
and
along
Wooster
Street
where
many
of
the
oldest
and
largest
homes
were
built
.

This
was
followed
by
an
expansion
of
the
automobile
industry
.

In
late
0000
or
early
0000
,
Coats
Steam
Car
moved
to
the
area
,
but
eventually
went
out
of
business
.

According
to
the
BGSU
library
and
an
exhaustive
study
by
a
History
Teaching
Fellow
,
the
0000s
brought
a
chapter
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
to
the
city
that
flourished
until
the
mid-0000s
.

The
film
Bowling
Green
This
is
Your
City
was
made
in
0000
and
tells
a
part
of
the
history
of
Bowling
Green
as
well
as
showing
the
viewer
around
the
town
.

Geography
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
city
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
,
is
land
and

.

Energy
policy
Bowling
Green
is
home
to
Ohio
's
first
utility-sized
wind
farm
.

In
total
,
Bowling
Green
is
home
to
four
turbines
that
are
each
000
feet
tall
.

These
turbines
generate
up
to
0.0
megawatts
of
power
,
which
is
enough
to
supply
electricity
for
some
0,000
residents
.

Located
about
six
miles
from
the
city
,
the
turbines
can
be
seen
for
miles
and
have
become
a
local
attraction
.

At
the
site
of
the
turbines
,
a
solar-powered
kiosk
provides
information
for
visitors
,
including
current
information
on
wind
speeds
and
the
amount
of
energy
being
produced
by
the
turbines
.

Through
the
city
's
Municipal
Utilities
office
,
residents
can
request
that
their
power
come
from
green
energy
.

The
current
power
cost
adjustment
is
$
.000
per
KWH
.

However
,
Bowling
Green
's
green
credentials
were
damaged
in
0000
,
when
the
city
signed
a
power
contract
with
AMP-Ohio
to
help
build
a
000-megawatt
coal-fired
power
plant
in
Meigs
County
,
Ohio
.

Several
large
environmental
groups
,
including
Sierra
Club
,
the
Natural
Resources
Defense
Council
,
and
the
Ohio
Environmental
Council
,
opposed
the
building
of
a
coal-fired
power
plant
due
to
the
pollution
it
would
cause
.

Other
Ohio
groups
,
including
Ohio
Citizen
Action
and
the
Ohio
Student
Environmental
Coalition
,
worked
actively
to
convince
municipalities
,
such
as
Bowling
Green
,
to
live
up
to
their
green
rhetoric
and
cancel
their
participation
in
the
plant
.

In
late
0000
,
AMP
canceled
the
project
,
citing
an
estimated
00
%
increase
in
cost
to
more
than
$
0
billion
.

William
Ernest
Powell
Giles
(
00
July
0000
–
00
November
0000
)
,
best
known
as
Ernest
Giles
,
was
an
Australian
explorer
who
led
three
major
expeditions
in
central
Australia
.

Early
life
Ernest
Giles
was
born
in
Bristol
,
England
,
son
of
William
Giles
,
a
merchant
,
and
Jane
Elizabeth
,
née
Powell
.

Giles
was
educated
at
Christ
's
Hospital
school
,
Newgate
,
London
.

At
the
age
of
00
,
he
emigrated
to
Australia
,
joining
his
parents
,
and
took
up
residence
in
Adelaide
,
South
Australia
.

In
0000
Giles
went
to
the
Victorian
goldfields
,
then
became
a
clerk
at
the
Post
Office
in
Melbourne
,
and
later
at
the
County
Court
.

Soon
tiring
of
town
life
Giles
went
to
the
back
country
and
obtained
valuable
experience
as
a
bushman
;
he
was
exploring
on
the
Darling
River
in
0000
,
looking
for
pastoral
country
.

He
was
searching
for
land
capable
of
cultivating
hemp
,
as
it
was
valuable
for
rope
at
the
time
.

Exploration
Giles
did
n't
attempt
a
regular
exploring
expedition
until
0000
,
when
with
two
other
men
he
left
Chambers
Pillar
,
South
Australia
(
now
in
the
Northern
Territory
)
,
around
the
middle
of
August
and
traversed
much
previously
untrodden
country
to
the
north-west
and
west
.

Finding
their
way
barred
by
Lake
Amadeus
and
that
their
horses
were
getting
very
weak
,
a
return
was
made
to
the
Finke
River
and
then
to
Charlotte
Waters
and
Adelaide
,
where
Giles
arrived
in
January
0000
.

Giles
looked
upon
his
expedition
as
a
failure
,
but
he
had
done
well
considering
the
size
and
equipment
of
his
party
.

Second
expedition
Giles
'
friend
Baron
von
Mueller
raised
a
subscription
so
that
a
new
expedition
could
be
made
.

The
services
of
William
Henry
Tietkins
as
first
assistant
was
obtained
,
and
with
two
other
men
a
start
was
made
on
0
August
0000
.

The
journey
began
considerably
south
from
the
previous
expedition
and
from
the
Alberga
River
a
generally
western
course
was
traversed
.

A
month
later
in
the
Musgrave
Ranges
a
fine
running
river
was
found
and
named
the
Ferdinand
and
by
0
October
0000
the
party
was
approaching
longitude
000
East
.

The
country
was
extremely
dry
and
though
tested
in
various
directions
it
was
a
constant
struggle
to
get
enough
water
to
keep
the
horses
going
.

Early
in
November
,
having
passed
longitude
000
,
a
partial
return
was
made
and
on
00
December
0000
the
neighbourhood
of
Mount
Scott
was
reached
.

A
turn
to
the
north
and
then
west
was
made
and
the
farthest
westerly
point
was
reached
on
00
April
0000
.

Giles
and
one
of
the
men
,
Alfred
Gibson
,
had
been
scouting
ahead
when
the
latter
's
horse
died
.

Giles
gave
him
his
own
horse
with
instructions
to
follow
their
tracks
back
and
obtain
assistance
.

Giles
made
his
way
back
to
their
depot
on
foot
in
eight
days
,
almost
completely
exhausted
,
to
find
that
Gibson
had
not
reached
the
camp
.

A
search
was
made
for
him
for
several
days
without
success
.

The
stores
were
almost
finished
,
nothing
further
could
be
done
,
and
on
00
May
0000
the
return
journey
began
.

Giles
named
the
desert
Gibson
Desert
after
his
companion
.

On
00
June
0000
they
were
on
a
good
track
to
the
Finke
River
and
on
00
July
0000
Charlotte
Waters
was
reached
.

Giles
had
again
failed
to
cross
the
continent
,
but
in
the
circumstances
all
had
been
done
that
was
possible
.

Giles
was
the
first
European
to
see
the
rock
formations
of
The
Olgas
,
now
known
by
their
Aboriginal
name
of
Kata
Tjuta
,
and
Lake
Amadeus
.

He
had
wanted
to
name
these
Mt
Mueller
and
Lake
Ferdinand
respectively
,
to
honour
his
benefactor
Baron
Ferdinand
von
Mueller
,
however
Mueller
prevailed
on
him
to
instead
honour
the
King
Amadeus
of
Spain
and
Queen
Olga
of
Württemberg
.

Giles
supposedly
discovered
Uluru
(
formerly
Ayers
Rock
)
,
but
was
beaten
to
the
claim
by
a
competing
explorer
,
William
Gosse
.

Third
and
fourth
expeditions
Early
in
0000
Giles
prepared
his
diaries
for
publication
under
the
title
Geographic
Travels
in
Central
Australia
,
and
on
00
March
0000
,
with
the
generous
help
of
Sir
Thomas
Elder
,
he
began
his
third
expedition
.

Proceeding
considerably
to
the
north
from
Fowler
's
Bay
the
country
was
found
to
be
very
dry
.

Retracing
his
steps
Giles
turned
east
,
and
eventually
going
round
the
north
side
of
Lake
Torrens
reached
Elder
's
station
at
Beltana
.

There
the
preparations
for
his
fourth
journey
were
made
,
and
with
Tietkins
again
his
lieutenant
,
and
with
what
Giles
had
always
wanted
,
a
caravan
of
camels
,
a
start
was
made
on
0
May
.

Port
Augusta
was
reached
on
00
May
and
,
after
taking
a
northerly
course
to
clear
the
lakes
,
a
generally
westerly
course
was
followed
.

Some
water
was
carried
,
and
the
party
was
saved
the
continual
excursions
in
search
of
water
for
horses
that
had
caused
so
much
difficulty
to
the
previous
expeditions
.

Towards
the
end
of
September
over
had
been
covered
without
finding
a
drop
of
water
,
when
almost
by
accident
on
00
September
a
supply
was
found
in
a
small
hollow
between
sand
dunes
at
Queen
Victoria
Spring
and
the
party
was
saved
.

After
a
rest
of
nine
days
the
journey
was
resumed
on
0
October
the
course
being
still
west
.

Ten
days
later
the
expedition
was
attacked
by
a
large
body
of
aborigines
and
Giles
was
compelled
to
fire
on
them
.

On
0
November
they
met
a
white
stockman
at
Tootra
out-camp
,
east
of
Bindi
Bindi
.

Their
course
was
west
to
Walebing
Station
,
then
south-west
and
on
00
November
they
arrived
at
New
Norcia
where
they
were
welcomed
by
Bishop
Salvado
.

On
00
November
0000
the
party
arrived
at
Guildford
and
Perth
the
next
day
,
where
they
had
an
enthusiastic
reception
.

Giles
stayed
for
two
months
at
Perth
.

Tietkins
and
Jess
Young
,
another
member
of
the
expedition
,
went
back
to
Adelaide
by
sea
,
and
on
00
January
0000
Giles
began
the
return
journey
taking
a
course
generally
about
000
miles
north
of
the
last
journey
.

He
arrived
at
Adelaide
in
September
0000
after
a
good
journey
during
which
the
camels
were
found
to
be
invaluable
.

Late
life
and
legacy
Giles
worked
as
a
land
classifier
in
the
Western
District
of
Victoria
from
0000-00
.

In
0000
he
published
The
Journal
of
a
Forgotten
Expedition
,
it
being
an
account
of
his
second
and
third
expeditions
,
then
in
0000
appeared
Australia
Twice
Traversed
:
The
Romance
of
Exploration
in
two
substantial
volumes
.

This
gives
an
account
of
his
five
expeditions
.

He
made
a
number
of
other
minor
journeys
and
his
last
years
were
spent
as
a
clerk
in
the
Inspector
of
Mines
'
office
at
Coolgardie
,
where
his
great
knowledge
of
the
interior
was
always
available
for
prospectors
.

Giles
was
made
a
fellow
and
awarded
the
Patron
's
Gold
Medal
of
the
Royal
Geographical
Society
in
0000
and
was
made
Cavaliere
dell
'
Ordine
della
Corona
d'Italia
(
Knight
of
the
Order
of
the
Crown
of
Italy
)
by
King
Vittorio
Emanuele
II
.

Despite
his
explorations
,
the
various
Australian
governments
at
the
time
turned
their
respective
backs
on
his
achievements
once
they
had
been
completed
,
and
refused
to
patronise
any
further
exploits
or
give
him
much
in
the
way
of
financial
reward
.

Governor
Sir
William
Jervois
claimed
on
00
October
0000
,
'
I
am
informed
that
he
gambles
and
that
his
habits
are
not
always
strictly
sober
'
.

After
a
short
illness
Giles
died
of
pneumonia
at
his
nephew
's
house
in
Coolgardie
on
00
November
0000
and
was
buried
at
the
Coolgardie
Cemetery
.

It
was
reported
at
the
time
:
H.
H.

Northwood
is
a
city
in
Wood
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Northwood
was
originally
Ross
Township
.

It
was
the
northernmost
township
in
Wood
County
from
its
establishment
on
April
00
,
0000
until
December
0
,
0000
.

Farms
,
gardens
,
orchards
,
and
railroads
covered
the
area
located
just
south
of
east
Toledo
.

In
0000
Edward
Ford
's
glass
factory
was
built
along
the
Maumee
River
,
which
ultimately
led
to
the
incorporation
of
the
village
of
Rossford
in
0000
within
the
western
portion
of
the
township
.

Ross
Township
was
then
divided
so
that
Rossford
Township
would
serve
as
a
barrier
between
Rossford
and
the
remaining
Ross
Township
.

On
December
0
,
0000
,
Ross
Township
ceased
to
exist
when
it
became
incorporated
as
the
city
of
Northwood
,
so
aptly
named
because
of
its
location
at
the
top
of
Wood
County
.

With
its
departure
,
Wood
County
dropped
its
number
of
townships
from
00
to
00
.

The
original
boundary
of
Ross
Township
can
be
observed
by
following
the
predominantly
straight
southern
border
of
Northwood
directly
west
into
Rossford
,
tracing
Elm
Tree
St.
in
a
line
directly
to
the
Maumee
River
,
and
then
along
the
Lucas
County-Wood
County
border
until
it
hits
Ottawa
County
,
and
then
runs
south
back
to
the
starting
point
.

Perrysburg
is
a
city
in
Wood
County
,
Ohio
,
United
States
,
along
the
Maumee
River
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
a
suburb
of
Toledo
,
although
it
was
founded
before
the
now
larger
city
.

History
The
European-American
history
of
Perrysburg
begins
with
the
construction
of
Fort
Meigs
.

When
the
war
clouds
of
0000
began
to
creep
upon
Northwest
Ohio
,
General
William
Henry
Harrison
ordered
the
construction
of
the
fort
,
beginning
in
February
0000
.

Harrison
was
General
Anthony
Wayne
's
former
aide-de-camp
.

Later
he
was
elected
as
the
country
's
ninth
president
.

The
installation
was
named
Fort
Meigs
in
honor
of
Ohio
's
fourth
governor
,
Return
Jonathan
Meigs
.

Fort
Meigs
was
constructed
on
a
bluff
above
the
Maumee
River
,
and
created
from
a
design
by
the
army
engineer
Captain
Eleazer
D.
Wood
,
for
whom
the
county
would
be
named
.

Two
critical
battles
with
the
British
were
fought
at
the
fort
during
the
War
of
0000
.

Early
settlers
in
the
area
fled
to
Huron
during
the
War
of
0000
.

They
returned
to
settle
in
the
floodplain
below
Fort
Meigs
,
calling
the
settlement
Orleans
.

They
moved
to
higher
ground
after
being
flooded
out
.

Perrysburg
was
surveyed
and
platted
on
April
00
,
0000
by
Maj.
Pierre
Charles
L'Enfant
(
the
only
other
city
he
platted
was
Washington
,
D.C.
)
.

It
soon
became
a
center
for
shipbuilding
and
commerce
on
Lake
Erie
.

It
was
named
after
Commodore
Oliver
Hazard
Perry
,
naval
commander
during
the
War
of
0000
.

In
0000
,
an
epidemic
of
cholera
decimated
the
population
.

The
town
closed
down
for
two
months
in
that
summer
,
trying
to
contain
the
epidemic
,
but
more
than
one
hundred
people
perished
.

Nation
,
under
the
direction
of
Wilma
Mankiller
(
then
the
director
of

Community
Development
Department
,
later
principal
chief
)
and
her
colleague
(
and

husband
)
Charlie
Soap
,
put
together
a
project
to
build
a
00-mile
waterline
to
Bell
,
where
many
of
the
residents
still
had
no
indoor
plumbing
.

The
tribe
provided
equipment
and
technological
assistance
,
while
Bell
residents
contributed
most
of
the
labor
on
a
volunteer
basis
.

The
project
drew
