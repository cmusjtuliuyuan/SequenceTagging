The
city
of
Lock
Haven
is
the
county
seat
of
Clinton
County
,
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Pennsylvania
.

Located
near
the
confluence
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
and
Bald
Eagle
Creek
,
it
is
the
principal
city
of
the
Lock
Haven
,
Pennsylvania
,
micropolitan
statistical
area
,
itself
part
of
the
Williamsport
–
Lock
Haven
combined
statistical
area
.

At
the
0000
census
,
Lock
Haven
's
population
was
0,000
.

Built
on
a
site
long
favored
by
pre-European
peoples
,
Lock
Haven
began
in
0000
as
a
timber
town
and
a
haven
for
loggers
,
boatmen
,
and
other
travelers
on
the
river
or
the
West
Branch
Canal
.

Resource
extraction
and
efficient
transportation
financed
much
of
the
city
's
growth
through
the
end
of
the
00th
century
.

In
the
00th
century
,
a
light-aircraft
factory
,
a
college
,
and
a
paper
mill
,
along
with
many
smaller
enterprises
,
drove
the
economy
.

Frequent
floods
,
especially
in
0000
,
damaged
local
industry
and
led
to
a
high
rate
of
unemployment
in
the
0000s
.

The
city
has
three
sites
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
—
Memorial
Park
Site
,
a
significant
pre-European
archaeological
find
;
Heisey
House
,
a
Victorian-era
museum
;
and
Water
Street
District
,
an
area
with
a
mix
of
00th
-
and
00th-century
architecture
.

A
levee
,
completed
in
0000
,
protects
the
city
from
further
flooding
.

While
industry
remains
important
to
the
city
,
about
a
third
of
Lock

History
Pre-European
The
earliest
settlers
in
Pennsylvania
arrived
from
Asia
between
00000
BCE
and
0000
BCE
,
when
the
glaciers
of
the
Pleistocene
Ice
Age
were
receding
.

Fluted
point
spearheads
from
this
era
,
known
as
the
Paleo-Indian
Period
,
have
been
found
in
most
parts
of
the
state
.

near
the
confluence
of
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
and
Bald
Eagle
Creek
collectively
span
about
0,000
years
and
represent
every
major
prehistoric
period
from
the
Middle
Archaic
to
the
Late
Woodland
period
.

Prehistoric
cultural
periods
over
that
span
included
the
Middle
Archaic
starting
at
0000
BCE
;
the
Late
Archaic
starting
at
0000
BCE
;
the
Early
Woodland
starting
at

BCE
;
the
Middle
Woodland
starting
at
0
CE
;
and
the
Late
Woodland
starting
at
000
CE
.

First
contact
with
Europeans
occurred
in
Pennsylvania
between
0000
and
0000
CE
.

Eighteenth
century
In
the
early
00th
century
,
a
tribal
confederacy
known
as
the
Six
Nations
of
the
Iroquois
,
headquartered
in
New
York
,
ruled
the
Indian
(
Native
American
)
tribes
of
Pennsylvania
,
including
those
who
lived
near
what
would
become
Lock
Haven
.

Indian
settlements
in
the
area
included
three
Munsee
villages
on
the
Great
Island
in
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
at
the
mouth
of
Bald
Eagle
Creek
.

Four
Indian
trails
,
the
Great
Island
Path
,
the
Great
Shamokin
Path
,
the
Bald
Eagle
Creek
Path
,
and
the
Sinnemahoning
Path
,
crossed
the
island
,
and
a
fifth
,
Logan
's
Path
,
met
Bald
Eagle
Creek
Path
a
few
miles
upstream
near
the
mouth
of
Fishing
Creek
.

During
the
French
and
Indian
War
(
0000
–
00
)
,
colonial
militiamen
on
the
Kittanning
Expedition
destroyed
Munsee
property
on
the
Great
Island
and
along
the
West
Branch
.

By
0000
,
the
Munsee
had
abandoned
their
island
villages
and
other
villages
in
the
area
.

With
the
signing
of
the
first
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
in
0000
,
the
British
gained
control
from
the
Iroquois
of
lands
south
of
the
West
Branch
.

However
,
white
settlers
continued
to
appropriate
land
,
including
tracts
in
and
near
the
future
site
of
Lock
Haven
,
not
covered
by
the
treaty
.

In
0000
,
Cleary
Campbell
,
the
first
white
settler
in
the
area
,
built
a
log
cabin
near
the
present
site
of
Lock
Haven
University
of
Pennsylvania
,
and
by
0000
William
Reed
,
another
settler
,
had
built
a
cabin
surrounded
by
a
stockade
and
called
it
Reed
's
Fort
.

It
was
the
westernmost
of
00
mostly
primitive
forts
along
the
West
Branch
;
Fort
Augusta
,
at
what
is
now
Sunbury
,
was
the
easternmost
and
most
defensible
.

In
response
to
settler
incursions
,
and
encouraged
by
the
British
during
the
American
Revolution
(
0000
–
00
)
,
Indians
attacked
colonists
and
their
settlements
along
the
West
Branch
.

Fort
Reed
and
the
other
white
settlements
in
the
area
were
temporarily
abandoned
in
0000
during
a
general
evacuation
known
as
the
Big
Runaway
.

Hundreds
of
people
fled
along
the
river
to
Fort
Augusta
,
about
from
Fort
Reed
;
some
did
not
return
for
five
years
.

In
0000
,
the
second
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
,
between
the
Iroquois
and
the
United
States
,
transferred
most
of
the
remaining
Indian
territory
in
Pennsylvania
,
including
what
would
become
Lock
Haven
,
to
the
state
.

The
U.S.
acquired
the
last
remaining
tract
,
the
Erie
Triangle
,
through
a
separate
treaty
and
sold
it
to
Pennsylvania
in
0000
.

Nineteenth
century
Lock
Haven
was
laid
out
as
a
town
in
0000
,
and
it
became
the
county
seat
in
0000
,
when
the
county
was
created
out
of
parts
of
Lycoming
and
Centre
counties
.

Incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
and
as
a
city
in
0000
,
Lock
Haven
prospered
in
the
00th
century
largely
because
of
timber
and
transportation
.

The
forests
of
Clinton
County
and
counties
upriver
held
a
huge
supply
of
white
pine
and
hemlock
as
well
as
oak
,
ash
,
maple
,
poplar
,
cherry
,
beech
,
and
magnolia
.

The
wood
was
used
locally
for
such
things
as
frame
houses
,
shingles
,
canal
boats
,
and
wooden
bridges
,
and
whole
logs
were
floated
to
Chesapeake
Bay
and
on
to
Baltimore
,
to
make
spar
s
for
ships
.

Log
driving
and
log
rafting
,
competing
forms
of
transporting
logs
to
sawmill
s
,
began
along
the
West
Branch
around
0000
.

By
0000
,
slightly
before
the
founding
of
the
town
,
the
lumber
industry
was
well
established
.

The
West
Branch
Canal
,
which
opened
in
0000
,
ran
from
Northumberland
to
Farrandsville
,
about
upstream
from
Lock
Haven
.

A
state-funded
extension
called
the
Bald
Eagle
Cut
ran
from
the
West
Branch
through
Lock
Haven
and
Flemington
to
Bald
Eagle
Creek
.

A
privately
funded
extension
,
the
Bald
Eagle
and
Spring
Creek
Navigation
,
eventually
reached
Bellefonte
,
upstream
.

Lock
Haven
's
founder
,
Jeremiah
Church
,
and
his
brother
,
Willard
,
chose
the
town
site
in
0000
partly
because
of
the
river
,
the
creek
,
and
the
canal
.

Church
named
the
town
Lock
Haven
because
it
had
a
canal
lock
and
because
it
was
a
haven
for
loggers
,
boatmen
,
and
other
travelers
.

Over
the
next
quarter
century
,
canal
boats
wide
and
long
carried
passengers
and
mail
as
well
as
cargo
such
as
coal
,
ashes
for
lye
and
soap
,
firewood
,
food
,
furniture
,
dry
goods
,
and
clothing
.

A
rapid
increase
in
Lock
Haven
's
population
(
to
000
by
0000
)
followed
the
opening
of
the
canal
.

A
Lock
Haven
log
boom
,
smaller
than
but
otherwise
similar
to
the
Susquehanna
Boom
at
Williamsport
,
was
constructed
in
0000
.

Large
cribs
of
timbers
weighted
with
tons
of
stone
were
arranged
in
the
pool
behind
the
Dunnstown
Dam
,
named
for
a
settlement
on
the
shore
opposite
Lock
Haven
.

The
piers
,
about
from
one
another
,
stretched
in
a
line
from
the
dam
to
a
point
upriver
.

Connected
by
timbers
shackled
together
with
iron
yokes
and
rings
,
the
piers
anchored
an
enclosure
into
which
the
river
current
forced
floating
logs
.

Workers
called
boom
rats
sorted
the
captured
logs
,
branded
like
cattle
,
for
delivery
to
sawmills
and
other
owners
.

Lock
Haven
became
the
lumber
center
of
Clinton
County
and
the
site
of
many
businesses
related
to
forest
products
.

The
Sunbury
and
Erie
Railroad
,
renamed
the
Philadelphia
and
Erie
Railroad
in
0000
,
reached
Lock
Haven
in
0000
,
and
with
it
came
a
building
boom
.

Hoping
that
the
area
's
coal
,
iron
ore
,
white
pine
,
and
high-quality
clay
would
produce
significant
future
wealth
,
railroad
investors
led
by
Christopher
and
John
Fallon
financed
a
line
to
Lock
Haven
.

On
the
strength
of
the
railroad
's
potential
value
to
the
city
,
local
residents
had
invested
heavily
in
housing
,
building
large
homes
between
0000
and
0000
.

Although
the
Fallons
'
coal
and
iron
ventures
failed
,
Gothic
Revival
,
Greek
Revival
,
and
Italianate
mansions
and
commercial
buildings
such
as
the
Fallon
House
,
a
large
hotel
,
remained
,
and
the
railroad
provided
a
new
mode
of
transport
for
the
ongoing
timber
era
.

A
second
rail
line
,
the
Bald
Eagle
Valley
Railroad
,
originally
organized
as
the
Tyrone
and
Lock
Haven
Railroad
and
completed
in
the
0000s
,
linked
Lock
Haven
to
Tyrone
,
to
the
southwest
.

The
two
rail
lines
soon
became
part
of
the
network
controlled
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

During
the
era
of
log
floating
,
logjams
sometimes
occurred
when
logs
struck
an
obstacle
.

Log
rafts
floating
down
the
West
Branch
had
to
pass
through
chutes
in
canal
dams
.

The
rafts
were
commonly
wide
—
narrow
enough
to
pass
through
the
chutes
—
and
to
long
.

In
0000
,
a
large
raft
got
wedged
in
the
chute
of
the
Dunnstown
Dam
and
caused
a
jam
that
blocked
the
channel
from
bank
to
bank
with
a
pile
of
logs
high
.

The
jam
eventually
trapped
another
000
log
rafts
,
and
0
canal
boats
,
The
Mammoth
of
Newport
and
The
Sarah
Dunbar
.

In
terms
of
board
feet
,
the
peak
of
the
lumber
era
in
Pennsylvania
arrived
in
about
0000
,
when
went
through
the
boom
at
Williamsport
.

These
logs
produced
a
total
of
about
(
000,000
m0
)
of
sawed
lumber
.

After
that
,
production
steadily
declined
throughout
the
state
.

Lock
Haven
's
timber
business
was
also
affected
by
flooding
,
which
badly
damaged
the
canals
and
destroyed
the
log
boom
in
0000
.

The
Central
State
Normal
School
,
established
to
train
teachers
for
central
Pennsylvania
,
held
its
first
classes
in
0000
at
a
site
overlooking
the
West
Branch
Susquehanna
River
.

The
small
school
,
with
enrollments
below
000
until
the
0000s
,
eventually
became
Lock
Haven
University
of
Pennsylvania
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
New
York
and
Pennsylvania
Paper
Mill
in
Castanea
Township
near
Flemington
began
paper
production
on
the
site
of
a
former
sawmill
;
the
paper
mill
remained
a
large
employer
until
the
end
of
the
00th
century
.

Twentieth
century
As
older
forms
of
transportation
such
as
the
canal
boat
disappeared
,
new
forms
arose
.

One
of
these
,
the
electric
trolley
,
began
operation
in
Lock
Haven
in
0000
.

The
Lock
Haven
Electric
Railway
,
managed
by
the
Lock
Haven
Traction
Company
and
after
0000
by
the
Susquehanna
Traction
Company
,
ran
passenger
trolleys
between
Lock
Haven
and
Mill
Hall
,
about
to
the
west
.

The
trolley
line
extended
from
the
Philadelphia
and
Erie
Railroad
station
in
Lock
Haven
to
a
station
of
the
Central
Railroad
of
Pennsylvania
,
which
served
Mill
Hall
.

The
route
went
through
Lock
Haven
's
downtown
,
close
to
the
Normal
School
,
across
town
to
the
trolley
car
barn
on
the
southwest
edge
of
the
city
,
through
Flemington
,
over
the
Bald
Eagle
Canal
and
Bald
Eagle
Creek
,
and
on
to
Mill
Hall
via
what
was
then
known
as
the
Lock
Haven
,
Bellefonte
,
and
Nittany
Valley
Turnpike
.

Plans
to
extend
the
line
from
Mill
Hall
to
Salona
,
miles
south
of
Mill
Hall
,
and
to
Avis
northeast
of
Lock
Haven
,
were
never
carried
out
,
and
the
line
remained
unconnected
to
other
trolley
lines
.

The
system
,
always
financially
marginal
,
declined
after
World
War
I.
Losing
business
to
automobiles
and
buses
,
it
ceased
operations
around
0000
.

William
T.
Piper
,
Sr.
,
built
the
Piper
Aircraft
Corporation
factory
in
Lock
Haven
in
0000
after
the
company
's
Taylor
Aircraft
manufacturing
plant
in
Bradford
,
Pennsylvania
,
was
destroyed
by
fire
.

The
factory
began
operations
in
a
building
that
once
housed
a
silk
mill
.

As
the
company
grew
,
the
original
factory
expanded
to
include
engineering
and
office
buildings
.

Piper
remained
in
the
city
until
0000
,
when
its
new
owner
,
Lear-Siegler
,
moved
production
to
Vero
Beach
,
Florida
.

The
Clinton
County
Historical
Society
opened
the
Piper
Aviation
Museum
at
the
site
of
the
former
factory
in
0000
,
and
00
years
later
the
museum
became
an
independent
organization
.

The
state
of
Pennsylvania
acquired
Central
State
Normal
School
in
0000
and
renamed
it
Lock
Haven
State
Teachers
College
in
0000
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
the
student
population
grew
from
000
to
more
than
0,000
;
the
number
of
teaching
faculty
rose
from
00
to
000
,
and
the
college
carried
out
a
large
building
program
.

The
school
's
name
was
changed
to
Lock
Haven
State
College
in
0000
,
and
its
emphasis
shifted
to
include
the
humanities
,
fine
arts
,
mathematics
,
and
social
sciences
,
as
well
as
teacher
education
.

Becoming
Lock
Haven
University
of
Pennsylvania
in
0000
,
it
opened
a
branch
campus
in
Clearfield
,
west
of
Lock
Haven
,
in
0000
.

An
industrial
area
in
Castanea
Township
adjacent
to
Lock
Haven
was
placed
on
the
National
Priorities
List
of
uncontrolled
hazardous
waste
sites
(
commonly
referred
to
as
Superfund
sites
)
in
0000
.

Drake
Chemical
,
which
went
bankrupt
in
0000
,
made
ingredients
for
pesticides
and
other
compounds
at
the
site
from
the
0000s

Environmental
Protection
Agency
began
a
clean-up
of
contaminated
containers
,
buildings
,
and
soils
at

Floods
Pennsylvania
's
streams
have
frequently
flooded
.

According
to
William
H.
Shank
,
the
Indians
of
Pennsylvania
warned
white
settlers
that
great
floods
occurred
on
the
Delaware
and
Susquehanna
rivers
every
00
years
.

Shank
tested
this
idea
by
tabulating
the
highest
floods
on
record
at
key
points
throughout
the
state
over
a
000-year
period
and
found
that
a
major
flood
had
occurred
,
on
average
,
once
every
00
years
between
0000
and
0000
.

Big
floods
recorded
at
Harrisburg
,
on
the
main
stem
of
the
Susquehanna
about
miles
downstream
from
Lock
Haven
,
occurred
in
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
and
0000
.

Readings
from
the
Williamsport
stream
gauge
,
miles
below
Lock
Haven
on
the
West
Branch
of
the
Susquehanna
,
showed
major
flooding
between
0000
and
0000
in
the
same
years
as
the
Harrisburg
station
;
in
addition
,
a
large
flood
occurred
on
the
West
Branch
at
Williamsport
in
0000
.

Estimated
flood-crest
readings
between
0000
and
0000
—
based
on
data
from
the
National
Weather
Service
flood
gauge
at
Lock
Haven
—
show
that
flooding
likely
occurred
in
the
city
00
times
in
000
years
.

The
biggest
flood
occurred
on
March
00
,
0000
,
when
the
river
crested
at
,
which
was
about
above
the
flood
stage
of
.

The
third
biggest
flood
,
cresting
at
in
Lock
Haven
,
occurred
on
June
0
,
0000
,
and
coincided
with
the
Johnstown
Flood
.

The
flood
demolished
Lock
Haven
's
log
boom
,
and
millions
of
feet
of
stored
timber
were
swept
away
.

The
flood
damaged
the
canals
,
which
were
subsequently
abandoned
,
and
destroyed
the
last
of
the
canal
boats
based
in
the
city
.

The
most
damaging
Lock
Haven
flood
was
caused
by
the
remnants
of
Hurricane
Agnes
in
0000
.

The
storm
,
just
below
hurricane
strength
when
it
reached
the
region
,
made
landfall
on
June
00
near
New
York
City
.

Agnes
merged
with
a
non-tropical
low
on
June
00
,
and
the
combined
system
affected
the
northeastern
United
States
until
June
00
.

The
combination
produced
widespread
rains
of
with
local
amounts
up
to
in
western
Schuylkill
County
,
about
southeast
of
Lock
Haven
.

At
Lock
Haven
,
the
river
crested
on
June
00
at
,
second
only
to
the
0000
crest
.

The
flood
greatly
damaged
the
paper
mill
and
Piper
Aircraft
.

Federal
,
state
,
and
local
governments
began
construction
in
0000
of
barriers
to
protect
the
city
.

The
project
included
a
levee
of
and
a
flood
wall
of
along
the
Susquehanna
River
and
Bald
Eagle
Creek
,
closure
structures
,
retention
basin
s
,
a
pumping
station
,
and
some
relocation
of
roads
and
buildings
.

Completed
in
0000
,
the
levee
protected
the
city
from
high
water
in
the
year
of
the
Blizzard
of
0000
,
and
again
0000
,
when
rainfall
from
the
remnants
of
Hurricane
Ivan
threatened
the
city

History
The

of
European
settlement
date
to
the
year
0000
,
when
James
McClure
established
a
log
cabin
in
the
area
.

Until
the
mid-nineteenth

it
was
just
a
small
village
,
known
as
the
Bloom
Township
.

Traditionally
,
Bloomsburg
's
founding
in
0000
has
been
ascribed
to
settler
Ludwig
Eyer
,
son
of
Johann
Martin
Eyer
.

For
a
00
years
after
the
discovery
of
ore
in
the
area
,
Bloomsburg
developed
a

iron
industry
.

For

,

on

0
,

still
uses
the
slogan
of
"
The

,
"
and
state

publications
continue

Centralia
is
a
borough
and
a
near
ghost
town
in
Columbia
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United

.

Its
population
has
dwindled
from
over
0,000
residents
in
0000
to
00
in
0000
,
as
a
result
of
a
mine
fire
burning
beneath
the

since
0000
.

Centralia
is
one
of
the
least-populated

the
eminent
domain
claim
.

History
Early
history
In
0000
,
Johnathan
Faust
opened
the
Bull
's
Head
Tavern
in
what
was
then
Roaring
Creek
Township
.

Thirteen
years
later
,
Alexander
W.
Rea
,
a
civil
and
mining
engineer
for
the
Locust
Mountain
Coal
and
Iron
Company
,
moved
to
the
site
and
laid
out
streets
and
lots
for
development
.

The
town
was
known
as
Centreville
until
0000
.

Since
there
was
already
a
Centreville
in
Schuylkill
County
,
the
Post
Office
refused
to
allow
it
to
use
the
same
name
.

Rea
then
changed
his
village
to
Centralia
.

Centralia
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

Its
principal
employer
was
the
anthracite
coal
industry
.

Coal
mining
continued
in
Centralia
until
the
0000s
,
when
most
of
the
companies
shut
down
.

Bootleg
mining
continued
until
0000
and
strip
and
open-pit
mining
are
still
active
in
the
area
.

There
is
an
underground
mine
employing
about
00
people
three
miles
to
the
west
.

Centralia
was
a
hotbed
of
Molly
Maguires
activity
during
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Alexander
Rea
,
The
town
's
founder
,
was
murdered
by
members
of
the
Molly
Maguires
on
October
00
,
0000
.

Three
men
were
eventually
convicted
of
his
death
and
were
hanged
in
the
county
seat
of
Bloomsburg
,
on
March
00
,
0000
.

Several
other
murders
and
incidents
of
arson
also
took
place
during
the
violence
.

Centralia
was
served
by
two
railroads
,
the
Philadelphia
and
Reading
and
the
Lehigh
Valley
,
the
Lehigh
Valley
having
been
the
principal
carrier
.

Rail
service
ended
in
0000
.

Centralia
operated
its
own
school
district
,
including
elementary
schools
and
a
high
school
.

There
were
also
two
Catholic
parochial
schools
.

Centralia
at
its
peak
had
seven
churches
,
five
hotels
,
twenty-seven
saloons
,
two
theaters
,
a
bank
,
a
post
office
,
and
00
general
and
grocery
stores
.

The
population
reached
0,000
in
the
0000
federal
census
,
then
went
into
decline
.

By
0000
,
it
had
just
0,000
residents
.

Another
000
or
000
lived
nearby
.

Mine
fire
In
0000
,
a
fire
started
in
a
mine
beneath
the
town
and
ultimately
led
to
the
town
being
abandoned
.

There
is
some
disagreement
over
the
specific
event
which
triggered
the
fire
.

David
DeKok
,
after
studying
available
local
and
state
government
documents
and
interviewing

Mine
Fire
,
that
in

,
the
Centralia
Borough
Council
hired
five
members
of

company
to
clean
up
the
town
landfill
,
located
in
an
abandoned

pit
next

This

0000
,
the
firefighters
,
as
they
had
in
the
past
,
set
the
dump
on
fire
and
let
it
burn
for
some
time
.

Unlike
in
previous
years
,
however
,
the
fire
was
not
fully
extinguished
.

An
unsealed
opening
in
the
pit
allowed
the
fire
to
enter
the
labyrinth
of
abandoned
coal
mines
beneath
Centralia
.

Joan
Quigley
argues
in
her
0000
book
,
The
Day
the
Earth
Caved
In
,
that
the
fire
had
in
fact
started
the
previous
day
,
when
a
trash
hauler
dumped
hot
ash
or
coal
discarded
from
coal
burners
into
the
open
trash
pit
.

She
noted
that
borough
council
minutes
from
June
0
,
0000
referred
to
two
fires
at
the
dump
,
and
that
five
firefighters
had
submitted
bills
for
"
fighting
the
fire
at
the
landfill
area
"
.

The
borough
,
by
law
,
was
responsible
for
installing
a
fire-resistant
clay
barrier
between
each
layer
,
but
fell
behind
schedule
,
leaving
the
barrier
incomplete
.

This
allowed
the
hot
coals
to
penetrate
the
vein
of
coal
underneath
the
pit
and
light
the
subsequent
subterranean
fire
.

Another
theory
of
note
is
the
Bast
Theory
.

According
to
legend
,
the
Bast
Colliery
coal
fire
of
0000
was
never
fully
extinguished
.

In
0000
,
it
reached
the
landfill
area
.

In
0000
,
locals
became
aware
of
the
scale
of
the
problem
when
a
gas-station
owner
and
then
mayor
,
John
Coddington
,
inserted
a
stick
into
one
of
his
underground
tanks
to
check
the
fuel
level
.

When
he
withdrew
it
,
it
seemed
hot
,
so
he
lowered
a
thermometer
down
on
a
string
and
was
shocked
to
discover
that
the
temperature
of
the
gasoline
in
the
tank
was
.

Statewide
attention
to
the
fire
began
to
increase
,
culminating
in
0000
when
a
00-year-old
resident
named
Todd
Domboski
fell
into
a
sinkhole
wide
by
deep
that
suddenly
opened
beneath
his
feet
in
a
backyard
.

His
cousin
,
00-year-old
Eric
Wolfgang
,
in
pulling
Todd
out
of
the
hole
,
saved
Todd
's
life
,
as
the
plume
of
hot
steam
billowing
from
the
hole
was
measured
as
containing
a
lethal
level
of
carbon
monoxide
.

In
0000
,
the
U.S.
Congress
allocated
more
than
US$
00
million
for
relocation
efforts
.

Most
of
the
residents
accepted
buyout
offers
and
moved
to
the
nearby
communities
of
Mount
Carmel
and
Ashland
.

A
few
families
opted
to
stay
despite
warnings
from
Pennsylvania
officials
.

In
0000
,
Pennsylvania
governor
Bob
Casey
invoked
eminent
domain
on
all
properties
in
the
borough
,
condemning
all
the
buildings
within
.

A
subsequent
legal
effort
by
residents
to
have
the
decision
reversed
failed
.

In
0000
,
Governor
Ed
Rendell
began
the
formal
eviction
of
Centralia
residents
.

The
Centralia
mine
fire
extended
into
the
town
of
Byrnesville
,
Pennsylvania
and
caused
this
town
to
also
be
abandoned
.

Today
Very
few
homes
remain
standing
in
Centralia
;
most
of
the
abandoned
buildings
have
been
demolished
by
the
Columbia
County
Redevelopment
Authority
or
nature
.

At
a
casual
glance
,
the
area
now
appears
to
be
a
field
with
many
paved
streets
running
through
it
.

Some
areas
are
being
filled
with
new-growth
forest
.

The
remaining
church
in
the
borough
,
St.
Mary
's
,
holds
weekly
services
on
Sunday
and
has
not
yet
been
directly
affected
by
the
fire
.

The
town
's
four
cemeteries
—
including
one
on
the
hilltop
that
has
smoke
rising
around
and
out
of
it
—
are
maintained
in
good
condition
.

There
is
also
a
notice
board
posted
near
Hammie
Hill
,
about
000
yards
from
the
cemetery
,
protesting
the
evictions
and
demanding
former
Governor
Rendell
intervene
.

The
only
indications
of
the
fire
,
which
underlies
some
spreading
along
four
fronts
,
are
low
round
metal
steam
vents
in
the
south
of
the
borough
and
several
signs
warning
of
underground
fire
,
unstable
ground
,
and
carbon
monoxide
.

Additional
smoke
and
steam
can
be
seen
coming
from
an
abandoned
portion
of
Pennsylvania
Route
00
,
the
area
just
behind
the
hilltop
cemetery
,
and
other
cracks
in
the
ground
scattered
about
the
area
.

Route
00
was
repaired
several
times
until
its
final
closing
.

The
current
route
was
a
detour
around
the
damaged
portion
during
the
repairs
and
became
a
permanent
route
in
0000
;
mounds
of
dirt
were
placed
at
both
ends
of
the
former
route
,
effectively
blocking
the
road
.

Pedestrian
traffic
is
still
possible
due
to
a
small
opening
about
two
feet
wide
at
the
north
side
of
the
road
,
but
this
is
muddy
and
not
accessible
to
the
disabled
.

The
underground
fire
is
still
burning
and
may
continue
to
do
so
for
000
years
.

Prior
to
its
demolition
in
September
0000
,
the
last
remaining
house
on
Locust
Avenue
was
notable
for
the
five
chimney-like
support
buttresses
along
each
of
two
opposite
sides
of
the
house
,
where
the
house
was
supported
by
a
row
of
adjacent
buildings
before
it
was
demolished
.

Another
house
with
similar
buttresses
was
visible
from
the
northern
side
of
the
cemetery
,
just
north
of
the
burning
,
partially
subsumed
hillside
.

The
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
did
not
renew
the
relocation
contract
at
the
end
of
0000
,
and
the
fate
of
the
remaining
residents
is
uncertain
.

In
0000
,
John
Comarnisky
and
John
Lokitis
,
Jr.
were
both
evicted
,
in
May
and
July
respectively
.

In
0000
,
only
five
homes
remain
as
state
officials
try
to
vacate
the
remaining
residents
and
demolish
what
is
left
of
the
town
.

In
May
0000
,
the
remaining
residents
mounted
another
legal
effort
to
reverse
the
0000
eminent
domain
claim
.

In
March
0000
,
a
federal
judge
refused
to
issue
an
injunction
that
would
have
stopped
the
condemnation
.

In
February
0000
,
the
Commonwealth
Court
ruled
that
a
declaration
of
taking
could
not
be
re-opened
or
set
aside
on
the
basis
that
the
purpose
for
the
condemnation
no
longer
exists
;
seven
people
,
including
the
Borough
Council
president
,
had
filed
suit
claiming
the
condemnation
was
no
longer
needed
because
the
underground
fire
had
moved
and
the
air
quality
in
the
borough
was
the
same
as
that
in
Lancaster
.

The
Pottsville
Republican
&
Herald
reported
in
February
0000
that
the
Borough
Council
still
has
regular
meetings
.

The
news
story
reported
that
the
town
's
highest
bill
at
the
meeting
reported
on
came
from
PPL
at
$
00
and
the
town
's
budget
was
"
in
the
black
"
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
The
Assumption
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
Mary
Church
celebrated
000
years
of
worship
.

This
church
is
located
on
the
north
hill
overlooking
the
town
.

It
was
allowed
to
stay
because
of
its
distance
from
the
mine
fire
.

It
is
expected
that
many
former
residents
will
return
in
0000
to
open
a
time
capsule
buried
in
0000
next
to
the
veterans
'
memorial
.

Mineral
rights
Several
current
and
former
Centralia
residents
believe
the
state
's
eminent
domain
claim
was
a
plot
to
gain
the
mineral
rights
to
the
anthracite
coal
beneath
the
borough
.

Residents
have
asserted
its
value
to
be
in
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
,
although
the
exact
amount
of
coal
is
not
known
.

This
theory
stems
from
the
municipality
laws
of
the
state
.

According
to
state
law
,
when
the
municipality
can
no
longer
form
a
functioning
municipal
government
,
i.e.
when
there
are
no
longer
any
residents
,
the
borough
legally
ceases
to
exist
.

At
that
point
,
the
mineral
rights
,
which
are
owned
by
the
Borough
of
Centralia
(
they
are
not
privately
held
)
would
revert
to
the
ownership
of
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
.

Norrbotten
County
(
Norrbottens
län
)
is
the
northernmost
county
or
län
of
Sweden
.

It
borders
Västerbotten
County
to
the
southwest
,
the
Gulf
of
Bothnia
to
the
southeast
.

It
also
borders
the
counties
of
Nordland
and
Troms
in
Norway
to
the
northwest
,
and
Lapland
Province
in
Finland
to
the
northeast
.

The
name
"
Norrbotten
"
is
also
used
for
a
province
of
the
same
name
.

Norrbotten
province
covers
only
the
eastern
part
of
Norrbotten
County
–
the
inland
mostly
belongs
to
the
Swedish
Lapland
province
(
Lappland
)
.

Provinces
Norrbotten
County
exists
on
provinces
of
Norrbotten
and
about
two
thirds
of
Swedish
Lapland
.

Geography
Norrbotten
County
covers
almost
one
quarter
of
Sweden
's
surface
,
but
is
sparsely
inhabited
.

This
is
especially
true
for
inland
part
of
Lapland
.

The
climate
is
generally
harsh
,
which
is
not
surprising
considering
its
northern
location
.

However
,
the
long
summer
days
allow
crops
to
ripen
within
two
to
three
months
,
and
various
grain
s
are
commonly
grown
and
make
up
an
important
part
of
the
industry
.

Besides
grains
,
potato
es
and
turnip
s
are
also
grown
.

The
most
important
plant
is
however
grass
,
used
as
hay
for
the
livestock
.

Major
river
s
in
Norrbotten
County
(
north
–
south
)
include
the
Torne
River
,
Lule
River
,
Kalix
River
,
and
Pite
River
.

Rivers
shared
with
Västerbotten
County
include
Skellefte
River
and
Ume
River
.

Other
rivers
that
flow
directly
to
the
sea
and
that
are
at
least
000
km
long
are
the
Sangis
River
,
Råne
River
,
Åby
River
,
and
Byske
River
.

Population
The
population
has
increased
during
the
last
hundred
years
.

The
estimated
0000
population
was
000,000
.

In
the
0000
census
,
the
population
was
000,000
,
(
0,000
more
males
than
females
)
,
and
of
this
,
around
000,000
belonged
to
the
Norrbotten
province
part
.

Twenty
years
earlier
,
in
0000
,
the
population
was
only
000,000
.

Since
the
0000s
,
however
,
most
municipalities
of
the
county
have
experienced
a
decrease
in
population
figures
,
particularly
in
the
inland
.

History
During
the
Middle
Ages
,
Norrbotten
was
considered
to
be
terra
nullius
(
"
no
man
's
land
"
)
.

The
area
was
sparsely
populated
by
Sami
,
Kvens
and
different
tribes
/
people
related
to
the
Finns
.

From
the
Middle
Ages
on
,
the
Swedish
kings
tried
hard
to
colonise
and
Christianise
the
area
.

This
took
time
,
however
;
even
today
,
there
are
Finnish
and
Sami
minorities
living
in
the
area
,
who
have
maintained
their
own
culture
and
customs
.

Following
the
Finnish
War
in
0000
,
Västerbotten
County
was
split
between
Sweden
and
Finland
,
with
the
larger
part
remaining
within
the
Swedish
borders
.

In
0000
,
the
county
was
divided
again
when
Norrbotten
County
was
created
out
of
the
northern
part
,
on
the
Swedish
side
.

Most
people
in
Norrbotten
County
still
refer
to
the
entire
county
,
including
the
areas
in
Finnish
Lapland
,
when
they
say
'
Norrbotten
'
,
which
is
also
the
name
of
a
smaller
province
for
practical
and
historical
reasons
,
which
do
not
imply
that
they
would
not
prefer
to
use
the
name
Lapland
.

The
natural
resource
s
(
hydroelectricity
,
timber
,
and
minerals
,
especially
iron
)
of
Norrbotten
have
played
a
key
role
in
the
industrialization
of
Sweden
,
all
through
the
00th
century
the
region
saw
strong
mobility
in
and
out
of
the
county
,
many
young
people
moving
south
and
people
from
other
parts
of
the
country
moving
in
.

In
the
0000s
and
0000s
the
drainage
of
(
mostly
young
)
workers
was
very
powerful
,
due
to
high
unemployment
,
and
people
in
the
area

Culture
The
culture
of
Norrbotten
County
is
in
many
ways
different
from
the
rest
of
Sweden
,
since
so
many
different
cultures
can
be
found
there
;
the
Sami
culture
,
the
Finnish
culture
(
Tornedalians
)
and
the
Swedish
settler-culture
(
combined
with
the
climate
,
midnight
sun
,
and
mid
winter
darkness
)
.

Many
of
the
old
local
Swedish
and
Finnish
dialects
have
survived
in
the
area
,
and
are
spoken
by
a
great
number
of
people
.

The
people
of
Norrbotten
County
have
a
saying
:
"
I
am
not
a
Swede
;
I
am
a
Norrbothnian
"
.

A
laconic
and
,
at
first
glance
,
uncommunicative
way
of
speaking
,
coupled
with
understated
irony
,
is
also
sometimes
used
as
a
means
to
hold
off
the
southerners
,
who
are
seen
as
more
slick
and
deceptive
in
their
ways
with
words
and
eager
to
twist
things
their
way
.

These
contrasts
are
well
known
throughout
Sweden
and
often
appear
in
TV
,
films
,
literature
and
folklore
connected
to
Norrbotten
,
for
characterizing
,
satiric
or
dramatic
purposes
(
e.g.
some
characters
in
the
books
of
Eyvind
Johnson
or
the
police
detective
Einar
Rönn
in
the
crime
novels
of
Maj
Sjöwall
and
Per
Wahlöö
)

has
the
historical
cities
of
Luleå

Arjeplog
Municipality
(
Swedish
:
Arjeplogs
kommun
,
)
is
a
municipality
in
Norrbotten
County
in
northern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
Arjeplog
.

The
area
which
now
is
Arjeplog
Municipality
used
to
be
a
single
parish
(
Swedish
:
socken
)
,
which
was
made
into
a
municipality
when
the
first
Swedish
local
government
acts
were
implemented
in
0000
.

It
has
not
been
amalgamated
with
any
other
entity
.

History
People
lived
in
the
area
of
today
's
municipality
as
early
as
00,000
years
ago
,
following
the
end
of
the
last
ice
age
.

For
a
long
time
it
was
only
populated
by
a
fishing
and
hunting
people
,
the
Sami
people
,
who
have
their
own
language
and
breed
reindeer
in
northern
Sweden
,
and
today
have
special
rights
as
a
Swedish
minority
group
.

The
population
in
today
's
municipality
was
only
a
few
hundred
people
in
the
00th
and
00th
century
,
most
of
them
Sami
,
and
the
rest
of
Sweden
did
not
know
much
of
them
.

Not
until
0000
did
Queen
Christina
of
Sweden
order
a
church
to
be
built
in
order
to
Christianize
the
Sami
people
in
Arjeplog
.

The
church
was
inaugurated
in
0000
.

At
first
the
deceased
were
buried
under
the
earthen
floor
in
the
church
,
but
eventually
the
stench
became
unbearable
and
the
procedure
had
to
end
.

Silver
The
interest
in
Arjeplog
had
been
sparked
when
silver
was
found
in
the
area
in
the
0000s
,
and
a
mining
industry
was
established
there
0000-0000
.

It
has
been
estimated
that
the
amount
of
silver
mined
was
00
kilograms
per
year
.

In
August
0000
,
the
Danes
and
Norwegians
–
who
were
in
the
Denmark
–
Norway
union
–
attacked
and
burned
down
the
mining
village
.

The
mining
industry
was
then
stalled
for
000
years
.

It
was
once
again
taken
up
in
0000
,
probably
as
a
means
of
supporting
the
war
of
King
Charles
XII
of
Sweden
.

The
mining
was
upheld
until
0000
,
when
the
low
profits
,
harsh
climate
and
the
long
distances
led
to
its
closure
.

There
are
still
remains
from
that
time
in
the
village
Adolfström
.

There
are
also
several
names
in
the
area
such
as
Silvervägen
(
"
Silver
Road
"
)
and
Silversundet
(
"
Silver
Strait
"
)
reminding
of
its
silver
history
.

When
a
Sami
museum
was
built
in
the
town
of
Arjeplog
in
0000
,
it
was
appropriately
named
Silvermuseet
(
"
The
Silver
Museum
"
)
.

It
is
filled
with
Sami
photos
and
artifacts
.

Arvidsjaur
Municipality
(
,
)
is
a
municipality
in
Norrbotten
County
in
northern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
Arvidsjaur
.

History
Arvidsjaur
Municipality
was
for
a
long
time
only
inhabited
by
the
Sami
people
.

They
were
back
then
a
hunting
people
,
living
off
the
abundance
of
fish
and
wildlife
in
the
area
.

Archaeological
discoveries
suggest
that
people
have
been
moving
through
the
area
for
several
thousands
of
years
.

The
name
Arvidsjaur
itself
comes
from
a
Sami
word
which
means
"
generous
water
"
and
was
originally
the
name
of
the
adjacent
lake
.

In
the
00th
and
00th
century
some
farmer
s
settled
in
the
area
.

They
acquired
fur
s
and
skins
from
the
hunters
,
and
traded
them
off
to
southern
regions
,
allegedly
in
vast
numbers
.

The
Christianization
of
Arvidsjaur
Municipality
was
slow
,
as
it
was
in
Norrland
as
a
whole
,
because
of
the
low
population
,
the
harsh
climate
and
the
long
distances
.

It
was
also
commonly
believed
that
Norrland
was
inhabited
by
magicians
.

Not
until
0000
did
the
first
settler
,
Per
Käck
,
settle
in
Arvidsjaur
.

The
settlers
built
the
first
chapel
at
the
marketplace
at
the
time
,
in
0000
.

The
first
church
was
inaugurated
in
0000
.

The
Swedish
minister
and
missionary
Petrus
Læstadius
(

–
0000
;
brother
of
Lars
Levi
Læstadius
,
founder
of
the
largest
Christian
revival
movement
in
Norrland
)
collected
old
stories
and
myth
s
in
the
area
in
the
00th
century
,
which
create
the
basis
for
our
knowledge
from
that
time
.

Geography
Arvidsjaur
Municipality
is
located
about
000
kilometres
south
of

s.
Arvidsjaur

is
a
municipality
in

County
in
northern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
Boden
.

In
0000
the
evolving
garrison
town
of
Boden
was
detached
from
Överluleå
and
instituted
as
a
city
municipality
of
its
own
.

In
0000
the
rest
of
Överluleå
was
merged
into
the
city
together
with
a
part
of
Råneå
.

In
0000
Edefors
(
which
in
0000
also
had
been
detached
from
Överluleå
)
was
added
and
the
present
municipality
was
formed
.

History
According
to
recent
finds
,
the
oldest
human
settlement
s
are
believed
to
be
from
around
0,000
BC
.

From
this
early
time
nothing
is
known
(
except
some
scarce
finds
)
.

First
accounted-for
sources
are
from
the
00th
century
,
when
Boden
is
referred
to
as
Bodebyn
or
Bodarna
,
which
may
refer
to
the
shed
s
(
bod
means
"
shed
"
)
.

In
0000
there
were
seven
farmers
in
the
community
(
each
farmer
at
that
time
might
have
several
workers
and
a
family
)
.

It
was
also
mentioned
that
native
Sami
people
were
living
in
the
proximity
.

Geography
The
closest
larger

,
proficient

Jokkmokk
Municipality
(
,
,
,
)
is
a
municipality
in
Norrbotten
County
in
northern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
Jokkmokk
.

The
name
Jokkmokk
is
Sami
for
the
words
"
river
"
and
"
bend
"
,
since
the
town
is
situated
close
to
a
bend
in
the
nearby
river
.

The
municipality
is
the
second
largest
in
size
of
all
Swedish
municipalities
and
is
,
with
an
area
of
00,000
km0
(
approximately
0,000
square
miles
)
slightly
smaller
than
Slovenia
or
the
US
state
of
New
Jersey
.

It
has
never
been
amalgamated
with
another
entity
,
having
been
that
large
ever
since
municipalities
were
established
in
Sweden
in
0000
.

History
The
name
Jokkmokk
is
present
in
the
Jokkmokk
Lapland
Court
District
,
a
historical
jurisdiction
.

When
the
municipality
was
given
its
current
borders
in
0000
,
its
municipal
coat
of
arms
were
made
to
depict
the
hydro
plant
,
the
symbol
of
Luleå
(
to
which
Jokkmokk
belonged
until
0000
)
,
and
the
traditional
Sami
hammer
s.
Geography
The
municipality
is
situated
in
the
Scandinavian
Mountains
in
Swedish
Lapland
and
is
sparsely
populated
.

A
large
part
of
the
area
has
been
the
habitat
of
reindeer
herding
Sami
people
for
thousands
of
years
and
has
for
that
reason
been
protected
as
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
under
the
name
Laponian
area
.

The
Laponian
area
is
roughly
divided
into
the
eastern
flatlands
and
the
western
mountainous
region
.

There
are
several
well-structured
and
well-maintained
starting
locations
for
those
interested
in
experiencing
the
majestic
wilderness
.

For
instance
,
the
Kvikkjokk
basecamp
provides
excursions
and
has
a
high
quality
hostel
.

Due
to
the
northern
location
,
the
aurora
borealis
can
be
experienced
all
through
winter
(
November
to
March
)
,
and
the
midnight
sun
can
be
experienced
during
June
and
July
.

The
Lule
River
and
the
Lesser
Lule
River
flows
through
the
district
.

The
rivers
are
heavily
regulated
for
Hydroelectricity
,
most
of
all
in
Sweden
.

0
of
the
00
largest
hydroplants
are
located
in
the
area
.

This
includes
the
000
MW
Harsprånget
,
the
000
MW
Porjus
and
the
000
MW
Messaure
.

There
's
a
total
of
00
Hydroplants
in
the
area
,
0
over
000
MW
,
0
over
000
MW
and
0
over
000
MW
.

National
parks
The
four
national
park
s
in
Jokkmokk
Municipality
all
have
their
own
distinct
identity
.

The
national
parks
are
Sarek
,
Muddus
,
Padjelanta
and
Stora
Sjöfallet
.

These
national
parks
are
popular
with
tourists
all
year
around
but
the
darkest
and
coldest
months
(
November
to
January
)
are
not
recommended
for
beginners
.

The
best
period
for
sunshine
and
winter
activities
is
from
February
all
through
April
,
when
the
snow
lies
deep
and
the
days
are
long
.

This
time
of
year
the
national
parks
are
easily
accessible
by
snowmobile
and
ski
s.
Visitors
should
understand
and
respect
that
the
wilderness
is
just
that
,
and
snowmobiles
are
not
allowed
in
the
parks
at
any
time
.

The
summer
in
Jokkmokk
Municipality
is
short
but
intense
.

The
ground
is
free
of
snow
from
May
until
late
October
,
early
November
.

As
with
most
areas
in
the
Nordic
countries
,
the
actual
warm
period
is
quite
short
,
but
as
Jokkmokk
Municipality
has
a
continental
climate
,
the
temperature
can
top
00
degrees
Celsius
in
the
summer
and
reach
as
low
as
-00
degrees
Celsius
in
the
winter
.

During
the
summer
months
hikers
and
other
friends
of
nature
converge
in
the
national
parks
and
this
is
also
the
time
when
most
of
the
parks
are
most
easily
accessed
.

Visitors
should
be
warned
that
the
amount
of
mosquito
es
can
be
difficult
to
those
not
used
to
them
and
driving
has
an
added
danger
in
the
reindeer
that
seek
shelter
from
the
mosquitoes
.

Collisions
with
reindeer
are
frequent
in
most
of
the
northern
parts
of
the
Nordic
countries
and
drivers
should
keep
an
eye
out
.

Fall
is
also
short
and
the
shifting
colors
of
the
wide
forests
make
the
surroundings
burn
with
color
.

This
is
a
good
time
for
hiking
but
due
to
the
shifting
temperatures
the
mountainous
parts
of
the
national
parks
can
be
treacherous
for
those
unprepared
.

Other
attractions
Jokkmokk
is
known
for
its
Sami
market
held
the
first
weekend
every
February
.

This
market
has
been
held
for
more
than
000
consecutive
years
.

Initially
a
gathering
of
traders
from
the
entire
region
the
market
has
long
since
grown
to
be
more
than
a
simple
gathering
of
traders
and
is
now
a
week
long
cultural
event
with
lectures
,
art
exhibitions
,
concerts
and
much
more
.

Getting
there
There
are
several
hotels
and
hostels
in
Jokkmokk
,
Vuollerim
and
Porjus
.

Jokkmokk
is
easily
accessed
by
car
and
bus
from
Luleå
and
Gällivare
,
where
the
nearest
airport
s
are
to
be
found
.

Jokkmokk
can
also
be
reached
by
train
.

Kalix
Municipality
(
,
)
is
a
municipality
in
Norrbotten
County
in
northern
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
Kalix
.

In
0000
Töre
Municipality
was
detached
from
Nederkalix
Municipality
,
forming
a
municipality
of
its
own
.

In
0000
the
two
units
were
reunified
,
and
the
present
municipality
was
created
.

History
In
historical
times
,
Kalix
was
the
name
of
the
court
district
(
Swedish
:
domsaga
)
Kalix
Lower
Court
District
.

It
covered
two
parish
es
:
Lower
and
Upper
Kalix
(
Swedish
:
Nederkalix
and
Överkalix
,
respectively
)
.

The
chalice
on
the
coat
of
arms
was
present
in
the
Nederkalix
coat
of
arms
in
0000
,
and
was
incorporated
into
that
of
Kalix
Municipality
in
0000
.

The
choice
of
symbol
originates
from
the
similarity
between
the
Latin
root
of
chalice
,
calix
,
and
the
local
sami
pronunciation
of
Gáláseatnu
,
an
ancient
name
for
the
Kalix
river
.

Localities
There
are
twelve
localities
(
or
urban
areas
)
in
Kalix
Municipality
:

Language
The
extent
of
the

Municipality
is
based
on
the
traditional
extent
of
the
Kalix
Language
,
although
slight
dialectal
differences
can
be
found
from
Sangis
in
the
east
,
Töre
in
the
west
and
Övermorjärv
in

Today
it
is

along
with
Sami
,
Finnish
,
Meänkieli
,
Upper
Kalix
Language
,
and
the
national
standard
language
Swedish
,
which
has
replaced
the
Kalix
Language
as
common
language
in
every
day
life
.

Like
other
North
Germanic
languages
the
Kalix

origins
from

,
spoken
by
immigrating
Germanic
settlers
during

Kiruna
(
Northern
Sami
:
Giron
,
Finnish
:
Kiiruna
)
is
the
northernmost
city
in
Sweden
,
situated
in
the
province
of
Lapland
.

It
had
00,000
inhabitants
in
0000
and
is
the
seat
of
Kiruna
Municipality
(
pop
.

00,000
in
0000
)
in
Norrbotten
County
.

History
Origins
Archeological
findings
have
shown
that
the
region
around
Kiruna
has
been
inhabited
for
at
least
0,000
years
.

Centuries
before
Kiruna
was
founded
in
0000
,
the
presence
of
iron
ore
at
Kiirunavaara
and
Luossavaara
had
been
known
by
the
local
Sami
population
.

In
0000
,
Samuel
Mört
,
a
bookkeeper
of
the
Kengis
works
,
wrote
on
the
presence
of
iron
in
the
two
hills
.

The
Swedish
senior
enforcement
officer
and
cartographer
and
mapper
Anders
Hackzell
mapped
the
Kiruna
area
in
0000
and
gave
the
mountains
of
the
area
their
Swedish
language
names
Fredriks
berg
(
original
Finnish
name
still
in
use
as
well
:
Kiirunavaara
)
and
Berget
Ulrika
Eleonora
(
original
Finnish
name
still
in
use
as
well
:
Luossavaara
)
,
after
the
King
of
Sweden
Fredrik
I
and
his
wife
Ulrika
Eleonora
.

Despite
the
findings
of
large
amounts
of
ore
,
no
mining
was
initiated
because
of
the
remote
location
and
the
harsh
climate
.

Some
ore
was
extracted
in
the
00th
century
by
extracting
it
in
summer
and
transporting
it
in
winter
,
using
sleds
drawn
by
reindeer
and
horse
s.
However
,
the
costs
were
high
and
the
quality
of
the
phosphor
ous
ore
poor
,
until
,
in
0000
,
the
Gilchrist-Thomas
process
,
invented
by
Sidney
Gilchrist
Thomas
and
Percy
Gilchrist
,
allowed
for
the
separation
of
phosphor
from
the
ore
.

In
0000
,
a
concession
for
a
railway
from
Luleå
to
Narvik
was
granted
to
The
Northern
of
Europe
Railway
Company
.

The
provisional
railway
between
Luleå
and
Malmberget
was
finished
in
0000
and
the
first
train
left
Malmberget
in
March
.

Around
the
same
time
,
the
English
company
went
bankrupt
and
had
to
sell
the
line
to
the
Swedish
state
for
0
million
Swedish
crown
s
,
around
half
the
amount
initially
invested
.

After
a
significant
rebuild
,
the
railway
to
Gällivare
could
be
used
again
and
iron
ore
was
extracted
at
Malmberget
by
Aktiebolaget
Gellivare
Malmfält
(
AGM
)
.

At
the
initiative
of
Robert
Schoug
,
the
Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara
Aktiebolag
(
LKAB
)
was
founded
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Gustaf
Broms
became
CEO
of
both
LKAB
and
AGM
.

LKAB
pressed
for
continuing
Malmbanan
via
Luossavaara
and
Kiirunavaara
to
the
ice-free
coast
of
Norway
.

The
continuation
of
the
railway
line
to
Narvik
was
controversial
,
because
opponents
feared
the
influence
of
Russia
(
then
controlling
Finland
and
already
connected
to
Sweden
at
Haparanda
–
Tornio
)
on
an
international
railway
line
.

The
decision
to
build
was
finally
taken
in
0000
.

The
railway
came
to
Kiruna
00
October
0000
and
the
Swedish
and
Norwegian
sections
were
joined
00
November
0000
.

For
LKAB
,
this
had
been
so
expensive
that
they
could
barely
avoid
bankruptcy
in
0000
,
just
after
the
ore
mining
at
Kiirunavaara
had
started
.

King
Oscar
II
only
opened
the
railway
line
00
July
0000
,
preferring
summer
over
winter
to
travel
north
.

The
architects
Per
Olof
Hallman
and
Gustaf
Wickman
were
appointed
to
design
the
city
,
to
be
built
at
Haukivaara
,
near
both
iron
ore
mines
,
with
then
revolutionary
consideration
of
geographical
and
climatological
circumstances
;
being
built
on
a
hill
,
winter
temperatures
are
much
milder
than
in
other
towns
,
and
due
to
the
street
plan
and
the
positioning
,
wind
is
limited
.

On
00
April
0000
,
Hallmans
plan
was
officially
accepted
.

Gustaf
Broms
proposed
to
name
the
settlements
Kiruna
,
a
short
and
practical
name
that
could
also
be
pronounced
by
Swedish
speaking
inhabitants
.

LKAB
appointed
Hjalmar
Lundbohm
,
who
had
finished
neither
high
school
nor
his
geology
studies
,
as
local
manager
in
Kiruna
.

Early
history
Before
the
design
for
the
settlement
had
been
accepted
,
houses
were
built
in
a
disorganized
manner
with
illegal
slum
s
similar
to
those
in
the
other
mining
town
,
Malmberget
,
south
of
Kiruna
.

Also
,
provisional
buildings
served
as
a
church
,
a
school
,
a
hospital
,
a
hotel
and
a
police
station
.

However
,
official
residences
were
built
at
a
high
pace
,
and
when
the
king
opened
the
railway
in
0000
,
all
illegal
residences
and
most
other
provisional
buildings
had
been
demolished
and
replaced
.

The
very
first
building
,
B
:0
,
is
preserved
and
can
be
seen
at
Hjalmar
Lundbohmsgården
.

In
0000
,
00
people
were
registered
as
living
in
soon-to-be
Kiruna
.

This
increased
to
000
in
0000
,
0,000
in
0000
and
00,000
in
0000
.

The
residences
did
not
fully
keep
up
with
this
rapid
growth
;
by
0000
there
were
0,000
official
rooms
and
some
unrecognised
residences
,
which
meant
that
an
average
of
three
to
four
people
lived
in
a
single
room
;
this
density
decreased
steadily
during
the
decades
to
follow
.

Kiruna
became
a
municipalsamhälle
(
a
community
within
a
municipality
)
in
0000
.

This
caused
unhappiness
in
local
organisations
,
such
as
Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara
Arbetareförening
,
that
had
hoped
for
a
status
as
köping
,
which
would
have
kept
more
of
the
mining
income
inside
the
locality
.

In
return
,
the
mining
company
LKAB
paid
for
a
hospital
,
fire
station
,
sewage
,
roads
,
a
church
(
opened
0000
)
and
the
priest
's
home
.

In
April
0000
,
a
tram
began
operation
in
Kiruna
,
the
northernmost
in
the
world
.

This
meant
miners
would
no
longer
have
to
walk
several
kilometers
through
the
sub-arctic
cold
,
nor
would
they
need
to
climb
a
hundred
meters
up
the
mining
hill
.

The
network
consisted
of
three
lines
:
bergbanan
(
funicular
)
,
stadsspårvägen
(
city
tramway
)
and
gruvspårvägen
(
mine
tramway
)
.

The
funicular
closed
in
0000
after
a
road
up
the
mine
had
been
built
0000
.

The
city
line
had
a
total
length
of
at
longest
and
was
unique
due
to
the
0-meter
gauge
,
double
windows
and
heated
wagons
.

It
closed
in
0000
after
gradually
being
replaced
by
buses
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
a
tram
was
used
inside
the
mine
,
with
wagons
bought
from
closed
down
tramlines
from
all
over
Sweden
.

The
economy
for
iron
ore
was
good
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Before
the
start
of
the
work
,
Hjalmar
Lundbohm
had
been
worried
about
whether
the
Kiruna
winter
would
allow
for
working
outside
at
all
,
but
despite
early
research
into
underground
mining
,
mountaintop
removal
mining
was
the
primary
method
in
the
early
years
.

Mechanisation
was
attempted
early
using
steam
power
ed
excavators
,
but
the
cold
climate
led
to
considerable
difficulties
and
only
when
electrical
machinery
became
available
in
the
0000s
,
significant
mechanisation
was
achieved
.

The
peak
of
Kiirunavaara
,
Statsrådet
,
was
above
Luossajärvi
until
it
was
spectacularly
blown
off
in
0000
.

A
general
strike
hit
Sweden
in
0000
and
Kiruna
was
no
exception
.

Hoping
for
a
better
future
,
thousands
of
people
left
Kiruna
,
including
a
group
of
000
inhabitants
emigrating
to
Brazil
.

Most
of
them
returned
,
disappointed
that
life
in
Latin
America
was
not
what
they
had
hoped
it
to
be
,
Hjalmar
Lundbohm
personally
lent
money
for
the
trip
home
to
some
of
the
emigrants
.

During
World
War
I
,
iron
ore
production
dropped
to
the
lowest
level
in
LKAB
's
history
,
and
when
exports
increased
again
,
a
successful
three-month
strike
in
0000
meant
a
00
%
increase
in
salaries
for
the
miners
.

Production
dropped
to
a
minimum
in
0000
and
a
three-day
workweek
was
introduced
,
but
during
the
fabulous
twenties
it
increased
to
a
record
nine
million
tonnes
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
mining
started
at
the
other
of
the
two
ore
hills
in
Kiruna
,
Luossavaara
.

However
,
the
total
amount
of
ore
that
could
be
mined
in
open
pit
mining
here
was
small
compared
to
Kiirunavaara
,
and
LKAB
preferred
to
concentrate
resources
in
one
place
.

Nevertheless
,
mining
here
continued
until
0000
and
later
it
became
a
research
mine
.

During
the
first
decades
of
Kiruna
's
existence
,
no
road
connected
it
to
the
outside
world
.

The
only
connection
was
by
railway
or
,
as
in
the
time
before
the
railway
,
by
boat
(
in
summer
)
via
the
Torne
and
Kalix
rivers
to
Jukkasjärvi
and
Håmojåkk
and
then
proceed
by
foot
.

A
road
from
Kiruna
was
built
to
Tuolluvaara
in
0000
,
Poikkijärvi
in
0000
,
Alttajärvi
in
0000
and
connected
to
Svappavaara
in
0000
,
from
where
roads
already
connected
via
Vittangi
to
Pajala
and
via
Lappesuando
to
Gällivare
and
further
south
.

The
Great
Depression
led
to
a
00
%
drop
in
ore
production
,
a
drop
that
would
turn
into
a
dramatic
increase
on
the
eve
of
World
War
II
.

Although
some
tourists
had
already
started
coming
to
the
area
in
the
00th
century
,
the
completion
of
the
railway
line
truly
made
tourism
possible
.

Tourists
came
for
the
rivers
and
the
mountains
,
but
also
geologists
and
entire
classes
of
students
came
to
see
the
mine
.

Additionally
,
a
yearly
winter
sports
festival
was
started
,
which
attracted
people
from
a
wide
area
.

The
Sami
population
was
already
a
tourist
attraction
in
the
early
days
of
Kiruna
's
existence
.

World
War
II
The
municipality
of
Kiruna
shares
borders
with
Norway
and
Finland
,
and
Kiruna
is
located
relatively
close
to
both
countries
.

This
led
to
many
soldiers
being
transported
to
the
area
whenever
mobilisation
was
requested
;
first
in
September
0000
after
the
German
invasion
of
Poland
,
then
in
November
0000
after
the
Russian
invasion
of
Finland
,
but
in
both
cases
the
Swedish
soldiers
did
not
engage
in
any
fighting
.

In
March
0000
,
Churchill
requested
permission
to
transport
soldiers
from
Narvik
in
Norway
to
Finland
via
Kiruna
and
Haparanda
in
Operation
Catherine
.

Out
of
fear
that
the
presence
of
British
soldiers
near
the
Kiruna
ore
mine
would
provoke
a
German
attack
on
Sweden
,
the
request
was
declined
.

After
the
German
invasion
of
Norway
,
at
least
ten
soldiers
were
stationed
along
every
bridge
along
Malmbanan
,
preparing
for
the
possibility
to
blow
up
the
bridges
should
the
German
army
invade
Sweden
.

Additionally
,
foreigners
were
banned
from
visiting
Kiruna
or
the
iron
ore
line
,
and
only
the
Sami
,
military
personnel
,
locals
and
people
working
for
the
government
were
permitted
to
travel
between
Kiruna
and
Riksgränsen
.

After
the
battle
at
Bjørnfjell
,
00
April
0000
,
wounded
and
fallen
Norwegian
soldiers
were
transported
to
Kiruna
.

Despite
the
conditions
for
Swedish
neutrality
,
rail
cars
with
food
,
skis
and
helmets
were
transported
from
Kiruna
to
the
Norwegian
soldiers
in
Bjørnfjell
.

Swedish
iron
ore
from
Kiruna
was
of
major
importance
to
the
German
war
machine
.

A
group
of
people
working
at
LKAB
organised
in
the
Wollweberliga
,
planning
to
sabotage
transports
to
Germany
.

In
late
November
0000
,
Edvard
Nyberg
,
Ernst
Wollweber
and
others
produced
a
mine
to
be
attached
to
the
ore
cars
.

Nyberg
was
caught
,
was
fired
from
LKAB
and
spent
0
½
years
in
prison
.

Upon
his
release
,
he
founded
Nybergs
Mekaniska
Verkstad
which
is
still
one
of
Kiruna
's
biggest
companies
[

.

Germany
requested
that
Sweden
provide
use
of
the
railway
network
to
transport
military
equipment
,
but
the
Swedish
government
agreed
only
to
transitering
av
human
karaktär
,
men
ej
underhåll
till
stridande
trupp
(
transit
of
humanitarian
character
,
but
no
supply
of
fighting
soldiers
)
.

Germany
argued
that
,
now
that
Norway
was
occupied
,
the
German
soldiers
there
were
no
longer
fighting
,
and
thus
transported
a
large
amount
of
military
equipment
,
ammunition
and
,
secretly
,
troops
from
south
to
north
Norway
,
via
Malmbanan
and
Kiruna
.

Troops
were
often
transported
in
transports
declared
as
material
transports
.

Despite
being
strictly
against
the
rules
,
there
was
considerable
interaction
between
the
German
soldiers
and
the
Swedish
locals
,
including
trading
and
football
matches
.

During
the
war
,
up
to
0000
refugees
from
00
different
countries
were
kept
in
Kiruna
.

Also
German
prisoners
of
war
,
for
example
from
crashed
airplanes
,
were
kept
in
Kiruna
before
being
transported
south
.

However
,
small-scale
sabotage
,
such
as
sand
in
the
engines
,
was
also
common
and
loose
weapons
often
ended
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
Luossajärvi
lake
,
next
to
the
railway
stop
.

North
of
Torneträsk
,
at
Kaivare
,
a
radio
base
Kari
was
built
in
secrecy
and
used
by
the
Norwegian
resistance
.

It
was
also
used
for
the
smuggling
of
arms
to
Norway
and
refugees
from
Norway
.

Post-war
In
0000
,
Kiruna
gained
city
rights
and
started
to
receive
large
amounts
of
money
from
the
mine
.

The
city
centre
was
renovated
starting
it
0000
;
most
buildings
built
before
0000
were
demolished
and
replaced
,
and
many
of
the
current
buildings
were
built
in
the
following
period
.

The
town
grew
and
new
neighborhoods
were
built
,
as
well
as
new
apartment
buildings
and
villas
in
existing
neighborhoods
.

The
area
currently
known
as
Lombolo
was
built
in
the
0000s
.

After
World
War
II
,
the
economy
of
Kiruna
started
to
diversify
.

Initially
,
the
mechanisation
of
the
mining
industry
led
to
more
mechanical
workshops
developing
machinery
for
the
mine
,
still
dependent
on
the
mining
,
but
individual
companies
with
spinoffs
that
could
be
sold
to
other
areas
than
the
Kiruna
mine
alone
.

In
the
0000s
,
a
fund
,
Norrlandsfonden
was
estabilshed
,
in
which
profits
from
LKAB
would
be
invested
in
order
to
diversify
the
local
economy
.

The
municipality
started
to
lend
money
to
starting
companies
against
very
beneficial
rates
,
a
scheme
that
lasted
until
0000
because
the
banks
,
that
insisted
this
was
false
competition
,
had
established
more
relaxed
rules
for
lending
out
money
.

The
industrial
area
east
of
the
city
was
built
in
the
0000s
to
separate
industry
from
neighborhoods
.

On
00
November
0000
,
Kiruna
Airport
opened
to
separate
civilian
air
traffic
from
the
military
airplanes
that
had
landed
at
Kalixfors
airport
and
at
Luossajärvi
since
World
War
I.
A
road
to
Nikkaluokta
was
opened
in
0000
and
to
Riksgränsen
and
Narvik
in
0000
.

The
latter
had
been
debated
heavily
,
for
alternative
plans
existed
to
build
the
road
to
Norway
on
the
northern
side
of
Torneträsk
,
via
Laimo
,
Kattuvuoma
,
Salmi
to
Innset
and
Bardu
in
Norway
.

This
road
was
never
built
,
but
a
00
km
long
track
between
Laimo
and
Salmi
was
built
at
the
initiatives
of
the
locals
and
finished
in
0000
;
however
,
this
track
,
called
Talmavägen
,
is
not
connected
to
any
other
road
.

Increased
communications
were
also
beneficial
for
tourism
.

Swedish
Railways
had
already
run
special
trains
before
World
War
II
,
but
started
a
special
Dollar
train
in
the
summer
months
between
Gothenborg
and
Kiruna
,
connecting
to
cruise
ships
from
the
United
States
.

The
canoe
club
Kiruna
Långfärdspaddlare
was
founded
in
0000
and
rafting
for
tourists
restarted
after
it
had
been
discontinued
for
00
years
due
to
the
drowning
of
Valfrid
Johansson
.

Until
the
0000s
,
tourism
had
been
mainly
a
summer
business
,
but
touristic
exploitation
of
dog
sledging
was
started
in
0000
in
Jukkasjärvi
.

In
0000
,
the
first
Icehotel
was
built
in
Jukkasjärvi
and
advertised
as
the
worlds
largest
igloo
.

It
had
been
built
using
techniques
from
the
building
of
Malmbanan
00
years
before
,
and
was
also
inspired
by
the
Snow
Festival
,
that
had
started
in
0000
to
celebrate
the
Swedish
Viking
satellite
.

Since
0000
,
a
special
tourist
area
exists
in
the
mine
and
since
0000
,
tourists
can
visit
the
various
areas
of
research
going
on
in
Kiruna
.

In
0000
,
the
Kiruna
Geophysical
Observatory
(
KGO
)
(
now
the
Swedish
Institute
of
Space
Physics
)
was
founded
and
established
by
the
Royal
Swedish
Academy
of
Sciences
.

Esrange
Space
Centre
is
established
in
0000
.

Here
,
rocket
operations
and
ground-based
observations
are
carried
out
since
0000
,
balloon
operations
since
0000
,
satellite
operations
since
0000
and
testing
operations
since
0000
(
with
the
Swedish
Defence
Material
Administration
)
.

ESA
also
operates
a
satellite
station
near
at
Salmajärvi
,
near
Esrange
,
since
0000
.

In
0000
,
Umeå
University
started
a
space
engineering
program
in
Kiruna
,
and
GIS
education
was
started
by
Luleå
University
of
Technology
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
The
Umeå
space
engineers
moved
to
the
same
building
housing
IRF
and
a
year
later
another
Luleå
University
programme
,
civil
engineering
with
specialisation
in
space
technology
,
started
at
the
same
location
.

Since
0000
,
the
Erasmus
Mundus
Master
Course
in
Space
Science
and
Technology
has
started
with
at
least
one
semester
spent
at
LTU
.

In
0000
,
education
along
IRV
was
split
and
only
the
Department
of
Space
Science
,
belonging
to
Luleå
University
of
Technology
,
remained
,
while
the
Umeå
University
programme
in
Space
Engineering
quit
.

The
Kiruna
Icehotel
has
been
built
in
Jukkasjärvi
each
winter
since
0000
and
has
become
a
major
tourist
attraction
.

Until
the
0000s
,
Kiruna
's
population
steadily
increased
as
the
iron
ore
economy
was
thriving
.

0000
was
a
record
year
for
the
iron
ore
company
LKAB
,
mining
00
million
ton
ore
from
Kiruna
and
nearby
Svappavaara
.

However
,
a
steel
crisis
led
to
a
dramatic
decrease
in
the
iron
ore
economy
,
and
LKAB
had
losses
in
0000
for
the
first
time
in
decades
.

Additionally
,
increasing
transport
capacity
meant
increasing
competition
from
Africa
,
South
America
and
Australia
,
where
mining
is
mostly
done
in
the
open
and
thus
cheaper
.

In
ten
years
the
number
of
employees
decreased
from
0,000
to
0,000
and
the
population
of
Kiruna
began
to
drop
.

The
mines
at
Svappavaara
,
Tuolluvaara
and
Luossavaara
closed
and
only
Kirunavaara
remained
.

The
local
job
office
was
jocularly
called
Resebyrån
(
the
travel
agency
)
because
the
only
message
to
unemployed
youths
was
:
move
.

Since
then
,
the
population
has
gone
steadily
downhill
,
but
has
stabilised
in
recent
years
due
to
the
diversification
of
the
economy
.

Since
0000
,
the
snow
festival
has
been
organised
each
winter
,
including
various
activities
such
as
an
ice
sculpture
contest
.

In
0000
,
when
the
city
was
000
years
old
,
the
Kiruna
festival
was
first
organised
and
has
since
been
organised
every
year
in
summer
.

Geography
Kiruna
is
located
in
the
north
of
Sweden
,
north
of
the
Arctic
circle
.

The
city
centre
is
built
on
the
Haukavaara
hill
at
an
altitude
of
000m
,
high
above
the
Torne
river
to
the
north
and
the
Kalix
river
to
the
south
.

Other
parts
of
the
town
are
Lombolo
and
Tuolluvaara
.

Near
Kiruna
are
the
mountains
Kiirunavaara
and
Luossavaara
.

Kiirunavaara
is
an
iron
ore
mine
that
is
the
town
's
primary
economic
resource
.

Luossavaara
is
a
former
mine
and
now
used
as
a
skiing
slope
.

The
city
is
built
near
the
lake
Luossajärvi
with
outflow
to
the
Luossajoki
that
flows
in
the
Torne
river
at
Laxforsen
.

The
area
around
Kiruna
is
very
sparsely
populated
.

The
northwest
,
west
and
southwest
of
Kiruna
are
dominated
by
the
Scandinavian
mountains
,
visible
from
the
city
centre
.

Swedens
highest
mountain
,
Kebnekaise
,
is
from
the
city
centre
and
can
be
seen
from
it
as
well
.

To
the
west
is
Nikkaluokta
and
to
the
northwest
are
Abisko
,
Björkliden
,
Riksgränsen
and
the
Norwegian
town
of
Narvik
,
via
the
road
.

north
of
Kiruna
is
Kurravaara
,
on
the
edge
of
the
Torne
River
.

The
land
north
of
Kurravaara
is
roadless
,
uninhabited
land
,
partly
barren
and
partly
birch
forest
,
up
to
the
Norwegian
and
Finnish
borders
at
Treriksröset
.

The
lower-lying
east
is
dominated
by
boreal
forest
,
stretching
hundreds
(
if
not
thousands
)
of
kilometers
into
Finland
and
Russia
.

Around
00
km
east
of
Kiruna
is
a
group
of
villages
at
the
Torne
River
,
most
notably
Jukkasjärvi
,
where
an
ice
hotel
is
built
in
winter
,
attracting
tourists
from
all
over
the
world
.

The
twin
cities
Gällivare
and
Malmberget
are
some
000
km
south
of
Kiruna
.

Kiruna
became
a
Swedish
city
on
January
0
,
0000
,
and
was
at
one
time
listed
as
the
largest
city
in
the
world
by
area
,
even
if
most
of
its
territory
of
course
was
non-urban
.

After
the
Swedish
municipality
reform
in
the
0000s
,
the
term
"
city
"
has
been
legally
discontinued
.

Today
only
the
built-up
area
is
considered
a
de
facto
city
.

Climate
Being
located
000
kilometres
north
of
the
Arctic
Circle
,
Kiruna
has
a
Sub-Arctic
climate
with
short
,
cool
summers
and
long
,
cold
winters
,
although
the
city
itself
can
be
considerably
milder
than
the
surrounding
forest
.

Snowcover
generally
lasts
from
mid-October
to
mid-May
,
but
snowfall
can
occur
year-round
.

The
sun
does
n't
set
between
May
00
and
July
00
,
and
perpetual
daylight
lasts
from
early
May
to
early
August
.

The
period
that
the
sun
does
n't
rise
lasts
from
early
December
to
early
January
,
the
exact
boundaries
depending
on
local
topography
.

In
this
time
of
the
year
,
a
few
hours
of
twilight
are
the
only
daylight
available
.

During
the
midnight
sun
period
,
temperatures
can
rise
as
high
as
00
degrees
Celsius
(
00
F
)
.

Communications
Kiruna
is
located
at
the
E00
road
,
connecting
Luleå
with
Norway
and
passing
close
by
Gällivare
(
south
of
Kiruna
)
and
Narvik
(
on
the
Norwegian
coast
)
.

A
short
road
connects
to
Kurravaara
at
the
Torne
river
and
ends
there
.

Another
road
connects
Kiruna
with
Nikkaluokta
close
to
Kebnekaise
and
is
used
by
tourists
to
get
to
the
mountains
.

It
also
passes
by
or
nearby
several
villages
in
the
Kalix
river
valley
.

Buses
connect
Kiruna
with
major
towns
in
Norrbotten
province
and
villages
nearby
and
in
the
wider
region
.

The
railway
connects
Luleå
with
Gällivare
,
Kiruna
and
Narvik
.

Although
built
to
serve
the
mine
,
Swedish
Rail
runs
daily
passenger
traffic
on
the
line
:
a
night
train
from
Narvik
to
Stockholm
,
a
day
train
from
Narvik
to
Luleå
(
connecting
with
a
second
night
train
to
Stockholm
and
Göteborg
)
,
and
trains
to
Luleå
and
Narvik
that
start
and
finish
in
Kiruna
.

The
latter
is
known
as
Karven
and
popular
for
day
trips
to
the
mountains
near
Abisko
,
Björkliden
and
Riksgränsen
,
particularly
in
winter
.

Additional
long-distance
trains
are
run
by
Connex
in
summer
.

Kiruna
Airport
is
located
southeast
of
the

.

A
few
flights
per
day
connect
Kiruna
with
Stockholm
,
either
directly
or
via
Luleå
or
Umeå
.

During
tourist
season
,
buses
connect
Kiruna
Airport
to
the
city
center
.

Economy
Mine
Iron
ore
extraction
is
a
key
industry
of
the
area
,
and
the
town
is
very
dependent
on
the
mining
company
LKAB
.

During
World
War
II
,
large
quantities
of
iron
were
transported
from
northern
Sweden
by
rail
to
the
east
coast
,
and
further
down
to
be
sold
to
Germany
.

.

In
recent
years
attempts
have
been
made
to
reduce
the
area
's
dependence
on
mining
with
initiatives
to
promote
science
,
R&D
and
government
related
activities
.

Initiatives
have
included
the
proposed
relocation
of
the
Swedish
Space
Corporation
and
the
establishment
of
the
Environment
and
Space
Research
Institute
(
Miljö
-
och
rymdforskningsinstitutet
)
;
the
former
was
never
executed
and
the
latter
was
essentially
only
a
temporary
success
.

Space
research
The
ESTRACK
Kiruna
Station
of
ESA
,
the
European
Space
Agency
,
is
located
in
the
municipality
.

So
is
Esrange
,
the
European
Space
and
Sounding
Rocket
Range
,
as
well
as
an
EISCAT
station
and
EISCAT
scientific
headquarters
.

Also
in
Kiruna
are
the
Institute
of
Space
Physics
and
the
Department
of
Space
Science
belonging
to
Luleå
University
of
Technology
.

In
0000
,
the
Swedish
government
announced
that
Kiruna
would
be
the
host
of
Spaceport
Sweden
,
signing
an
agreement
with
Virgin
Galactic
.

Tourism
Tourism
is
an
important
source
of
income
for
Kiruna
and
the
surrounding
region
with
around
000,000
tourist-nights
per
year
(
0000
)
.

Throughout
the
year
,
fishing
and
hunting
are
popular
activities
by
both
locals
and
tourists
.

Visits
can
be
done
to
the
mine
,
the
church
and
different
research
agencies
,
such
as
Abisko
Scientific
Research
Station
the
Institute
of
Space
Physics
or
Esrange
.

Tourists
can
experience
the
sami
culture
,
particularly
in
combination
with
winter
activities
such
as
dog
sledding
.

In
summer
,
many
come
to
the
mountains
to
hike
up
to
Kebnekaise
,
to
walk
on
trails
such
as
Kungsleden
and
Nordkalottruta
,
or
to
hike
in
the
national
parks
such
as
Abisko
National
Park
.

The
location
north
of
the
arctic
circle
attracts
tourists
for
experiencing
the
midnight
sun
.

Tourists
also
come
for
the
lakes
and
rivers
of
Lapland
.

There
exists
rafting
on
the
Kalix
and
Torne
rivers
,
canoeing
in
the
Vistas
valley
near
Nikkaluokta
,
and
boat
trips
on
lakes
such
as
Torneträsk
.

Caving
can
be
done
near
Björkliden
.

Each
year
in
summer
,
the
Kiruna
festival
is
organised
,
a
music
festival
in
the
midnight
sun
.

In
winter
,
the
Icehotel
attracts
tourists
from
all
over
the
world
.

The
northern
location
makes
it
a
good
place
to
observe
the
northern
lights
,
and
snow
cover
generally
lasts
from
October
to
May
.

The
long
and
certain
snow
cover
,
with
frozen
lakes
and
river
Torne
,
makes
it
a
good
place
for
winter
adventures
,
skiing
(
cross-country
and
alpine
)
,
dog
sledding
or
driving
a
snowmobile
.

Ice
climbing
can
be
done
in
the
mountains
and
sometimes
one
can
go
ice
skating
on
lakes
or
rivers
.

Each
year
in
winter
,
the
Snow
festival
is
organized
over
the
last
weekend
of
January
,
[

Moving
the
town
The
re-development
of
Kiruna
is
a
reconstruction
project
of
Kiruna
,
as
the
Kirunavaara
mine
,
run
by
LKAB
,
undermines
the
current
town
center
.

Several
buildings
are
to
be
moved
or
demolished
.

The
town
center
is
to
be
moved
0
kilometers
to
the
east
.

The
ground
deformations
became
apparent
in
0000
,
and
the
redevelopment
started
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
it
was
decided
that
the
present
centre
of
the
municipality
would
have
to
be
relocated
to
counter
mining-related
subsidence
.

The
relocation
would
be
made
gradually
over
the
coming
decade
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
a
new
location
was
proposed
.

Kiruna
would
gradually
move
northwest
to
the
foot
of
the
Luossavaara
mountain
,
by
the
lake
of
Luossajärvi
.

The
first
actual
work
on
moving
the
town
was
done
in
November
0000
,
when
work
on
the
new
main
sewage
pipe
started
.

In
the
same
week
,
first
sketches
for
the
layout
of
the
new
part
of
the
town
became
available
.

The
sketches
include
a
travel
centre
,
the
new
locations
for
the
city
hall
and
the
church
,
an
artificial
lake
and
an
extension
of
the
Luossavaara
hill
into
the
city
.

The
location
of
the
new
section
of
the
E00
is
still
uncertain
,
as
is
the
location
of
the
railway
and
the
railway
station
.

A
more
official
sketch
was
published
early
in
spring
0000
,
which
was
then
discussed
with
various
interest
groups
before
a
further
version
is
to
be
produced
.

Most
of
the
buildings
in
Kiruna
will
simply
be
torn
down
and
rebuilt
at
the
target
site
.

However
,
the
Kiruna
city
hall
,
the
most
architecturally
significant
building
in
Kiruna
,
will
be
cut
into
four
parts
,
each
of
which
will
be
transported
whole
to
the
target
site
and
reassembled
there
.

The
move
will
require
an
extremely
flat
and
level
road
tens
of
metres
wide
and
will
be
extremely
slow
.

In
June
0000
,
the
municipal
council
decided
that
the
town
would
be
moved
eastwards
(
to
)
,
in
the
direction
of
Tuolluvaara
,
instead
of
the
proposed
northwestern
location
.

Sights
In
the
village
of
Jukkasjärvi
,
there
is
an
ice
hotel
which
is
reconstructed
annually
for
the
winter
.

Kiruna
Church
,
built
in

is
one
of
Sweden
's
largest

buildings
.

The
church
exterior
is
built
in
a
Gothic
Revival
style
,
while
the
altar
is
in

It
has

been
voted
Sweden
's
best-looking

and
the
foremost

History
John
Eves
,
a
native
of
Ireland
living
in
Mill
Creek
Hundred
,
Delaware
,
is
thought
to
have
been
one
of
the
first
white
men
to
visit
the
Greenwood
Valley
and
Little
Fishing
Creek
area
in
0000
.

(
One
account
of
this
visit
indicates
that
he
purchased
a
sizeable
portion
of
the
land
he
explored
in
the
area
from
the
Indians
who
had
served
as
his
guides
on
this
trek
.
)

Although
he
returned
to
Delaware
after
this
initial
visit
,
he
returned
the
following
year
with
his
son
Thomas
and
built
a
log
cabin
on
the
property
.

The
entire
Eves
family
arrived
the
next
year
,
in
0000
,
and
began
tilling
the
fields
adjacent
to
the
cabin
as
soon
as
they
could
be
cleared
.

In
0000
,
the
Eves
family
received
a
deed
for
their
property
in
the
Valley
’
the
largest
land
holding
at
the
time
in
what
would
later
become
Columbia
County
.

Title
for
the
land
,
originally
obtained
by
William
and
Elizabeth
McMean
in
0000
,
was
passed
to
Reuben
Haines
,
and
then
to
John
Eves
.

An
Indian
uprising
,
the
Battle
of
Wyoming
,
in
mid-summer
of
0000
,
caused
the
Eves
family
to
flee
their
home
in
the
Valley
and
take
refuge
at
a
stockade
near
Washingtonville
.

Upon
their
return
in
0000
,
they
found
their
cabin
burned
and
their
fields
overgrown
,
but
immediately
set
about
to
recreate
their
homestead
.

When
the
Eves
family
returned
in
the
mid-0000s
,
they
were
determined
to
make
the
settlement
permanent
.

They
were
accompanied
or
were
soon
followed
by
several
other
families
,
including
Masters
,
Kisner
,
Battin
,
Parker
,
Lundy
,
Lemon
,
Oliver
,
and
Rich
.

With
00
children
and
000
grandchildren
,
John
Eves
looked
after
the
building
of
homes
for
the
family
,
a
grist
mill
that
was
to
stand
for
000
years
,
and
later
a
sawmill
and
several
other
essential
structures
.

Growth
of
the
community
was
slow
because
it
was
not
located
along
a
main
traveled
route
or
major
waterway
.

Until
0000
,
Indian
trails
,
which
crossed
at
Millville
,
were
the
only
accessways
to
the
Valley
area
.

In
that
year
,
a
road
was
surveyed
across
the
Mount
Pleasant
hills
to
the
Susquehanna
River
.

It
was
0000
through
before
the
road
from
Bloomsburg
to
Laporte
was
laid
out
through
Millville
.

Early
residents
were
almost
entirely
self-sufficient
.

Thomas
Eves
succeeded
his
father
in
ownership
of
the
grist
mill
and
built
the
first
house
in
what
is
now
Millville
Borough
.

And
,
according
to
an
early
historian
,
David
and
Andrew
Eves
opened
the
first
store
in
the
area
in
0000
.

David
Eves
was
also
commissioned
the
first
postmaster
in
0000
,
followed
by
his
brother
Andrew
some
years
later
.

While
the
early
population
was
scattered
,
provision
was
made
for
both
worship
and
education
.

In
the
early
years
of
the
community
,
services
and
classes
were
held
in
the
homes
,
but
in
0000
,
a
school
was
started
in
Millville
and
a
two-room
Meeting
House
was
erected
in
0000
.

Local
industry
at
the
time
consisted
of
those
operations
which
were
necessary
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
early
population
.

Sawmill
s
and
grist
mills
were
the
first
,
followed
by
a
woolen
mill
,
started
in
0000
by
John
Watson
,
several
brick
plants
,
and
a
wagon
shop
,
established
by
Charles
Eves
,
in
0000
.

One
spurt
of
growth
in
Millville
occurred
in
0000
when
the
road
from
Bloomsburg
to
Laporte
was
constructed
.

The
town
experienced
considerable
growth
in
the
years
following
construction
of
this
roadway
because
the
community
now
had
adequate
access
to
markets
and
other
transportation
links
in
Bloomsburg
.

A
second
period
of
growth
was
experienced
in
0000
when
the
railroad
was
constructed
through
town
.

Numerous
businesses
and
industries
were
created
and
buildings
were
erected
to
service
the
railroad
.

A
local
newspaper
,
the
Weekly
Tablet
,
published
its
first
edition
in
April
0000
.

A
helmet
is
a
form
of
protective
gear
worn
on
the
head
to
protect
it
from
injuries
.

Ceremonial
or
symbolic
helmets
(
e.g.
,
UK
policeman
's
helmet
)
without
protective
function
are
sometimes
used
.

The
oldest
known
use
of
helmets
was
by
Assyrian
soldiers
in
000BC
,
who
wore
thick
leather
or
bronze
helmets
to
protect
the
head
from
blunt
object
and
sword
blows
and
arrow
strikes
in
combat
.

Soldiers
still
wear
helmets
,
now
often
made
from
lightweight
plastic
materials
.

In
civilian
life
,
helmets
are
used
for
recreational
activities
and
sports
(
e.g.
,
jockey
s
in
horse
racing
,
American
football
,
ice
hockey
,
cricket
,
baseball
,
and
rock
climbing
)
;
dangerous
work
activities
(
e.g.
,
construction
,
mining
,
riot
police
)
;
and
transportation
(
e.g.
,
Motorcycle
helmet
s
and
bicycle
helmet
s
)
.

Since
the
0000s
,
most
helmets
are
made
from
resin
or
plastic
,
which
may
be
reinforced
with
fibers
such
as
aramid
s.
The
word
helmet
is
diminutive
from
helm
,
Medieval
word
for
combat
protective
headgear
.

The
Medieval
great
helm
covers
the
whole
head
and
often
is
accompanied
with
camail
protecting
throat
and
neck
as
well
.

Originally
a
helmet
was
a
helm
which
covered
the
head
only
partly
.

Design
All
helmets
attempt
to
protect
the
user
's
head
by
absorbing
mechanical
energy
and
protecting
against
penetration
.

Their
structure
and
protective
capacity
are
altered
in
high-energy
impacts
.

Beside
their
energy-absorption
capability
,
their
volume
and
weight
are
also
important
issues
,
since
higher
volume
and
weight
increase
the
injury
risk
for
the
user
's
head
and
neck
.

Anatomical
helmets
adapted
to
the
inner
head
structure
were
invented
by
neurosurgeons
at
the
end
of
the
00th
century
.

Helmets
used
for
different
purposes
have
different
designs
.

For
example
,
a
bicycle
helmet
must
protect
against
blunt
impact
forces
from
the
wearer
's
head
striking
the
road
.

A
helmet
designed
for
rock
climbing
must
protect
against
heavy
impact
,
and
against
objects
such
as
small
rocks
and
climbing
equipment
falling
from
above
.

Practical
concerns
also
dictate
helmet
design
:
a
bicycling
helmet
should
be
aerodynamic
in
shape
and
well
ventilated
,
while
a
rock
climbing
helmet
must
be
lightweight
and
small
so
that
it
does
not
interfere
with
climbing
.

Some
helmets
have
other
protective
elements
attached
to
them
,
such
as
a
face
visor
s
or
goggles
or
a
face
cage
,
and
ear
plug
s
and
other
forms
of
protective
headgear
,
and
a
communications
system
.

Sports
helmets
may
have
an
integrated
metal
face
protector
(
face
cage
)
.

Materials
Historically
,
helmets
have
been
made
from
a
wide
range
of
materials
,
including
various
metals
,
plastics
,
leather
,
and
even
some
fibrous
materials
such
as
Kevlar
.

Ancient
and
medieval
helmets
were
usually
made
of
metals
,
often
bronze
,
iron
or
steel
,
though
some
boar
's
tusk
helmet
s
were
known
to
ancient
Mycenea
.

Some
British
gamekeeper
s
during
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
wore
helmets
made
of
straw
bound
together
with
cut
bramble
.

Developed
in
the
mid-00th
century
,
the
pith
helmet
,
made
of
pith
or
cork
,
was
often
worn
by
Europeans
in
the
tropics
.

Military
applications
in
the
00th-00th
centuries
saw
a
number
of
leather
helmets
,
particularly
among
aviation
and
tank
er
crews
in
the
early
00th
century
.

In
the
early
days
of
the
automobile
,
some
motorists
also
adopted
this
style
of
headgear
,
and
early
football
helmet
s
were
also
made
of
leather
.

In
World
War
II
,
American
,
Soviet
,
German
,
Italian
and
French
flight
crews
wore
leather
helmets
,
the
Germans
disguising
theirs
under
a
beret
before
disposing
of
both
and
switching
to
cloth
caps
.

The
era
of
the
First
and
Second
World
Wars
also
saw
a
resurgence
of
metal
military
helmets
,
most
notably
the
Brodie
helmet
and
the
Stahlhelm
.

Modern
helmets
have
a
much
wider
range
of
applications
,
including
helmets
adapted
to
the
specific
needs
of
many
athletic
pursuits
and
work
environments
,
and
these
very
often
incorporate
plastics
and
other
synthetic
materials
for
their
light
weight
and
shock
absorption
capabilities
.

Some
types
of
synthetic
fibers
used
to
make
helmets
in
the
00st
century
include
Aramid
,
Kevlar
and
Twaron
.

Types
of
helmets
Helmets
of
many
different
types
have
developed
over
the
course
of
human
history
.

Most
early
helmets
had
military
uses
,
though
some
may
have
had
more
ceremonial
than
combat-related
purposes
.

Two
important
helmet
types
to
develop
in
antiquity
were
the
Corinthian
helmet
and
the
Roman
galea
.

During
the
Middle
Ages
,
many
different
military
helmets
and
some
ceremonial
helmets
were
developed
,
almost
all
of
these
being
made
of
metals
.

Some
of
the
more
important
medieval
developments
included
the
great
helm
,
the
bascinet
,
the
frog-mouth
helm
and
the
armet
.

In
the
00th
century
,
more
materials
were
incorporated
,
namely
leather
,
felt
and
pith
.

The
pith
helmet
and
the
leather
pickelhaube
were
important
00th
century
developments
.

The
greatest
expansion
in
the
variety
of
forms
and
composition
of
helmets
,
however
,
took
place
in
the
00th
century
,
with
the
development
of
highly
specialized
helmets
for
a
multitude
of
athletic
and
professional
applications
,
as
well
as
the
advent
of
modern
plastic
s.
During
World
War
I
,
the
French
army
developed
the
Adrian
helmet
,
the
British
developed
the
Brodie
helmet
,
and
the
Germans
produced
the
Stahlhelm
.

Flight
helmet
s
were
also
developed
throughout
the
00th
century
.

A
multitude
of
athletic
helmets
,
including
football
helmet
s
,
batting
helmet
s
,
cricket
helmet
s
,
bicycle
helmet
s
,
motorcycle
helmet
s
and
racing
helmet
s
,
were
also
developed
in
the
00th
century
.

Helmets
since
the
mid-00th
century
have
often
incorporated
lightweight
plastics
and
other
synthetic
materials
,
and
their
use
has
become
highly
specialized
.

Some
important
recent
developments
include
the
French
SPECTRA
helmet
,
American
PASGT
(
commonly
called
"
Kevlar
"
by
U.S.
troops
)
and
Advanced
Combat
Helmet
,
or
ACH
.

A
more
complete
list
of
helmet
types
can
be
found
below
.

Heraldry
As
the
coat
of
arms
was
originally
designed
to
distinguish
noble
combatants
on
the
battlefield
or
in
a
tournament
,
even
while
covered
in
armour
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
heraldic
elements
constantly
incorporated
the
shield
and
the
helmet
,
these
often
being
the
most
visible
parts
of
a
knight
's
military
equipment
.

The
common
practice
was
to
display
a
helmet
as
part
of
the
coat
of
arms
,
above
the
shield
,
a
practice
maintained
long
after
helmets
themselves
ceased
to
be
used
.

In
German
heraldry
,
the
helmet
was
even
considered
to
be
inseparable
from
the
shield
,
in
contrast
to
English
heraldry
,
where
the
practice
of
displaying
the
helmet
and
crest
alone
with
no
shield
whatsoever
came
into
vogue
in
Victorian
times
.

In
most
post-medieval
heraldic
traditions
,
the
style
,
colour
and
position
of
the
helmet
became
emblematic
of
the
rank
of
the
bearer
.

Rank
was
also
often
denoted
by
a
coronet
,
usually
either
surmounting
the
shield
or
placed
upon
the
helmet
.

The
practice
of
indicating
peerage
through
the
display
of
barred
or
grilled
helmets
first
appeared
around
0000-0000
,
and
the
heraldic
convention
of
displaying
helmets
of
rank
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
which
came
into
vogue
around
Stuart
times
,
is
as
follows
:
Earlier
rolls
of
arms
reveal
,
however
,
that
early
heraldic
helmets
were
depicted
in
a
manner
faithful
to
the
styles
in
actual
military
or
tournament
use
at
the
time
.

History
The

Hellefors
Bruks
AB
,

in
the
early
00th
century
was
one

,
mechanical
wood
pulp

sawn
timber
,
joinery
and
box
board
s.
It
mined
,
for
its
own
requirements
and
for
sale
,
ore
from
its
own
iron
ore
fields

At
a
large
number
of
its
own
power
station

Meadville
is
a
city
in

the
county
seat
of
Crawford
County
,
Pennsylvania
,

States
.

The
city
is
within
00
miles
of

,
Pennsylvania
and
00
miles
of
Pittsburgh
,
PA
.

It
was
the
first
permanent
settlement
in
northwest
Pennsylvania
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
city
of

is
part
of
the
Meadville
,
PA
Micropolitan

Area
.

History
Meadville
was
founded
on
May
00
,
0000
by
a
party
of
settlers
led
by
David
Mead
.

Its
location
was
chosen
well
,
for
it
lies
at
the
confluence
of
Cussewago
Creek
and
French
Creek
,
and
is
only
a
day
's
travel
by
boat
to
the
safety
of
Ft.
Franklin
.

Their
settlement
was
in
a
large
meadow
,
first
cleared
by
Native
Americans
led
by
Chief
Custaloga
,
and
well
suited
for
growing
maize
.

The
village
Custaloga
built
here
was
known
as
Cussewago
.

The
neighboring
Iroquois
and
Lenape
befriended
the
isolated
settlement
,
but
their
enemies
,
including
the
Wyandot
s
,
were
not
so
amiable
.

The
threat
of
their
attacks
caused
the
settlement
to
be
evacuated
for
a
time
in
0000
.

Around
0000
,
many
of
the
settlers
to
the
Meadville
area
came
after
receiving
land
bounties
for
service
in
the

War
.

in
Meadville
in
0000
and
is
the
oldest
college
west
of
the
Allegheny
Mountains
that
has
kept
its
original
name
.

Meadville
became
an
important
transportation
center
after
construction
of
the
French
Creek
Feeder
Canal
in
0000
and
of
the
Beaver
and
Erie
Canal
it
connected
to
at
Conneaut
Lake
and
subsequent
railroad
development
.

Meadville
Theological
School
was
established
in
0000
by
a
wealthy
businessman
and
Unitarian
named
Harm
Jan
Huidekoper
.

It
moved
to
Chicago
in
0000
.

In
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
Meadville
played
a
small
part
in
the
Underground
Railroad
helping
escaping
slaves
to
freedom
.

An
event
in
September
0000
led
to
the
end
of
segregation
by
race
in
the
state
's
public
schools
.

At
the
South
Ward
schools
,
Elias
Allen
tried
unsuccessfully
to
enroll
his
two
children
.

He
appealed
to
the
Crawford
County
Court
of
Common
Pleas
,
and
Judge
Pearson
Church
declared
unconstitutional
the
0000
state
law
mandating
separate
schools
for
Negro
children
.

This
law
was
amended
,
effective
July
0
,
0000
,
to
prohibit
such
segregation
.

By
the
late
00th
century
,
Meadville
's
economy
was
also
driven
by
logging
,
agriculture
,
and
iron
production
.

The
Talon
Corporation
,
headquartered
in
Meadville
,
played
a
major
role
in
the
development
of
the
zipper
.

Since
the
clothing
industry
was
largely
unaffected
by
the
Great
Depression
,
the
community
saw
a
population
boom
at
that
time
.

During
World
War
II
,
the
nearby
Keystone
Ordnance
plant
brought
additional
jobs
to
the
area
.

After
the
war
,
Meadville
's
industrial
growth
continued
.

Talon
remained
a
major
employer
,
along
with
the
Erie
Railroad
,
American
Viscose
(
later
known
as
Avtex
Fibers
)
,
Channellock
tools
,
and
Dad
's
Pet
Food
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
Great
Lakes
region
saw
a
decline
in
heavy
industry
.

By
the
early
0000s
,
Channellock
and
Dad
's
were
the
only
large
companies
operating
in
Meadville
.

This
blow
to
the
local
economy
was
softened
by
subsequent
surge
in
light
industry
,
mainly
tool
and
die
machine
shops
,
earning
Meadville
the
nickname
Tool
City
,
USA
.

The
area
has
seen
growth
in
the
0000s
and
first
decade
of
the
00st
century
.

The
song
"
Bittersweet
Motel
"
by
Vermont
jam
band
,
Phish
,
was
inspired
when
keyboardist
,
Page
McConnell
,
left
a
wedding
in
Meadville
and
drove
down
to
the
Pittsburgh
Airport
.

In

Titusville
is
a
city
in
Crawford
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
,
and
is
part
of
the
Meadville
,
PA
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
History
The
area
was
first
settled
in
0000
by
Jonathan
Titus
.

Within
00
years
,
others
bought
and
improved
the
land
lying
near
him
,
along
the
banks
of
the
now-named
Oil
Creek
.

He
named
the
village
Edinburg
(
h
)
,
but
as
the
village
grew
,
the
settlers
began
to
call
this
little
hamlet
Titusville
.

The
village
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

Lumber
was
the
principal
industry
with
at
least
00
sawmills
in
the
area
.

The
Titusville
City
Hall
and
Titusville
Historic
District
are
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

Oil
rush
Titusville
was
a
slow-growing
and
peaceful
community
until
the
0000s
,
when
the
discovery
of
petroleum
in
the
region
caused
quite
the
stir
.

Oil
was
known
to
exist
here
,
but
there
was
no
practical
way
to
extract
it
.

Generally
,
its
main
use
to
that
time
had
been
as
a
medicine
for
both
animals
and
humans
.

In
the
late
0000s
Seneca
Oil
Company
(
formerly
the
Pennsylvania
Rock
Oil
Company
)
sent
Col.
Edwin
L.
Drake
,
to
start
drilling
on
a
piece
of
leased
land
just
south
of
Titusville
near
what
is
now
Oil
Creek
State
Park
.

Drake
hired
a
salt
well
driller
,
William
A.
Smith
,
in
the
summer
of
0000
.

They
had
many
difficulties
,
but
on
August
00
at
the
site
of
an
oil
spring
just
south
of
Titusville
,
they
finally
drilled
a
well
that
could
be
commercially
successful
.

Teamster
s
were
needed
immediately
to
transport
the
oil
to
markets
.

Transporting
methods
improved
and
in
0000
the
Oil
Creek
&
Titusville
Railroad
was
built
between
Titusville
and
Corry
where
it
was
transferred
to
other
,
larger
,
east-west
lines
.

In
0000
pipelines
were
laid
directly
to
the
rail
line
and
the
demand
for
teamsters
practically
ended
.

The
next
year
the
railroad
line
was
extended
south
to
Petroleum
Centre
and
Oil
City
.

The
Union
City
&
Titusville
Railroad
was
built
in
0000
,
which
became
part
of
the
Philadelphia
&
Erie
Railroad
in
0000
.

That
fall
,
President
U.
S.
Grant
visited
Titusville
to
view
this
important
region
.

Other
oil-related
businesses
quickly
exploded
on
the
scene
.

Eight
refineries
were
built
between
0000
and
0000
.

Drilling
tools
were
needed
and
several
iron
works
were
built
.

Titusville
grew
from
000
residents
to
00,000
almost
overnight
and
in
0000
it
incorporated
as
a
city
.

In
0000
,
the
first
oil
exchange
in
the
United
States
was
established
here
.

The
exchange
moved
from
the
city
,
but
returned
in
0000
in
a
new
,
brick
building
before
being
dissolved
in
0000
.

The
first
oil
millionaire
was
Jonathan
Watson
,
a
resident
of
Titusville
.

He
owned
the
land
where
Drake
's
well
was
drilled
.

He
had
been
a
partner
in
a
lumber
business
prior
to
the
success
of
the
Drake
well
.

At
one
time
it
was
said
that
Titusville
had
more
millionaires
per
0,000
population
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.

One
resident
of
note
was
Franklin
S.
Tarbell
whose
large
Italianate
home
still
stands
.

He
first
moved
a
few
miles
south
in
Venango
County
and
established
a
wooden
stock
tank
business
.

About
southeast
of
Titusville
was
another
oil
boom
city
,
Pithole
.

Oil
was
discovered
in
a
rolling
meadow
there
in
January
0000
and
by
September
0000
the
population
was
00,000
.

But
the
oil
soon
ran
dry
and
within
four
years
the
city
was
nearly
deserted
.

Tarbell
moved
to
Titusville
in
0000
.

His
daughter
,
Ida
Minerva
Tarbell
,
grew
up
amidst
the
sounds
and
smells
of
the
oil
industry
.

She
became
an
accomplished
writer
and
wrote
a
series
of
articles
about
the
business
practices
of
the
Standard
Oil
Company
and
its
president
,
John
D.
Rockefeller
,
which
sparked
legislative
action
in
Congress
concerning
monopolies
.

Fire
was
always
a
fearful
concern
around
oil
and
one
of
the
worst
was
on
June
00
,
0000
.

It
came
to
be
known
as
"
Black
Friday
,
"
when
almost
of
oil
burned
after
an
oil
tank
was
hit
by
lightning
.

The
fire
raged
for
three
days
until
it
finally
was
brought
under
control
.

Although
the
oil
was
valued
at
$
0
million
,
there
was
no
loss
of
life
.

Another
fire
occurred
on
June
0
,
0000
,
when
Oil
Creek
flooded
and
a
tank
of
petroleum
ether
overturned
.

The
petroleum
ether
ignited
and
in
the
ensuing
explosions
00
men
,
women
and
children
died
.

Another
lightning
strike
in
0000
resulted
in
lost
in
a
fire
.

Oil
production
in
Pennsylvania
peaked
in
0000
,
when
other
industries
arose
in
Titusville
.

The
iron
and
steel
industries
dominated
the
town
in
the
early
twentieth
century
with
lumber
eventually
reclaiming
its
former
cachet
.

Oil
is
still
relevant
,
however
.

Charter
Plastics
Company
,
now
located
in
a
building
that
once
manufactured
pressure
vessels
,
stationary
engines
and
boilers
for
the
oil
industry
,
uses
oil
in
its
production
process
.

Boiling
Springs
is
a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
in
South
Middleton
Township
,
Cumberland
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
,
and
is
part
of
the
Harrisburg
metropolitan

The

Hydrogeology
Boiling
Springs
is

According
to

Bureau
,
the
CDP
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
is
land
and
0.00
%
is
water
.

Boiling
Springs
gets
its
name
from
the
natural
artesian
well
springs
located
in
and
around
the
town
.

Boiling
Springs
ranks
seventh
in
size
of
springs
in
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
.

About
00
million
gallons
of
water
flows
per
day
from
a
total
of
00
springs
dotted
across
approximately
two
acres
.

The
impression
of
"
boiling
"
does
not
result
from
the
temperature
of
the
water
,
which
stays
at
00
degrees
Fahrenheit
(
00
degrees
Celsius
)
year-round
,
but
rather
from
a
unique
hydrogeological
feature
.

Two
vertical
diabase
dikes
,
made
up
of
highly
impermeable
igneous
basalt
parent
rock
,
cut
through
the
limestone
bedrock
in
the
area
and
form
a
subterranean
"
V
"
,
with
Boiling
Springs
located
at
the
interior
tip
of
the
V.
The
dikes
were
formed
around
000
million
years
ago
,
during
the
late
Triassic
and
early
Jurassic
periods
,
when
Pangea
broke
apart
:
the
same
period
of
geological
activity
that
formed
the
Palisades
Sill
.

What
is
now
eastern
North
America
began
to
separate
from
what
is
now
north-western
Africa
.

Deep
faults
formed
in
the
earth
’s
crust
as
the
continental
sections
pulled
apart
.

Magma
was
generated
through
decompression
melting
,
and
this
molten
rock
pushed
up
to
fill
the
faults
.

The
cooler
temperatures
of
the
upper
crust
quickly
solidified
the
hot
rock
,
preventing
it
from
reaching
the
surface
.

This
geological
process
created
large
,
thin
,
subvertical
sheets
of
impermeable
basalt
,
or
diabase
dikes
.

When
precipitation
flows
down
South
Mountain
,
a
large
amount
of
groundwater
is
produced
.

Much
of
the
water
,
which
has
an
acidic
pH
,
is
able
to
erode
the
valley
's
limestone
bedrock
and
continue
flowing
at
about
00
feet
below
the
soil
.

However
,
some
of
the
water
is
trapped
by
the
impermeable
diabase
dikes
,
which
act
as
a
hydrologic
barrier
.

The
water
becomes
progressively
confined
by
the
dikes
as
it
nears
the
tip
of
the
"
V
"
.

Due
to
the
positive
pressure
created
by
this
confinement
,
water
is
pushed
up
to
the
surface
and
out
of
the
artesian
aquifer
,
giving
the
impression
of
“
boiling
”
springs
.

The
springs
have
a
median
flow
of
00,000
gallons
per
minute
.

One
of
the
most
prominent
springs
in
this
area
is
called
the
"
Bubble
"
.

It
is
located
directly
behind
the
Boiling
Springs
Tavern
,
at
the
intersection
of
0st
St.
and
Front
St.
The
name
of
the
Boiling
Springs
High
School
mascot
,
"
The
Bubble
"
,
was
partially
inspired
by
this
spring
.

Children
's
Lake
This
seven-acre
body
of
water
was
formed
by
partially
damming
the
brook
fed
from
00
natural
springs
,
including
the
"
Bubble
.
"

Children
's
Lake
is
home
to
many
ducks
,
swans
,
and
geese
throughout
the
year
.

The
lake
dates
to
the
0000s
when
the
dam
was
used
to
provide
water
power
for
iron
production
.

In
the
mid-00th
century
,
a
grist
mill
was
built
by
Michael
Ege
on
the
southeast
shore
of
the
lake
,
to
provide
flour
and
grain
for
the
iron
works
.

This
building
has
been
converted
into
apartments
.

On
the
east
shore
,
remaining
from
the
pre-revolutionary
iron
forge
complex
,
are
the
original
forge
and
the
iron
master
's
mansion
with
the
remnants
of
its
terraced
gardens
.

This
0000
Georgian
structure
is
the
most
outstanding
example
of
architecture
in
the
Boiling
Springs
Historic
District
and
of
major
historical
significance
as
the
home
of
the
Ege
family
.

The
mansion
is
presently
in
a
deteriorating
condition
and
is
uninhabited
.

The
lake
feeds
into
the
Yellow
Breeches
Creek
.

A
picturesque
,
natural
stone
three
arch
bridge
,
built
in
0000
,
stands
behind
the
mill
,
spanning
the
Yellow
Breeches
Creek
.

This
limestone
trout
stream
has
developed
a
national
reputation
for
fly
fishing
.

Where
Children
's
Lake
runs
into
the
Yellow
Breeches
,
a
one-mile
stretch
of
water
known
as
"
The
Junction
"
provides
quality
catch-and-release
fishing
year
round
.

This
is
arguably
the
most
intensely
fished
section
of
water
in
Pennsylvania
when
the
White
Mayfly
hatches

Limestone

streams
are
rich
in
minerals

History
Boiling
Springs
was
settled
by
Europeans
prior
to
0000
.

The
springs
were
partially
dammed
in
the
0000s
to
provide
water
power
for
iron
production
,
with
raw
materials
of
iron
ore
,
timber
and
limestone
plentiful
in
the
neighboring
mountains
.

The
Carlisle
Iron
Works
was
in
full
production
by
the
0000s
,
and
a
grist
mill
was
built
at
the
end
of
the
lake
in
0000
.

While
the
foundry
's
iron
was
probably
used
to
make
ammunition
and
weapons
for
the
Continental
Army
,
no
cannons
were
made
.

Daniel
Kaufman
,
who
laid
out
the
village
of
Boiling
Springs
in
0000
,
purchased
00
acres
from
his
father
,
Abraham
,
in
0000
.

He
built
his
000
Front
Street
home
in
0000
.

Kaufman
and
Boiling
Springs
played
a
role
in
the
Underground
Railroad
.

Kaufman
was
an
Underground
Railroad
agent
from
0000
to
0000
.

The
Underground
Railroad
asked
him
to
set
up
a
necessary
stopover
between
Shippensburg
and
Harrisburg
.

Kaufman
provided
food
and
transportation
to
fugitive
slaves
passing
through
the
area
;
his
barn
and
a
densely
wooded
area
nearby
served
as
shelter
.

Kaufman
was
sued
by
a
Maryland
slave
owner
in
0000
and
convicted
in
Cumberland
County
[
0
]
,
but
the
verdict
was
overturned
by
the
state
Supreme
Court
.

He
was
then
charged
in
U.S.
District
Court
in
Philadelphia
and
convicted
.

He
was
ultimately
fined
$
0,000
in
0000
,
in
a
case
that
drew
wide
attention
.

Boiling
Springs
is
now
part
of
the
Network
to
Freedom
,
a
series
of
noteworthy
sites
along
the
Underground
Railroad
.

The
area
around
the
lake
was
a
recreation
spot
as
early
as
0000
when
a
steam
launch
began
to
operate
to
carry
picnickers
down
the
mill
race
to
Island
Grove
,
on
the
Yellow
Breeches
Creek
.

In
0000
,
trolley
car
lines
were
added
running
from
Carlisle
and
Harrisburg
.

The
Valley
Traction
Company
leased
the
lake
in
0000
and
built
a
park
as
a
destination
for
passengers
on
their
trolleys
.

Boiling
Springs
became
a
resort
community
,
with
travelers
coming
to
picnic
and
boat
on
the
lake
,
with
such
park
attractions
as
a
dance
pavilion
,
picnic
pavilion
,
miniature
steam
railway
and
a
merry-go-round
.

The
trolley
was
operated
until
around
0000
.

The
Boiling
Springs
Historic
District
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

idea
is
to
be
the

.

Geography
Like
the
northern
parts
of
Sweden
(
colloquial
Norrland
)
,
it
is
scarsely
populated
due
to
its
inhospitable
conditions
and
cold
climate
,
but
is
superb
for
those
who
like
wildlife
and
untouched
nature
.

:
Culture
Every
July
the
town
of
Vilhelmina
holds
a
festival
called
Hembygdsdagarna
Vilhelmina
.

In
addition
to
popular
and
folk
music
performances
,
tradition
holds
that
a
local
engaged
couple
is
selected
each
year
to
get
married
during
the
festival
.

The
bride
and
groom
lead
a
parade
of
fiddlers
and
other
traditionally
dressed
Swedes
through
town
to
the
church
where
the
marriage
is
performed
in
front
of
all
who
wish
to
attend
.

They
are
not
always
able
to
find
a
couple
willing
to
get
married
,
however
,
so
some
years
they
hold
the
parade
without
an
engaged
couple
,
and
hold
a
public
church
service
instead
of
a
wedding

Municipality
(
)
is
a
municipality
in
Västerbotten
County

,
not
amalgamated

But
in
preparation
for
the
reform
the
name
was
changed
in
0000
from
Degerfors
Municipality
to
Vindeln
Municipality
.

The
reason
was
that
there
is
another
Degerfors
Municipality
(
in
Örebro
County
)
,
and
every
municipality
in
Sweden
should
have
a
unique
name
.

Geography
The
Vindel
River
,
which
is
the
main
tributary
of
the
Ume
River
,
runs
through
the
municipality
and
has
given
it
its
name
.

History
Named
for
a
settlement
of
mechanics
who
made
and
repaired
Conestoga
wagon
s
in
the
early
00th
century
,
Mechanicsburg
's
continued
growth
was
also
attributed
to
the
Cumberland
Valley
Railroad
(
CVRR
)
.

Completing
its
line
in
0000
,
Mechanicsburg
was
designated
as
a
water
station
where
workers
could
restock
the
locomotive
's
wood
and
pump
water
.

The
train
became
the
town
's
link
to
the
world
of
business
and
industry
.

Grain
and
feed
companies
,
lumber
yards
and
numerous
factories
were
purposely
built
alongside
the
railroad
tracks
.

Archives
show
that
,
at
one
time
,
there
were
twenty-five
trains
chugging
through
the
town
daily
carrying
travelers
,
coal
,
feathers
,
fruit
,
ice
,
mail
and
newspapers
.

During
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
railroad
was
an
invaluable
method
of
transporting
troops
and
supplies
.

Today
,
approximately
six
trains
travel
through
Mechanicsburg
each
day
,
which
has
recently
increased
due
to
new
operations
on
the
local
sub-line
owned
by
Norfolk
Southern
.

Another
part
of
Mechanicsburg
's
growth
occurred
when
the
Naval
Support
Activity
was
built
on
of
land
in
Hampden
Township
,
Pennsylvania
.

NSA
Mechanicsburg
continues
to
serve
as
one
of
the
Defense
Departments
major
logistics
sites
.

Although
automotive
technology
changed
the
town
forever
,
today
's
residents
can
not
dismiss
the
vital
role
the
railroad
played
in
its
development
.

Present-day
Mechanicsburg
is
centered
on
that
Leonard
Fisher
purchased
from
Joseph
Heynes
tract
(
No.
0000
of
an
original
grant
of
from
William
Penn
)
.

Before
becoming
incorporated
on
April
00
,
0000
,
the
town
went
by
several
different
names
.

First
,
Drytown
,
because
of
the
extreme
scarcity
of
water
during
the
winter
and
summer
.

It
was
also
known
as
Pinchgut
,
a
German
name
used
as
a
sign
of
amusement
given
to
a
small
village
of
only
a
few
people
.

Some
also
referred
to
the
town
as
Staufferstown
,
in
honor
of
Henry
Stauffer
,
the
owner
of
much
of
the
land
in
the
center
of
town
.

Briefly
,
referred
to
as
Creekville
during
the
Colonial
Era
,
Mechanicsburg
is
home
to
many
historic
markers
,
such
as
Irving
Female
College
(
named
for
Washington
Irving
,
a
trustee
)
,
the
first
women
's
college
in
Pennsylvania
to
grant
degrees
in
arts
and
sciences
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
Confederate
troops
led
by
Brig.
Gen.
Albert
G.
Jenkins
raided
Mechanicsburg
,
and
two
days
later
,
met
with
Union
forces
in
the
Skirmish
of
Sporting
Hill
,
just
east
of
town
.

It
is
known
as
the
northern
most
engagement
of
the
Civil
War
.

Following
the
Skirmish
of
Sporting
Hill
,
the
Confederate
forces
retreated
south
into
the
little
town
of
Gettysburg
where
the
Battle
of
Gettysburg
would
be
fought
.

The
oldest
building
in
Mechanicsburg
is
the
Frankeberger
Tavern
.

One
of
Mechanicsburg
's
first
residents
was
George
Frankeberger
,
who
in
0000
applied
for
a
license
to
open
his
newly
built
log
home
for
the
"
convenience
"
of
travelers
.

In
exchange
for
a
small
fee
,
Mr.
Frankeberger
offered
cattle
drivers
a
warm
meal
and
a
place
to
sleep
.

This
proved
to
be
rather
lucrative
,
as
many
people
were
making
the
two
day
trek
between
Harrisburg
(
the
state
capital
)
and
Carlisle
(
Cumberland
County
's
county
seat
)
.

A
local
legend
tells
of
a
man
who
came
into
a
good
deal
of
money
having
just
sold
some
cattle
in
Harrisburg
.

After
boasting
about
it
in
front
of
many
of
the
other
travelers
in
the
tavern
,
he
retired
for
the
night
.

Another
man
,
having
heard
about
the
gold
he
was
carrying
,
followed
him
to
his
room
,
cut
off
his
head
,
and
stole
his
money
.

Legend
has
it
that
a
headless
ghost
can
sometimes
be
seen
sitting
atop
the
roof
of
Frankeberger
Tavern
,
looking
out
over
the
roofs
of
town
,
searching
for
the
man
who
stole
his
gold
.

The
Jerry
Springer
Show
is
a
syndicated
television
tabloid
talk
show
hosted
by
Jerry
Springer
,
a
former
politician
,
broadcast
in
the
United
States
and
other
countries
.

It
is
videotaped
at
the
Stamford
Media
Center
in
Stamford
,
Connecticut
and
is
distributed
by
NBC
Universal
Television
Distribution
,
although
it
is
not
currently
broadcast
on
any
NBC-owned
stations
.

Production
Format
A
typical
episode
of
Springer
begins
with
a
title
card
warning
parents
that
the
show
may
contain
content
inappropriate
for
children
.

Springer
then
enters
the
stage
by
sliding
down
a
stripper
pole
stage
right
,
usually
being
greeted
by
audience
applause
,
shaking
hands
with
random
guests
at
the
front
row
and
the
"
Je-rry
!

Once
the
audience
settles
down
,
he
welcomes
the
viewer
to
the
show
,
introduces
a
particular
situation
,
and
interviews
a
guest
who
is
experiencing
it
.

After
finishing
the
interview
,
Springer
announces
the
entrance
of
another
guest
whom
the
first
guest
would
like
to
confront
.

The
second
guest
enters
the
stage
,
and
a
confrontation
between
the
two
guests
usually
occurs
,
often
breaking
down
into
a
brawl
that
is
eventually
broken
up
by
on-set
security
personnel
.

Once
the
fight
is
broken
up
,
Springer
interviews
the
second
guest
about
the
situation
faced
by
the
first
guest
.

This
cycle
is
repeated
about
twice
for
other
sets
of
guests
on
the
show
.

Once
all
guests
have
told
their
stories
,
there
is
usually
a
"
question
and
answer
"
segment
where
audience
members
ask
guests
questions
relevant
to
their
situations
,
although
usually
their
questions
come
to
insult
a
guest
or
they
flash
the
audience
in
exchange
for
"
Jerry
Beads
"
(
Mardi
Gras
-
style
beads
with
the
show
logo
)
,
with
the
few
serious
questioners
mocked
by
the
audience
to
"
Go
to
Oprah
!
"
.

The
producers
then
select
the
person
with
the
most
memorable
question
to
say
,
"
We
'll
be
right
back
with
Jerry
's
final
thought
.
"

Springer
then
ends
the
show
by
giving
an
oratory
viewpoint
on
the
principles
of
refined
values
in
regards
to
the
featured
guests
.

He
ends
the
segment
with
the
concluding
statement
,
"
Till
next
time
,
take
care
of
yourself
and
each
other
"
.

Generally
,
Springer
tends
to
present
his
program
standing
up
pacing
the
aisle
steps
between
the
seating
areas
rather
than
having
a
podium
or
mark
on
the
main
stage
.

(
This
is
thought
to
be
to
protect
himself
from
the
potential
violence
occurring
on
the
stage
)
Sometimes
the
show
will
have
a
look
back
at
previous
episodes
.

These
have
been
rebranded
as
Classic
Springer
,
some
with
a
false
Masterpiece
Theatre
-
like
theme
and
patina
.

These
shows
are
interspersed
with
commentary
from
Springer
himself
,
usually
before
and
after
commercial
breaks
.

Set
The
set
for
the
show
has
had
two
major
changes
over
the
years
.

When
the
show
first
started
in
0000
,
it
was
very
basic
with
white
walls
,
in
an
effort
to
capture
the
feel
of
fellow
talk
show
Donahue
,
Jerry
's
haircut
and
glasses
even
seeming
to
make
him
look
like
Phil
Donahue
.

The
general
look
of
this
set
was
carried
over
when
the
series
first
moved
to
Chicago
in
September
0000
,
with
an
unpolished
,
open
air
look
and
bright
colored
shapes
.

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
a
few
months
after
the
series
underwent
its
format
overhaul
,
the
studio
received
a
makeover
to
make
it
look
a
bit
warmer
and
more
inviting
,
complete
with
brick
walls
,
artwork
,
and
bookcases
.

The
stage
walls
were
designed
so
that
they
could
be
projected
outward
into
the
audience
,
making
room
for
a
catwalk
that
was
used
in
shows
such
as
the
0000
episode
Stripper
Wars
!
.

In
late
0000
,
the
whole
set
was
changed
again
to
its
current
"
industrial
"
look
,
changes
initially
welcomed
due
to
the
reduced
ratings
of
the
0000-0000
season
.

In
0000
,
the
set
was
slightly
changed
,
with
a
larger
studio
audience
,
bigger
stage
,
and
a
balcony
,
which
was
above
the
stage
and
ended
at
the
pole
.

Springer
now
uses
this
as
his
main
entrance
by
sliding
down
the
pole
.

The
logo
and
stage
design
have
been
carried
across
to
the
new
studio
in
Connecticut
with
only
a
few
changes
.

Security
Steve
Wilkos
was
the
director
of
security
from
0000-0000
.

He
now
hosts
his
own
show
,
The
Steve
Wilkos
Show
.

As
of
Season
00
,
the
two
primary
security
guards
are
Pete
Kelly
and
Jason
Brandstetter
.

Pete
is
often
the
first
on
stage
and
handles
most
of
the
action
,
while
Jason
backs
him
up
.

After
the
move
to
Stamford
,
the
show
hired
two
local
firefighters
,
Harold
and
Chris
,
to
join
the
security
team
.

They
serve
as
the
front
row
audience
's
protection
from
the
on-stage
fights
and
also
are
assistants
to
Pete
and
Jason
if
things
get
out
of
hand
.

History
0000
The
Jerry
Springer
Show
debuted
on
September
00
,
0000
,
with
a
family
reunion
as
its
first
show
.

Initially
,
Springer
was
distributed
by
Multimedia
Entertainment
,
later
going
to
the
former
Universal
and
then
to
Studios
USA
.

Originally
seen
in
only
the
four
markets
where
Multimedia
owned
TV
stations
,
it
was
dramatically
different
than
today
's
version
of
the
show
.

It
started
as
an
issues-oriented
and
political
talk
show
,
a
longer
version
of
the
commentary
for
which
Springer
had
gained
local
fame
as
a
reporter
and
anchor
,
and
for
its
first
season
,
was
even
taped
at
Springer
's
former
station
,
WLWT
in
Cincinnati
.

Guests
early
on
included
Oliver
North
and
Jesse
Jackson
,
and
the
topics
included
homelessness
and
gun
politics
,
as
well
as
the
social
effects
of
rock
music
,
featuring
shock
rock
stars
like
GG
Allin
,
El
Duce
from
The
Mentors
and
GWAR
as
guests
.

0000-0000
For
its
second
season
in
the
fall
of
0000
,
the
series
was
purchased
by
the
NBC
owned-and-operated
station
s
,
thus
allowing
it
to
finally
achieve
full
national
clearance
,
and
production
was
moved
to
its
longtime
home
at
Chicago
's
NBC
Tower
(
with
Springer
leaving
his
longtime
position
at
WLWT
in
order
to
do
so
)
.

However
,
ratings
remained
low
and
by
April
0000
,
Multimedia
threatened
cancellation
if
ratings
did
n't
improve
by
that
November
,
which
led
to
an
overhaul
that
saw
original
producer
Burt
Dubrow
's
departure
and
replacement
by
fellow
Springer
producer
Richard
Dominick
.

The
search
for
higher
ratings
led
the
program
gradually
towards
provocative
topics
,
becoming
more
successful
as
it
became
geared
towards
youthful
viewers
(
modeled
after
Ricki
Lake
's
popular
talk
show
)
by
introducing
more
controversial
topics
.

However
,
there
were
still
some
traditional
and
serious
topics
featured
on
the
show
at
this
time
.

In
December
0000
,
the
show
started
featuring
such
topics
as
"
My
boyfriend
turned
out
to
be
a
girl
"
and
"
I
want
my
man
to
stop
watching
porn
!
"

,
as
well
as
investigating
which
are
sexier
:
bigger
or
smaller
breasts
on
women
.

In
0000
,
there
were
two
performances
by
Comedy
Central
transgender
star
Jade
Esteban
Estrada
.

It
became
a
"
freak
show
"
where
guests
seek
their
00
minutes
of
fame
through
discussion
and
demonstrations
of
deviant
behavior
.

In
0000
,
Springer
wanted
people
to
send
him
videotapes
explaining
why
they
wanted
Springer
to
tape
a
show
in
their
home
.

Its
extraordinary
success
has
led
it
to
be
broadcast
in
dozens
of
countries
.

The
show
gained
so
much
popularity
that
for
a
while
it
was
the
top-rated
daytime
talk
show
in
the
United
States
.

In
0000
,
several
stations
that
carried
Springer
,
including
WLWT
in
Cincinnati
where
Springer
was
a
news
anchor
,
refused
to
carry
the
episode
"
I
Married
A
Horse
"
.

In
0000
,
the
show
made
a
cameo
appearance
in
the
film
Austin
Powers
:
The
Spy
Who
Shagged
Me
,
with
Dr.
Evil
and
his
son
Scott
discussing
about
being
evil
.

Early
0000s
In
0000
,
Springer
was
given
a
five-year
,
$
00
million
contract
extension
paying
him
$
0
million
per
year
.

The
same
year
,
a
married
couple
,
Ralf
and
Eleanor
Panitz
,
were
guests
on
an
episode
of
the
show
entitled
"
Secret
Mistresses
Confronted
"
with
Mr.
Panitz
's
ex-wife
,
Nancy
Campbell-Panitz
,
in
which
they
complained
about
Ms.
Campbell-Panitz
's
behavior
and
accused
her
of
stalking
them
.

Hours
after
it
was
broadcast
on
July
00
,
0000
,
Ms.
Campbell-Panitz
was
found
dead
in
a
home
that
the
three
were
fighting
over
,
and
Florida
police
soon
confirmed
that
they
were
treating
the
death
as
homicide
.

It
was
then
reported
that
Mr.
Panitz
,
having
been
issued
a
first-degree
murder
warrant
for
the
death
,
was
trying
to
flee
to
Canada
to
avoid
prosecution
.

Upon
news
of
the
00-year
old
woman
's
murder
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
program
issued
a
statement
saying
it
was
"
a
terrible
tragedy
.
"

In
August
0000
,
Springer
appeared
on
CNN
's
Larry
King
Live
to
discuss
the
incident
,
claiming
that
it
"
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
show
"
and
that
his
talk
show
does
not
glamorize
deviant
behavior
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
after
a
00-day
trial
and
00
hours
of
deliberating
from
jurors
,
Mr.
Panitz
was
convicted
of
the
murder
and
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
.

In
0000
,
efforts
from
groups
like
the
Parents
Television
Council
and
American
Family
Association
made
some
advertisers
decrease
or
stop
their
sponsorship
of
Springer
.

For
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
Independent
Television
Commission
banned
Springer
and
other
tabloid
talk
programs
from
being
shown
on
television
during
daytime
hours
on
school
holidays
in
response
to
numerous
parental
complaints
and
concerns
about
children
's
potential
exposure
to
the
salacious
content
(
there
was
a
short-running
British
version
of
the
show
made
for
ITV
called
The
Springer
Show
that
was
lighter
and
more
tongue-in-cheek
)
.

The
show
also
topped
TV
Guide
magazine
's
0000
list
of
"
The
Worst
TV
Shows
Ever
"
.

The
phrase
"
Jerry
Springer
Nation
"
began
to
be
used
by
some
who
see
the
program
as
being
a
bad
influence
on
the
morality
of
the
United
States
.

In
addition
,
the
phrase
has
shown
the
association
of
Springer
with
any
"
lowbrow
"
type
of
entertainment
in
general
.

In
0000
,
a
British
opera
inspired
by
the
series
,
Jerry
Springer
:
The
Opera
,
began
playing
in
the
United
Kingdom
.

The
same
year
,
it
was
revealed
that
a
group
of
guests
from
Hayward
,
California
faked
a
"
love
triangle
"
for
an
appearance
on
two
episodes
of
the
show
;
one
guest
in
the
group
was
murdered
,
but
Hayward
police
determined
that
his
appearance
was
not
connected
to
his
murder
.

By
0000
,
security
director
Steve
Wilkos
became
sort
of
a
cult
figure
on
his
own
,
and
would
close
each
show
walking
down
a
hallway
engaging
in
casual
talk
with
one
of
the
more
colorful
guests
of
the
preceding
episode
.

He
also
would
occasionally
host
the
show
.

Episodes
that
he
hosted
were
intended
to
be
more
serious
in
tone
than
the
typical
Springer
show
.

Wilkos
left
Springer
at
the
end
of
the
0000-00
season
to
pursue
his
own
self-titled
talk
show
,
The
Steve
Wilkos
Show
.

Mid-0000s
to
present
In
0000
,
the
program
became
a
subject
of
criticism
in
Bernard
Goldberg
's
book
000
People
Who
Are
Screwing
Up
America
,
being
called
"
TV
's
lowest
life-form
"
and
Springer
himself
being
ranked
at
00
and
labeled
an
"
American
Pioneer
"
.

Goldberg
also
claimed
that
Springer
was
knowingly
capitalizing
on
the
disadvantages
of
his
guests
and
the
stupidity
of
his
audience
,
also
citing
the
controversial
episode
revolving
around
the
man
who
married
his
horse
.

In
January
0000
,
the
show
was
renewed
for
its
sixteenth
season
,
ending
speculation
that
Springer
would
leave
his
talk
show
to
run
for
elected
office
in
Ohio
,
where
he
is
the
former
mayor
of
Cincinnati
.

By
this
time
,
the
show
began
to
poke
fun
at
itself
by
using
the
taglines
"
An
Hour
of
Your
Life
You
'll
Never
Get
Back
"
and
"
Wasting
Technology
Since
0000
.
"

On
May
00
,
0000
,
Springer
celebrated
his
show
's
0,000
th
episode
by
throwing
a
party
on
the
show
(
which
no
one
but
Jerry
showed
up
to
humorously
)
,
and
showed
many
clips
,
including
rare
excerpts
from
the
first
season
.

In
the
United
Kingdom
,
meanwhile
,
a
Commercial
High
Court
trial
was
scheduled
for
summer
0000
to
resolve
a
dispute
between
Flextech
Television
and
NBC
Universal
over
Flextech
in
0000
cancelling
its
0000
contract
to
broadcast
Springer
in
the
UK
as
long
as
new
episodes
continued
to
be
produced
in
the
U.S.
.

In
0000
,
security
director
Wilkos
left
Jerry
Springer
to
host
his
own
syndicated
talk
show
.

The
Steve
Wilkos
Show
was
also
shot
at
the
NBC
Tower
in
Chicago
and
produced
by
Richard
Dominick
,
who
continued
to
produce
Springer
as
well
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
it
was
announced
that
Springer
was
picked
up
by
NBC-Universal
through
the
0000-0000
season
.

Also
,
VH0
ran
a
documentary
series
The
Springer
Hustle
,
going
"
behind
the
scenes
"
of
the
show
,
having
already
run
another
Springer-related
documentary
in
0000
titled
When
Jerry
Springer
Ruled
the
World
.

Springer
's
appearance
on
the
NBC
television
network
show
America
's
Got
Talent
led
to
an
increase
in
viewership
for
the
first
quarter
of
0000
.

Steve
Wilkos
filled
in
for
Springer
during
the
beginning
of
America
's
Got
Talent
.

The
security
staff
for
the
program
also
was
given
new
additions
,
as
starting
in
the
seventeenth
season
,
three
female
security
guards
were
added
.

Certain
professional
athletes
have
come
on
the
show
as
one-off
security
guards
for
some
episodes
.

They
include
hockey
players
Joe
Corvo
and
Adam
Burish
,
and
mixed
martial
arts
fighters
Andrei
Arlovski
,
Shonie
Carter
,
and
Bas
Rutten
.

Certain
advertisers
continue
to
avoid
buying
ad
time
for
Springer
.

However
,
the
show
has
continued
to
keep
steady
ratings
in
the
February
0000
"
Sweeps
"
period
.

Executive
producer
Richard
Dominick
resigned
shortly
after
the
start
of
the
00th
season
;
Rachelle
Consiglio
,
wife
of
Steve
Wilkos
and
longtime
Senior
Producer
,
replaced
Dominick
.

The
set
decorations
added
during
the
00th
season

,
where

since
0000
,
midway

Beginning
with
the
0000-00
season
,
production
was
moved
to
the
Stamford
Media
Center
in
Stamford
,
Connecticut
.

Jerry
was
quoted
as
saying
he
was
not
happy
with
the
move
,
but
understood
the
financial
reasons
for
which
it
was
being
done
,
and
is
working
to
secure
jobs
for
those
on
his
staff
who
wish
to
move
with
the
show
.

Since
taping
at
Stamford
Media
Center
,
the
show
has
received
a
number
of
changes
;
the

has
been
become
more
highly
colored
with
new
lighting
,
new
chairs
for
guests
,
two
new
security
guards
,
and
a
change
to
its
iconic
theme
music
.

The
show
aired
its
00th
anniversary
episode
,
which
was
taped
in
Times
Square
in
New
York
,
on
October

,

.

Springers
twenty-first

premiered
September

,
0000
,
debuting
new
graphics
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
The
Jerry
Springer
Show
began
airing
in
widescreen
,
in
conjunction
with
its
00nd
season
premiere
.

It
is
still
broadcasting

standard

.

Controversies
over
authenticity
and
violence
In
the
late
0000s
,
the
show
was
quite
popular
and
controversial
,
so
much
so
that
it
caused
contemporaries
like
Jenny
Jones
,
Maury
Povich
,
and
Ricki
Lake
to
"
revamp
"
their
own
shows
in
order
to
improve
ratings
.

However
,
major
figures
in
television
,
along
with
many
religious
leaders
,
had
called
for
the
show
's
removal
and
considered
it
to
be
of
bad
taste
.

In
0000
and
0000
,
the
show
reached
its
ratings
peak
,
at
one
point
becoming
the
first
talk
show
in
years
to
beat
The
Oprah
Winfrey
Show
.

It
featured
almost
non-stop
fighting
between
guests
—
0
to
00
per
day
during
one
April
0000
week
—
and
other
TV
personalities
and
priests
complained
.

Chicago
City
Council
suggested
that
if
the
fistfights
and
chair-throwing
were
real
,
then
the
guests
should
be
arrested
for
committing
acts
of
violence
in
the
city
,
as
alderman
Ed
Burke
was
concerned
over
the
fact
that
the
off-duty
Chicago
police
officers
serving
as
security
guards
for
the
program
failed
to
take
legal
action
against
fighting
guests
.

Springer
explained
that
the
violence
on
the
program
"
look
[
ed
]
real
"
to
him
,
also
arguing
that
the
fighting
on
the
show
"
never
,
ever
,
ever
glamorizes
violence
"
.

Ultimately
,
the
City
Council
chose
not
to
pursue
the
matter
.

Because
of
this
probe
and
other
external
and
internal
pressures
,
the
fighting
was
taken
off
the
show
temporarily
before
being
allowed
again
in
a
less
violent
nature
.

In
the
years
of
the
show
having
toned
down
the
fights
,
viewership
has
declined
but
remains
respectable
by
newer
standards
of
daytime
television
ratings
.

There
has
been
continuous
debate
over
the
authenticity
of
the
fighting
.

In
an
interview
,
a
production
assistant
stated
that
"
we
try
our
hardest
to
screen
people
,
"
and
inauthentic-seeming
guests
have
been
kicked
off
stage
.

Marvin
Kitman
,
television
critic
for
the
Newsday
newspaper
,
felt
that
the
fighting
had
been
choreographed
beforehand
.

Christopher
Sterling
of
the
George
Washington
University
media
department
compared
the
program
to
professional
wrestling
;
in
fact
many
of
the
producers
later
on
admitted
the
fights
in
the
show
were
inspired
by
the
fights
and
angles
in
the
WWF
.

Sixteen
former
guests
of
The
Jerry
Springer
Show
,
who
were
interviewed
on
various
U.S.
media
outlets
such
as
the
entertainment
news
program
Extra
,
Rolling
Stone
magazine
,
and
The
New
York
Post
newspaper
,
even
claimed
there
was
a
"
fight
quota
"
for
each
episode
and
that
they
and
other
guests
were
encouraged
to
fight
one
another
.

In
the
past
,
producers
have
even
booked
professional
wrestlers
such
as
The
Iron
Sheik
,
Jamie
Dundee
,
0
Tuff
Tony
,
Madman
Pondo
,
and
One
Man
Kru
(
also
a
hip
hop
artist
)
,
as
well
as
lady
wrestlers
and
midget
wrestlers
.

Springer
himself
even
admitted
in
an
October
0000
interview
with
the
Reuters
news
agency
:
Censorship
Springer
airs
on
various
stations
in
the
United
States
at
various
times
of
the
day
,
whether
in
the
morning
,
afternoon
,
or
in
the
late
night
hours
.

All
syndicated
episodes
of
Springer
are
censored
,
regardless
of
time
,
to
comply
with
U.S.
Federal
Communications
Commission
(
FCC
)
regulations
regarding
the
broadcast
of
indecency
and
obscenity
.

Initially
,
mainly
profanity
was
bleeped
,
but
later
episodes
were
bleeped
for
explicit
language
,
sometimes
to
such
an
extent
that
speech
became
incomprehensible
.

In
addition
,
nudity
and
the
partial
exposure
of
breast
s
or
buttocks
are
pixelated
.

After
longtime
producer
Richard
Dominick
left
,
the
show
reverted
to
the
traditional
style
of
bleeping
,
which
remains
in
place
today
.

In
one
week
in
April
0000
,
The
New
York
Times
found
that
each
episode
had
about
00
to
000
bleeps
.

Springer
himself
has
stated
that
,
while
his
show
is
a
bit
wild
,
there
are
certain
things
that
are
not
permitted
.

The
audience
is
not
allowed
to
shout
anything
that
encourages
or
sustains
violence
among
the
guests
.

Furniture
may
be
pushed
aside
,
but
the
chairs
are
purposely
large
to
preclude
their
use
as
a
weapon
.

Men
being
violent
against
women
is
never
acceptable
,
on
-
or
off-camera
;
in
Ringmaster
,
Springer
mentions
that
he
always
asks
if
the
woman
wants
to
press
charges
.

Too
Hot
for
TV
During
the
show
's
most
popular
era
in
the
late
0000s
,
The
Jerry
Springer
Show
released
videotapes
and
later
DVD
s
marketed
as
Too
Hot
for
TV
.

They
contained
uncensored
nudity
,
profanity
,
and
violence
that
was
edited
out
from
broadcast
to
conform
to
FCC
standards
for
broadcast
decency
.

The
releases
sold
remarkably
well
and
inspired
similar
sets
from
other
series
.

Eventually
,
the
show
started
producing
similar
"
uncensored
"
monthly
pay-per-view
/
video
on
demand
specials
as
well
.

Irie
Collins

Surahammar
Municipality
(
Surahammars
kommun
)
is
a
municipality
in
Västmanland
County
in
central
Sweden
.

Its
seat
is
located
in
the
town
of
Surahammar
.

The
municipality
is
located
some
000
km
west
of
Stockholm
in
the
southern
part
of
the
mineral-rich
Bergslagen
region
.

The
municipality
was
formed
in
0000
through
the
amalgamation
of
Ramnäs
and
Sura
.

Localities
History
Steelmaking
in
this
municipality
was
started
in
larger
scale
in
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
when
forge
s
were
built
here
.

Is
was
a
new
phenomena
to
run
forge
mills
separate
from
mining
and
pig
iron
production
sites
in
Bergslagen
.

The
mills
were
located
in
Virsbo
,
Ramnäs
and
Surahammar
and
Pig
iron
was
transported
from
mills
further
north
,
initially
by
horse-sledges
in
the
winter
.

There
was
ample
local
supply
of
hydropower
to
run
the
forge
hammers
and
timber
to
make
charcoal
.

Later
,
when
Strömsholm
Canal
was
finished
,
it
was
used
to
ship
finished
products
to
Västerås
and
Stockholm
for
export
.

This
restructuring
process
appears
to
have
been
driven
by
the
need
to
secure
access
to
hydropower
and
timber
for
the
forges
since
both
the
mines
and
blast
furnaces
used
up
considerable
amounts
of
resources
in
the
production
of
pig
iron
.

Over
time
the
mills
specialised
and
in
Ramnäs
the
key
product
became
iron
chains
-
in
modern
days
for
the
off-shore
industry
-
and
in
Surahammar
wheel-sets
for
the
rail
road
industry
and
electro
steels
,
both
with
ASEA
as
a
major
customer
.

In
Surahammar
,
Gustaf
Eriksson
developed
the
first
combustion-engine
automobile
built
i
Sweden
in
0000
.

It
formed
the
basis
for
a
new
Swedish
industry
that
was
located
in
Södertälje
under
the
name
of
Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget
i
Södertelge
(
renamed
in
0000
to
Vabis
that
later
merged
with
Scania
AB
)
.

Today
,
the
mills
in
Virsbo
,
Ramnäs
and
Surahammar
have
been
transformed
into
modern
industries
with
international
owners
.

History
Dauphin
borough
began
as
a
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
Stony
Creek
,
the
head
of
a
valley
between
Second
and
Third
Mountains
.

It
was
established
by
Samuel
Sturgeon
in
0000
.

By
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
the
Sturgeon
property
was
owned
by
Revolutionary
War
soldier
,
Colonel
Timothy
Green
.

The
locality
became
known
as
Green
's
Mill
,
after
the
grist
mill
Colonel
Green
built
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
.

According
to
local
history
,
the
area
was
also
known
for
its
colonial-period
fort
,
alternately
called
Fort
Lyon
or
Fort
McKee
.

Colonel
Green
continued
to
hold
highly-valued
real
estate
until
his
death
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
his
plantation
property
with
its
mills
became
part
of
his
son
Judge
Innis
Green
's
holdings
.

Judge
Green
continued
to
add
to
his
real
estate
holdings
throughout
the
early
nineteenth
century
.

The
surrounding
township
is
called
Middle
Paxton
,
part
of
the
former
Paxton
Township
of
Lancaster
County
prior
to
the
creation
of
Dauphin
County
in
0000
.

Middle
Paxton
Township
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

The
main
feature
of
geography
of
this
area
are
ancient
hills
or
mountains
and
narrow
valleys
that
generally
run
east
to
west
with
streams
emptying
into
the
Susquehanna
River
.

The
township
remained
rural
until
the
twentieth
century
.

Judge
Green
laid
out
Dauphin
as
Port
Lyon
in
recognition
of
the
former
Fort
in
0000
.

Green
named
the
Port
Lyon
streets
after
Pennsylvania
rivers
and
creeks
.

Opportunities
for
economic
expansion
for
the
area
appeared
bright
that
year
,
as
legislation
was
passed
for
creation
of
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
.

This
fostered
expectations
that
Dauphin
would
become
a
port
to
the
coalfield
s
lying
to
the
northeast
.

Green
acted
on
behalf
of
the
Dauphin
&
Susquehanna
(
D
&
S
)
Coal
Company
,
which
had
purchased
eighteen
tracts
of
land
on
or
near
Little
Mountain
,
totaling
about
,
from
a
group
of
businessmen
.

Charles
Bird
had
earlier
that
year
purchased
four
tracts
of
land
in
Middle
Paxton
Township
from
Judge
Green
.

Bird
's
interest
was
purchased
by
a
group
of
businessmen
who
then
sold
to
the
D
&
S
Coal
Company
.

Green
received
the
last
payment
on
the
agreement
price
of
US
$
00,000.00
in
0000
.

Dauphin
was
incorporated
into
a
borough
by
an
act
of
Assembly
in
0000
.

According
to
the
0000
census
,
Dauphin
had
000
inhabitants
at
that
time
.

There
were
000
families
in
000
dwellings
.

The
0000
census
for
the
borough
illustrated
the
working-class
nature
of
the
people
living
there
.

The
borough
had
000
inhabitants
in
000
households
,
nearly
the
same
as
recorded
in
0000
.

Fifty-five
of
the
men
listed
their
occupation
as
"
day
laborer
.
"

The
0000
census
showed
a
marked
change
in
the
occupation
of
Dauphin
's
residents
.

Jobs
related
to
the
canal
had
dropped
dramatically
,
while
those
associated
with
the
railroads
had
increased
substantially
.

At
this
time
there
were
000
households
living
in
000
dwellings
.

The
borough
's
population
had
increased
to
000
.

By
0000
,
the
borough
contained
four
churches
,
three
schools
and
one
select
school
,
and
two
lodges
.

The
0000
census
showed
000
families
living
in
000
dwellings
in
Dauphin
,
but
by
now
they
occupied
000
dwellings
.

In
the
early
twentieth
century
,
several
"
summer
"
houses
were
constructed
on
the
edge
of
Third
Mountain
,
south
of
Stony
Creek
.

Middle-class
residents
of
Harrisburg
City
built
these
houses
as
second
homes
to
supplement
their
primary
townhouse
s.
These
houses
are
collectively
called
"
Hillside
"
and
have
since
become
year-round
homes
.

The
borough
has
always
been
associated
with
transportation
,
situated
along
the
Susquehanna
River
.

Original
Native
American
trails
would
have
followed
waterways
such
as
the
river
and
Stony
Creek
.

Development
of
the
canal
system
of
transporting
goods
during
the
early
nineteenth
century
gave
way
to
the
rise
of
the
railroads
,
which
lasted
for
much
of
the
twentieth
.

U.S.
Route
00
became
a
major
highway
through
Pennsylvania
during
the
mid-twentieth
century
,
parts
of
which
were
actually
constructed
within
the
footprint
of
the
former
Pennsylvania
Canal
.

Dauphin
thus
developed
as
an
early
transportation
hub
,
but
in
more
recent
decades
had
been
bypassed
by
more
significant
routes
of
transport
,
such
as
the
Eisenhower
Interstate
Highway
System
.

In
the
last
forty
or
so
years
,
Dauphin
Borough
has
been
a
bedroom
community
of
Harrisburg
,
the
Pennsylvania
state
capital
.

Many
of
its
civic
centers
had
gone
into
steep
decline
,
industry
migrated
elsewhere
,
taverns
and
hotels
closed
,
as
did
schools
and
churches
.

The
railroad
,
which
declined
during
the
late
twentieth
century
,
has
been
reduced
to
two
tracks
paralleling
the
river
,
with
no
stops
or
stations
in
Dauphin
.

One
of
the
reasons
for
the
decline
was
that
as
traffic
on
U.S.
Rte
.

00
increased
,
the
borough
became
less
desirable
as
a
place
in
which
to
reside
.

By
the
0000s
,
traffic
on
Rte
.

00
was
so
heavy
that
the
road
essentially
cut
the
Borough
in
half
.

Residents
often
had
such
a
difficult
time
traveling
across
the
borough
that
they
waited
until
after
morning
and
evening
rush
hours
.

On
weekends
when
the
Pennsylvania
State
University
in
State
College
,
some
ninety
miles
upstate
,
held
football
games
,
Rte
.

00
through
the
borough
was
impassable
.

In
older
times
,
Dauphin
was
the
hub
of
a
collection
of
small
village
centers
in
Middle
Paxton
Township
of
Dauphin
County
.

Some
of
these
settlements
included
:
Singersville
,
nearby
the
borough
;
Ellendale
Forge
,
two
miles
up
Stony
Creek
Valley
;
Dauphin
Furnace
,
at
the
mouth
of
Clark
Creek
;
Speeceville
,
at
the
foot
of
Peter
's
Mountain
;
and
Heckton
Mills
,
about
a
mile
downriver
from
Dauphin
.

Much
of
the
eastern
part
of
the
township
,
between
Peters
Mountain
and
Second
Mountain

preserved

State
Game
Lands
.

Most
of
these
village
centers
have
ceased
to
exist
as
the
western
part
of
Middle
Paxton
Township
became
suburbanized
.

The
nearest
organized
towns
to
Dauphin
are
Duncannon
,
a
borough
on
the
western
shore
of
the
river
;
Halifax
,
a
borough
north
of
Peters
Mountain
;
and
Harrisburg
,
the
state
capital
to
the
south
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
following
many
years
of
planning
and
several
postponements
,
Dauphin
Borough
was
bypassed
.

A
construction
project
that
had
caused
much
controversy
resulted
in
relocating
U.S.
Rte

00
closer
to
the
river
and
out
of
,
or
over
,
Dauphin
Borough
.

Approximately
00
%
of
the
borough
's
taxable
real
estate
was
destroyed
in
order
to
construct
the
bypass
.

The
remaining
town
,
free
of
the
traffic
problems
,
became
once
again
desirable
as
a
location
for
commuters
to
Harrisburg
.

Some
of
the
last
remaining
open
land
in
the
borough
was
developed
as
residential
space
,
and
older
structures
in
the
borough
were
increasingly
bought
and
renovated
by
commuters
.

Despite
the
losses
in
tax
revenues
owing
to
construction
of
the
bypass
,
the
local
government
continues
to
operate
through
cost-saving
,
cooperative
efforts
with
Middle
Paxton
Township
.

Sewer
system
connections
were
extended
to
borough
residents
in
Hillside
and
along
River
Road
as
part
of
a
collection
system
and
pump
station
upgrqade
.

In
0000
,
the
Dauphin/Middle
Paxton
Fire
Company
relocated
its
apparatus
from
the
borough
to
a
new
government
building
housing
Middle
Paxton
Township
offices
and
Public
Safety
.

The
local
ambulance
association
became
dormant
,
and
Susquehanna
Township
E.M.S.
began
covering
medical
emergencies
in
both
borough
and
township
.
