Infrastructure
In
0000
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
mandated
that
the
township
eliminate
sewer
overflows
in
the
Paxton
Creek
Basin
by
0000
.

Overflows
happen
when
extra
water
goes
out
manholes
during
heavy
storms
.

The
project
involves
the
replacement
of
of
asbestos
cement
pipes
in
the
Paxton
Creek
basin
,
which
drains
the
western
half
of
the
township
.

The
$
00
million
plan
will
be
paid
for
by
residents
'
sewer
bills
which
will
double
over
the
next
00
years
.

Ongoing
pollution
and
soil
erosion
in
the
region
continue
to
degrade
the
water
quality

locally
as
well
as
regionally
.

Farming
,
wastewater
treatment
facilities
and
industrial
spills
are
cited
as
contributing
factors
to
loss
of
water
quality
.

It
also
contributes
to
the
pollution
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
.

Controlling
the
wastewater
discharges
alone
is
expected
to
cost
local
taxpayers
along
the
Susquehanna
River
billions
of
dollars
.

Plans
for
a
greenways
project
are
moving
forward
.

Part
of
the
comprehensive
plan
developed
in

,
the
greenway
will
connect
via
trails
several
neighborhoods
to
five
schools
,
two
parks
and
the
Lower
Paxton
Township
Municipal
Building
.

The
cost
of
the
multiyear
project
is
estimated
at
$
00
million
.

In
0000
,
the
Foundation
for
Enhancing
Communities
conducted
an
extensive
study
.

They
identified
five
critical
lissues
for
Dauphin
County
which
include
access
to
health
care
,
transportation
to
jobs
,
substance
abuse
,
job
training/workforce
development
and
affordable

.

Environment
Local
waterways
have
been
significantly
impacted
by
development
.

The
Paxton
Creek
watershed
,
which
drains
much
of
the
area
surrounding
Harrisburg
,
has
experienced
substantial
change
in
land
uses
during
the
past
several
decades
.

Development
is
encroaching
on
some
of
Paxton
Creek
’s
headwaters
.

This
has
affected
water
levels
and
flow
patterns
,
and
caused
significant
erosion
,
sedimentation
,
and
flooding
.

This
watershed
now
produces
over
twice
the
nutrients
and
00
times
the
yields
of
suspended
sediments
that
are
released
by
typical
forested
basins
,
according

,
Cambridge
,
but
no
information
survives
as
to
the
duration
of
his
residence
.

Either
before
or
after
this
he
became
apprentice
to
his
uncle
Sir
John
Gresham
,
also
a
merchant
,
who
founded
Gresham
's
School
in
Holt
,
Norfolk
in
0000
:
his
own
testimony
states
that
he
served
an
apprenticeship
of
eight
years
.

Agent
in
the
Low
Countries
In
0000
the
Mercers
Company
admitted
the
00-year-old
Gresham
as
a
liveryman
,
and
in
the
same
year
he
went
to
the
Low
Countries
,
where
,
either
on
his
own
account
or
on
that
of
his
father
or
uncle
,
he
both
carried
on
business
as
a
merchant
and
acted
in
various
matters
as
an
agent
for
King
Henry
VIII
.

In
0000
he
married
Anne
Ferneley
,
the
widow
of
William
Read
,
a
London
merchant
,
but
he
still
continued
to
reside
principally
in
the
Low
Countries
,
having
his
headquarters
at
Antwerp
in
present-day
Belgium
,
where
he
played
the
market
skillfully
.

Financial
wizard
Rescuing
the
pound
When
in
0000
the
mismanagement
of
Sir
William
Dansell
,
king
's
merchant
in
the
Low
Countries
,
had
brought
the
English
government
into
great
financial
embarrassment
,
the
authorities
called
in
Gresham
to
give
his
advice
,
and
then
chose
him
to
carry
out
his
own
proposals
.

He
called
for
the
adoption
of
various
methods
—
highly
ingenious
,
but
quite
arbitrary
and
unfair
—
for
raising
the
value
of
the
pound
sterling
on
the
bourse
of
Antwerp
,
and
this
proved
so
successful
that
in
a
few
years
King
Edward
VI
discharged
almost
all
of
his
debts
.

The
government
sought
Gresham
's
advice
in
all
their
money
difficulties
,
and
also
frequently
employed
him
in
various
diplomatic
missions
.

He
had
no
stated
salary
,
but
in
reward
of
his
services
received
from
King
Edward
various
grants
of
lands
,
the
annual
value
of
which
at
that
time
amounted
ultimately
to
about
000
pounds
a
year
.

Later
services
to
the
crown
On
the
accession
of
Queen
Mary
in
0000
Gresham
went
out
of
favour
for
a
short
time
and
Alderman
William
Dauntsey
displaced
him
in
his
post
.

But
Dauntsey
's
financial
operations
proved
unsuccessful
and
Gresham
was
soon
re-instated
;
and
as
he
professed
his
zealous
desire
to
serve
the
Queen
,
and
manifested
great
adroitness
both
in
negotiating
loans
and
in
smuggling
money
,
arms
and
foreign
goods
,
not
only
were
his
services
retained
throughout
her
reign
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
but
besides
his
salary
of
twenty
shillings
per
diem
he
received
grants
of
church
lands
to
the
yearly
value
of
000
pounds
.

Under
Queen
Elizabeth
(
reigned
0000
–
0000
)
,
besides
continuing
in
his
post
as
financial
agent
of
the
crown
,
Gresham
acted
temporarily
as
ambassador
at
the
court
of
Margaret
of
Parma
,
receiving
a
knighthood
in
0000
prior
to
his
departure
.

The
unsettled
times
preceding
the
Dutch
Revolt
compelled
him
to
leave
Antwerp
on
00
March
0000
;
but
,
though
he
spent
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
London
,
he
continued
his
business
as
merchant
and
financial
agent
of
the
government
in
much
the
same
way
as
formerly
.

Overall
he
made
himself
one
of
the
richest
men
in
England
.

Queen
Elizabeth
also
found
Gresham
useful
in
a
great
variety
of
other
ways
,
including
acting
as
jailer
to
Lady
Mary
Grey
(
sister
of
Lady
Jane
Grey
)
,
who
,
as
a
punishment
for
marrying
Thomas
Keyes
the
sergeant
porter
,
remained
a
prisoner
in
his
house
from
June
0000
to
the
end
of
0000
.

Foundation
of
the
Royal
Exchange
In
0000
Gresham
made
a
proposal
to
the
court
of
aldermen
of
London
to
build
at
his
own
expense
a
bourse
or
exchange
—
what
became
the
Royal
Exchange
,
modeled
on
the
Antwerp
bourse
—
on
condition
that
they
purchased
for
this
purpose
a
piece
of
suitable
ground
.

In
this
proposal
he
seems
to
have
had
an
eye
to
his
own
interest
as
well
as
to
the
general
good
of
the
merchants
,
for
by
a
yearly
rental
of
£
000
obtained
for
the
shops
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
he
received
a
sufficient
return
for
his
trouble
and
expense
.

The
foundation
of
the
Royal
Exchange
is
the
background
of
Thomas
Heywood
's
play
:
If
You
Know
Not
Me
,
You
Know
Nobody
part
0
,
in
which
a
Lord
extols
the
quality
of
the
building
when
asked
if
he
has
ever
seen
"
a
goodlier
frame
"
:
"
Not
in
my
life
;
yet
I
have
been
in
Venice
,
In
the
Rialto
there
,
called
Saint
Mark
's
;
'
Tis
but
a
bauble
,
if
compared
to
this
.

The
nearest
,
that
which
most
resembles
this
,
Is
the
great
Burse
in
Antwerp
,
yet
no
comparable
Either
in
height
or
wildeness
,
the
fair
cellarage
,
Or
goodly
shops
above
.

Oh
my
Lord
Mayor
,
This
Gresham
hath
much
graced
your
City
of
London
;
His
fame
will
long
outlive
him
.

Death
Gresham
died
suddenly
,
apparently
of
apoplexy
,
on
00
November
0000
.

His
only
son
predeceased
him
,
and
his
illegitimate
daughter
Anne
,
whom
he
married
to
Sir
Nathaniel
Bacon
(
0000
?

–
0000
)
,
local
politician
,
half-brother
of
Francis
Bacon
,
0st
Viscount
St
Alban
.

He
is
buried
in
St
Helen
's
Bishopsgate
in
the
City
of
London
.

Bequest
for
the
foundation
of
Gresham
College
Apart
from
some
small
sums
to
various
charities
,
Gresham
bequeathed
the
bulk
of
his
property
(
consisting
of
estates
in
London
and
around
England
giving
an
income
of
more
than
0,000
pounds
a
year
)
to
his
widow
and
her
heirs
,
with
the
stipulation
that
after
her
death
his
own
house
in
Bishopsgate
Street
and
the
rents
from
the
Royal
Exchange
should
be
vested
in
the
Corporation
of
London
and
the
Mercers
Company
,
for
the
purpose
of
instituting
a
college
in
which
seven
professors
should
read
lectures
,
one
each
day
of
the
week
,
in
astronomy
,
geometry
,
physic
,
law
,
divinity
,
rhetoric
and
music
.

Thus
,
Gresham
College
,
the
first
institution
of
higher
learning
in
London
,
came
to
be
established
in
0000
.

Gresham
's
Law
Gresham
's
law
takes
its
name
from
him
(
although
others
,
including
the
astronomer
Nicolaus
Copernicus
,
had
recognized
the
concept
for
years
)
because
he
urged
Queen
Elizabeth
to
restore
the
debased
currency
of
England
.

However
,
Sir
Thomas
never
formulated
anything
like
Gresham
's
Law
,
which
was
the
0000
invention
of
Henry
Dunning
Macleod
,
an
economist
with
a
knack
for
reading
into
a
text
that
which
was
not
written
.

The
Gresham
grasshopper
The
grasshopper
is
the
crest
above
Gresham
's
coat
of
arms
.

It
is
used
by
Gresham
College
,
which
he
founded
,
and
can
also
be
seen
as
the
weathervane
on
the
Royal
Exchange
in
the
City
of
London
,
which
he
also
founded
in
0000
.

The
famous
Faneuil
Hall
in
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
later
borrowed
the
device
.

According
to
an
ancient
legend
of
the
Greshams
,
the
founder
of
the
family
,
Roger
de
Gresham
,
was
a
foundling
abandoned
as
a
new-born
baby
in
long
grass
in
North
Norfolk
in
the
00th
century
and
found
there
by
a
woman
whose
attention
was
drawn
to
the
child
by
a
grasshopper
.

A
beautiful
story
,
it
is
more
likely
that
the
grasshopper
is
simply
an
heraldic
rebus
on
the
name
Gresham
,
with
gres
being
a
Middle
English
form
of
grass
(
Old
English
grœs
)
.

The
Gresham
family
motto
is
Fiat
voluntas
tua
(
'
Thy
will
be
done
'
)
.

History
Brookhaven
,
Pennsylvania
was
originally
part
of
a
land
grant
given
to
William
Penn
in
0000
by
King
Charles
II
of
England
.

The
Proprietor
negotiated
with
the
Lenni-Lenape
Indians
,
who
were
the
original
occupants
of
the
land
,
the
land
was
then
divided
into
municipal
districts
.

The
area
of
Brookhaven
was
included
in
the
Municipal
District
of
Chester
Township
.

000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
were
surveyed
to
Thomas
Coebourn
who
settled
in
0000
along
with
Richard
Few
who
was
granted
000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
.

Thomas
Brassey
was
granted
000
acres
(
0.0
km
²
)
in
0000
.

These
original
grants
were
parceled
eventually
into
smaller
pieces
of
land
and
sold
to
subsequent
settlers
,
such
as
Trimble
,
Edwards
,
Lister
and
Shepherd
,
among
others
.

Many
of
these
original
settlers
have
streets
named
after
them
in
the
borough
.

The
elementary
school
is
named
Coebourn
Elementary
(
on
Coebourn
Blvd
)
after
Thomas
Coebourn
and
there
are
streets
named
Trimble
,
Edwards
,
Lister
and
Shepherd
.

For
approximately
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
,
the
region
was
dependent
upon
a
farming
and
dairy
economy
as
well
as
two
thriving
mill
businesses
spanning
both
Chester
Creek
and
Ridley
Creek
.

Bisected
by
the
0000
Edgmont
Great
Road
,
Brookhaven
developed
into
a
town
of
small
crossroads
,
at
Sneath
's
Corners
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

The
road
from
Hinkson
's
Corners
(
now
Brookhaven
Road
)
,
was
established
sometime
before
0000
as
a
service
road
to
the
mills
on
Ridley
and
to
Chester
Creeks
in
0000
.

These
byways
became
major
highways
and
at
the
crossroads
of
these
two
highways
grew
a
cluster
of
services
,
professional
offices
and
summer
homes
.

In
0000
,
the
name
"
Brookhaven
"
became
most
widely
used
after
it
was
published
in
the
letterhead
of
the
Beatty
Brothers
General
Store
at
Sneath
's
(
later
Beatty
's
)
Corners
.

The
Brookhaven
community
attracted
numerous
doctors
and
lawyers
,
and
at
the
start
of
the
00th
century
,
was
a
popular
locale
for
Sunday
outings
amongst
residents
of
the
river
tier
communities
.

Brookhaven
's
mills
were
perhaps
its
most
notable
commercial
activity
.

Thomas
Coebourn
established
the
second
gristmill
in
the
new
Pennsylvania
colony
,
successfully
challenging
William
Penn
's
monopoly
vested
in
the
Caleb
Pusey
Mill
(
the
Caleb
Pusey
house
is
still
standing
)
downstream
on
Chester
Creek
.

After
a
0000
court
battle
went
in
Coebourne
's
favor
and
granted
individuals
the
right
to
establish
mills
,
the
area
's
creeks
powered
a
multitude
of
industries
.

The
original
Coebourne
Log
Mill
was
replaced
in
0000
by
a
stone
structure
which
was
sold
to
Jonathan
Dutton
(
Dutton
Mill
Road
is
a
major
road
in
the
area
)
in
0000
.

A
redrawing
of
Chester
Township
's
borders
in
0000
placed
this
site
in
present
Middletown
Township
,
with
only
the
mill
race
and
the
owner
's
mansion
in
Brookhaven
.

The
Johnson
Ax
Factory
,
the
Lower
Bank
(
Todmorden-Sackville
)
Hair
Cloth
Mills
,
Bickley
's
Gristmill
and
the
Crozer
Cloth
Mill
all
utilized
the
notable
drop
for
streams
from
the
inland
plateau
to
power
their
machinery
.

Both
the
0000
and
the
post-flood
0000
mill
surveys
show
large
outputs
for
these
factories
.

In
the
latter
part
of
the
00th
century
,
several
large
stock
farms
were
thriving
;
by
the
0000s
most
of
these
were
consolidated
under
the
ownership
of
John
P.
Crozer
(
the
namesake
of
Crozer-Chester
Medical
Center
in
Upland
)
who
bred
racehorses
and
prize
bulls
.

After
Crozer
's
death
and
World
War
II
,
these
farms
were
sold
off
to
developers
.

In
0000
,
the
New
Chester
Water
Company
built
a
filtration
and
storage
facility
which
then
serviced
the
entire
city
and
Chester
Township
.

This
plant
,
on
Harrison
's
Hill
,
opposite
K-Mart
,
is
still
in
active
use
.

The
Delaware
Valley
's
rapid
industrial
expansion
and
the
resulting
baby
boom
of
World
War
II
,
brought
increasing
pressure
for
suburban
housing
.

At
the
time
of
Brookhaven
Borough
's
incorporation
on
April
0
,
0000
,
the
Borough
had
000
persons
and
000
homes
.

The
trolley
line
which
had
run
from
Chester
to
Media
via
Edgmont
Avenue
stopped
in
0000
.

The
trolley
tracks
were
removed
in
0000
and
the
road
was
realigned
and
widened
as
most
of
the
area
's
transportation
had
become
automotive
.

In
the
last
fifty
years
,
Brookhaven
has
evolved
very
dramatically
from
a
dairy
and
stock
farm
economy
to
a
residential
community
of
over
0,000
people
living
in
over
0,000
homes
,
apartments
and
condominiums
and
supporting
approximately
000
businesses
.

Chester
is
a
city
in
Delaware
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
,
with
a
population
of
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Chester
is
situated
on
the
Delaware
River
,
between
the
cities
of
Philadelphia
and
Wilmington
,
Delaware
.

History
The
first
European
settlers
in
the
area
were
Swedes
.

They
called
the
settlement
that
became
Chester
first
Finlandia
(
The
Latin
name
for
Finland
)
,
then
Upland
(
see
the
Swedish
province
of
Uppland
and
the
borough
of
Upland
)
.

They
built
Fort
Mecoponacka
in
0000
to
defend
the
settlement
.

By

,
Upland
was
the
most
populous
town
of
the

arrived
at
the
town
,
bearing

visit
to
the

.

Penn
renamed
the
settlement
for

.

Chester
served
as
the
county
seat
for

County
,
which
then
stretched
from
the
Delaware
River
to

River
.

In
0000
,
the
city
became
the
county
seat
for

newly
created
Delaware
County
(
whereupon
Chester
County
became
landlocked
,
with
West
Chester
as
its
county

)
,
but
the
county
seat
was
moved
to
the

shipyard
and
automobile
manufacturing
jobs
as
early
as

Clarence
D.
Bell
of
Upland
,
allows
PA
Route
000
to
maintain
at
least
two
travel
lanes
in
each
direct
between
the
refinery
towns
of
Marcus
Hook
and
Trainer
and
the
Philadelphia
International
Airport
,
as
well
as
promote
the
riverfront
development
in
the
city
.

Prior
to
the
realignment
,
which
was
done
first
,
the
roadway
followed
0nd
Street
to
Crosby
Street
,
then
bore
right
onto
E.
0th
Street
,
widening
to
four
lanes
and
becoming
the
"
Industrial
Highway
"
in
Eddystone
.

Post-realignment
,
the
road
now
follows
W.
0nd
Street
to
Concord
Avenue
,
becoming
the
"
Industrial
Highway
"
past
Concord
Avenue
and
bypassing
the
Kimberly-Clark
(
formerly
Scott
Paper
)
processing
facility
.

Highways
and
bridges
In
addition
to
State
Rt.
000
,
Chester
is
served
by
two
interstate
highways
:
Interstate
00
and
Interstate
000
,
which
meet
in
nearby
Eddystone
.

I-00
was
built
in
the
0000s
and
originally
terminated
just
north
of
the
Chester/Eddystone
line
at
the
present-day
I-00
/
I-000
junction
.

It
was
extended
north
in
the
0000s
with
the
section
around
Philadelphia
International
Airport
being
completed
in
0000
.

Three
exits
on
I-00
allow
access
to
Highland
Avenue
,
Kerlin
Street
,
and
The
Avenue
of
the
States
(
Rts
.

000
&
000
)
,
with
access
to
Widener
University
,
via
State
Rt.
000
.

Of
the
three
,
only
Kerlin
Street
is
a
partial
exit
,
although
the
Avenue
of
the
States
exit
was
also
a
partial
exit
until
the
completion
of
a
southbound
on-ramp
,
also
spearheaded
by
the
late
State
Sen.
Bell
,
was
completed
in
0000
.

I-000
,
planned
as
an
alternative
route
to
State
Rt.
000
since
the
0000s
and
an
original
planned
extension
of
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
in
the
0000s
(
as
part
of
the
Turnpike
network
)
,
was
finally
opened
to
traffic
in
0000
.

An
exit
at
MacDade
Boulevard
(
which
becomes
00nd
Street
in
Chester
)
allows
access
to
I-000
without
having
to
use
I-00
.

Two
federal
highway
routes
,
U.S.
Route
00
and
U.S.
Route
000
,
also
run
through
Chester
.

U.S.
Rt.
00
enters
Chester
from
Trainer
on
W.
0th
Street
,
becomes
part
of
Highland
Avenue
between
W.
0th
St.
and
W.
0th
Street
,
and
then
continues
on
0th
Street
to
Morton
Avenue
.

U.S.
Rt.
00
follows
Morton
Avenue
in
the
city
's
Sun
Village
section
until
it
crosses
Ridley
Creek
and
becomes
Chester
Pike
in
Eddystone
.

U.S.
Rt.
000
enters
Chester
as
a
part
of
I-00
(
merging
on
at
Highland
Avenue
)
and
then
departs
I-00
at
the
Commodore
Barry
Bridge
exit
.

Prior
to
the
bridge
's
opening
in
0000
,
U.S.
Rt.
000
would
cross
the
Delaware
River
on
the
Chester
-
Bridgeport
Ferry
,
via
Flower
Street
,
causing
major
backups
because
of
limited
space
on
the
ferries
.

With
the
expansion
of
State
Rt.
000
and
the
redevelopment
of
the
Chester
Waterfront
,
both
the
Delaware
River
Port
Authority
and
PennDOT
built
a
pair
of
entrance
(
westbound
)
and
exit
(
eastbound
)
ramps
to
PA
Rt.
000
,
providing
direct
access
to
the
waterfront
without
using
local
streets
.

The
ramps
were
built
between
0000
and
0000
and
were
opened
in
0000
.

In
addition
,
talks
have
taken
place
for
the
reconstruction
of
U.S.
Rt.
000
from
a
two-lane
road
to
a
four-lane
road
between
Chester
and
U.S.
0
in
Concordville
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
the
Highland
Avenue
exit
.

The
road
currently
requires
traffic
to
merge
onto
I-00
in
the
left
lane
and
requires
changing
lanes
three
times
to
the
Commodore
Barry
Bridge
exit
ramp
in
less
than
a
mile
.

Such
a
major
undertaking
would
result
in
the
demolition
of
numerous
homes
in
the
city
's
crime-plagued
Highland
Gardens
section
,
along
with
condemning
properties
in
nearby
Chester
Township
,
as
I-00
passes
through
both
municipalities
between
U.S.
Rt.
000
and
the
Commodore
Barry
Bridge
.

Public

,
which
acquired
the
former
Suburban
Philadelphia

)
in
0000
.

Seven

serve
the
city
,
with
the
Chester

Center
in
the
city
's
business
district
,
serving
as
the
hub
.

One
route
,
Route

,
connects
Chester
with
Philadelphia
and
the
Philadelphia
International
Airport
,
while
another
,
Route
000
from
00th

Delaware
.

Both
Routes
00
and
000
provides
direct
service
with
the
Harrah

,
while
serving
as
the
main
bus
hub
in
the
city
,
also
serves
as
the
main
train
station
in
the
city
,
while
the

,
located
approximately
0
miles
southwest
of
Chester
T.C.

.

A
third
station
,
at
Lamokin
Street
,
located
approximately
a
mile
east
of
the
Commodore
Barry
Bridge
at
the
junction
of
the
NEC
and
the
abandoned
Penn
Central
Chester
Creek
Secondary
Branch
,
was
operated
by
SEPTA
as
a
flagstop
station
until
it
was
closed
and
demolished
in
0000
due
to
low
usage
.

Historically
,
the
Chester
Transportation
Center
was
,
like
the
Paoli
station
on
the
Paoli/Thorndale
Line
,
both
a
commuter
and
intercity
stop
on
the
former
Pennsylvania
Railroad
's
New
York
-
Washington
route
.

But
when
Amtrak
took
over
intercity
rail
passenger
services
in
0000
,
the
Chester
Transportation
Center
was
bypassed
,
except
from
April
00
,
0000
,
to
October
00
,
0000
,
when
the
Chesapeake
stopped
once
daily
in
each
direction
between
Philadelphia
and
Washington
.

Chester
Heights
is
a
borough
in
Delaware
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Most
of
the
borough
lies
south
of
U.S.
0
,
about
a
mile
southwest
of
Wawa
,
Pennsylvania
.

History
The
History
of
Chester
Heights
predates
grants
of
William
Penn
,
when
the
Swedes
had
penetrated
some
distance
inland
from
the
Delaware
River
and
had
found
the
rich
soil
very
conducive
to
productive
farming
.

To
a
remarkable
extent
,
the
area
had
continued
to
be
so
used
until
the
last
decade
.

In
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
,
the
Borough
was
part
of
Aston
Township
,
though
this
northernmost
section
of
Aston
did
not
have
a
village
aspect
as
such
.

With
the
advent
of
a
railroad
,
which
made
its
first
run-through
on
Christmas
Day
0000
,
a
concentration
of
houses
developed
.

With
the
reach
of
the
automobile
,
a
settlement
of
homes
sprang
up
along
the
oldest
road
in
the
Borough
.

That
route
—
now
Valleybrook
Road
was
once
known
as
the
"
Logtown
Road
"
and
was
one
of
the
earliest
routes
from
Chester
settlement
to
the
interior
.

It
wanders
over
and
along
the
West
Branch
of
Chester
Creek
and
is
noted
for
its
abrupt
curves
at
the
Borough
's
southern
end
.

An
0000
School
Building
on
Valleybrook
Road
and
Llewellyn
Road
was
,
in
its
day
,
rented
by
its
owners
to
Aston
for
$
0
a
month
for
use
as
the
school
for
this
area
.

It
was
subsequently
known
as
the
Logtown
School
and
changed
to
the
Chester
Heights
School
in
0000
.

A
second
,
much
later
stone
school
building
stands
in
its
place
today
.

The
Borough
was
the
Fourth
Ward
of
Aston
and
had
been
referred
to
for
some
time
as
Chester
Heights
and
Wawa
.

It
was
in
the
northern
or
"
Wawa
"
area
that
,
over
the
past
one
hundred
years
or
more
,
several
large
land
parcels
were
acquired
for
summer
residences
.

To
date
,
most
of
these
tracts
have
remained
relatively
unchanged
,
though
they
are
now
used
as
year-round
private
residences
.

(
"
Wawa
"
was
the
Indian
name
for
wild
goose
.
)

In
0000
the
cornerstone
of
the
Catholic
Church
"
St.
Thomas
the
Apostle
"
was
laid
,
and
it
stands
today
with
the
addition
of
a
parochial
school
and
residences
.

In
0000
an
association
of
Methodists
purchased
a
farm
in
Aston
,
incorporating
as
the
Chester
Heights
Camp-Meeting
Associations
,
and
it
still
convenes
each
July
for
religious
retreats
.

The
Borough
of
Chester
Heights
was
officially
incorporated
in
0000
.

Finally
,
approximately
one
dozen
early
fieldstone
or
brick
dwellings
remain
intact
though
not
necessarily
restored
.

The
oldest
homes
date
to
0000
or
earlier
;
many
of
them
were
established
by
0000
when
"
a
number
of
the
stragglers
from
the
defeated
American
Army
,
hungry
,
demoralized
and
exhausted
in
their
flight
from
the
field
at
Brandywine
,
collected
in
the
neighborhood
of
Logtown
,
where
they
passed
the
night
,
sleeping
in
the
outbuildings
and
open
fields
.

History
The
paper
for
the
first
currency
printed
by
the
Continental
Congress
was
made
at
the
Willcox
Ivy
Mill
.

The
mill
specialized
in
making
paper
for
legal
and
ecclesiastical
uses
.

The
oldest
Catholic
church
in
the
Diocese
of
Philadelphia
was
located
at
the
Willcox
Ivy
Mill
.

The
church
was
later
moved
approximately
one
mile
east
to
the
top
of
the
hill
into
what
later
would
become
the
Borough
of
Chester
Heights
and
is
known
as
St.
Thomas
the
Apostle
Church
.

The
Newlin
Grist
Mill
has
been
grinding
grain
since
0000
.

It
has
an
tall
stone
wheel
housed
in
a
timber
frame
.

The
mill
and
processing
complex
had
later
passed
through
various
hands
,
but
in
the
0000s
it
was
purchased
by
a
direct
descendant
of
Nicholas
Newlin
,
which
along
with
of
surrounding
countryside
became
the
Newlin
Mill
Historic
Park
.

The
mill
complex
area
was
home
to
the
Markham
post
office
and
Markham
train
station
(

)
The
name
"
Concord
"
was
believed
to
have
been
given
by
the
earliest
European
settlers
of
the
township
and
reflects
the
harmonious
feelings
among
them
at
the
time
.

Title
to
all
real
estate
in
the
township
can
be
traced
back
to
a
grant
from
William
Penn.
.

Concord
Township
was
a
part
of
Chester
County
until
0000
,
at
which
point
Delaware
County
was
created
by
act
of
legislature
.

Farmers
in
the
northern
and
western
reaches
of
Chester
County
were
weary
of
travelling
a
period
of
days
to
get
to
the
county
seat
in
Chester
,
on
the
Delaware
River
.

The
seat
of
Chester
County
was
moved
to
Turk
's
Head
,
now
West
Chester
,
and
was
centrally
located
in
the
county
.

The

a
public
library
founded
in

speculation

related
to
"
Derby
"
derived
from
the
English
town
of

,
in
the

of
Derbyshire
.

One
explanation
states
that
the
Darby
Creek
closely
resembled
the
English
River
Derwent
,
the
main
body
of
water
that
flows
through
Derby
.

British
immigrants
named
the
town
in

Eddystone
is
a
borough
in
Delaware
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Early
history
The
area
at
the
mouth
of
Ridley
Creek
was
first
called
"
Tequirassy
"
by
Native
Americans
.

The
land
was
owned
by
Olof
Persson
Stille
,
one
of
the
early
settlers
from
New
Sweden
,
who
had
immigrated
in
0000
.

Olof
Stille
,
a
millwright
by
trade
,
came
from
Penningby
Manor
in
Länna
in
the
county
of
Uppland
,
north
of
Stockholm
,
Sweden
.

After
the
conquest
of
the
colony
by
the
Dutch
in
0000
,
Stille
was
one
of
the
four
commissaries
or
magistrates
appointed
to
administer
justice
among
the
inhabitants
,
and
thus
became
a
judge
of
the
first
court
on
the
banks
of
the
Delaware
.

The
Borough
of
Eddystone
was
formed
around
the
Eddystone
Print
Works
.

William
Simpson
&
Sons
established
the
Eddystone
Print
Works
on
the
land
that
is
now
Eddystone
in
October
0000
,
after
the
land
on
which
their
previous
factory
had
operated
was
condemned
to
make
way
for
Fairmount
Park
.

Eddystone
Borough
was
incorporated
on
December
0
,
0000
.

Eddystone
's
petition
for
incorporation
was
challenged
in
court
on
several
grounds
,
including
that
"
the
finances
of
the
township
of
Ridley
and
of
the
Ridley
school
district
will
be
diminished
by
the
creation
of
this
borough
.
"

On
December
0
,
0000
,
the
Delaware
County
Court
of
Common
Pleas
issued
an
opinion
rejecting
these
claims
,
noting
that
while
Ridley
's
"
revenues
...
will
be
diminished
,
so
will
its
burdens
.
"

It
was
the
site
of
the
largest
Baldwin
Locomotive
Works
plant
(
the
smaller
being
in
Spring
Garden
,
Philadelphia
)
.

Baldwin
was
once
the
largest
manufacturer
of
steam
locomotive
s
in
the
world
.

Today
an
Exelon
generating
station
occupies
some
of
the
riverfront
.

The
Platt-LePage
Aircraft
Company
built
some
of
the
earliest
rotorcraft
on
adjacent
land
to
the
northeast
(
outside
the
borough
)
.

The
site
's
association
with
military
helicopters
continued
through
McDonnell
Aircraft
and
McDonnell
Douglas
all
the
way
to
the
present
,
as
a
Boeing
Integrated
Defense
Systems
plant
now
operates
there
.

During
World
War
I
,
Remington
Arms
opened
the
Eddystone
Rifle
Plant
on
Baldwin
land
with
Baldwin
management
.

Here
it
produced
the
Pattern
0000
Enfield
rifle
and
M0000
Enfield
rifle
.

A
large
portion
of
the
rifles
used
by
American
soldiers
in
France
in
World
War
I
were
made
at
Eddystone
.

In
January
0000
Remington
Arms
was
absorbed
by
Midvale
Steel
and
Ordnance
Company
,
which
took
over
the
rifle
plant
.

Baldwin
also
formed
a
subsidiary
company
(
Eddystone
Ammunition
Corporation
)
in
0000
to
build
artillery
shells
(
Russian-model
on
British
order
)
.

On
00
April
0000
,
000
people
were
killed
in
an
explosion
at
the
artillery
shell
plant
.

A
monument
near
the
Edgmont
Avenue
side
of
the
Chester
Rural
Cemetery
marks
the
final
resting
place
for
the
remains
of
the
unidentified
victims
,
mostly
women
and
young
girls
.

In
0000
the
U.S.
government
also
placed
artillery
shell
orders
,
and
bought
out
some
of
the
assets
of
the
Eddystone
Ammunition
Corporation
.

A
new
corporation
,
the
similarly
named
Eddystone
Munitions
Company
,
was
formed
by
Baldwin
to
make
the
shrapnel
for
the
shells
.

History
The
name
Folcroft
comes
from
an
Old
English
word
meaning
"
Leafy
Fields
"
.

The
name
was
recorded
first
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
state
historical
marker
which
was
on
Chester
Pike
says
"
Folcroft
:
Old
English
for
leafy
green
meadow/field
.
"

The
property
was
originally
part
of
a
land
grant
given
by
William
Penn
to
England-born
Obadiah
Bonsall
.

Bonsall
never
lived
there
but
rented
the
property
in
0000
to
Thomas
Tatnall
,
and
he
and
his
wife
Ann
bought
the
property
the
same
year
.

Tatnall
,
a
member
of
the
Pennsylvania
Assembly
in
the
0000
¹
s
,
added
another
to
the
property
.

He
died
about
0000
leaving
his
property
to
his
only
child
Elizabeth
and
her
heirs
.

Elizabeth
had
married
John
Knowles
,
son
of
an
English
immigrant
,
and
Knowles
inherited
the
entire
estate
upon
her
death
around
0000
.

Knowles
continued
to
add
more
property
to
the
farm
and
by
0000
it
totaled
over
.

He
was
then
the
largest
landowner
in
the
area
.

John
Knowles
died
about
January
0000
.

His
will
provided
that
his
three
children
,
James
,
John
and
Hannah
,
be
taken
to
land
he
owned
in
Berks
County
,
"
there
to
dwell
and
reside
during
the
present
troubles
in
British
America

Not
until
the
American
Revolution
was
over
in
0000
did
the
three
children
divide
the
estate
.

Hannah
Knowles
received
and
married
Joseph
Shallcross
.

Together
in
0000
they
built
the
house
called
Poplar
Hall
at
Shallcross
Ave.
in
what
is
today
Folcroft
.

The
Hahn-Cooke
Farm
was
centered
at
Cooke
Avenue
and
Chester
Pike
where
the
farmhouse
still
stands
.

Part
of
the
original
Knowles
Farm
,
the
parcel
was
sold
to
the
Justis
Family
before
0000
and
they
built
a
log
cabin
on
the
property
.

Hahn
operated
a
fruit
and
dairy
farm
on
the
.

He
died
in
early
0000
and
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
will
,
his
wife
Mary
sold
the
farm
at
a
public
auction
held
on
Monday
,
February

,
0000
.

The
farm
was
bought
by
Lewis
D.
Cooke
.

Cooke
sold
the
farm
to
Theodore
Lamont
of
Philadelphia
in
June
0000
.

A
few
months
later
,
Louis
Dalmas
owned
the
property
briefly
,
planning
to
divide
the
property
into
building
lots
.

The
property
was
then
bought
by
the
Wood-Harmon
Company
who
were
developing
Warwick
(
Folcroft
)
just
south
of
the
farm
.

Needing
access
to
Chester
Pike
,
Wood-Harmon
Co.
bought
the
farm
in
late
0000
and
named
it
Warwick
Annex
.

Today
,
Warwick
Annex
is
a
part
of
southeast
Glenolden

Warwick
has
passed

(
From
the
Chester
Times
,
April
00
,
0000
)
The
majority
of
H.K.
Mulford
Company
¹
s
property
was
in
today
¹
s
Folcroft
borough
.

Originally
a
New
York
firm
with
another
office
in
Chicago
,
the
H.K.
Mulford
company
opened
their
"
Manufacturing
Chemists
"
in
0000
in
a
Philadelphia
office
at
Market
and
Eighteenth
Streets
.

Besides
marketing
medicines
,
the
firm
also
made
liquors
&
wines
.

About
0000
the
company
moved
to
the
William
F.
Simes
drugstore
at
000-000
South
Street
,
Philadelphia
.

The
Simes
drugstore
was
said
to
be
the
oldest
drugstore
in
the
United
States
.

H.K.
Mulford
became
the
first
company
in
the
United
States
to
commercially
provide
the
diphtheria
antitoxin
.

The
company
soon
needed
more
room
for
expansion
and
in
0000
bought
of
land
Simes
owned
in
Glenolden
.

The
firm
added
part
of
Ridgeway
Farm
and
a
large
part
of
the
Glenolden
Farm
to
their
holdings
which
by
now
totaled
over
.

The
Folcroft
property
was
used
as
grazing
land
for
their
numerous
farm
animals
.

The
horses
and
cows
were
needed
to
produce
the
smallpox
and
diphtheria
toxins
and
serums
.

The
would
eventually
contain
00
buildings
.

By
0000
,
H.K.
Mulford
Company
introduced
a
smallpox
vaccine
which
was
ready
to
be
used
in
their
patented
syringe
.

The
company
also
grew
acres
of
plants
used
in
medical
research
and
some
say
that
marijuana
and
morphine
were
grown
on
the
farm
for
these
purposes
.

In
0000
the
Maryland
firm
of
Sharpe
&
Dohme
bought
out
H.K.
Mulford
and
incorporated
under
the
name
of
Sharpe
&
Dohme
Inc.
.

The
company
continued
the
original
work
in
medical
research
and
experimentation
and
made
many
important
medical
discoveries
now
in
general
use
.

During
World
War
II
,
Sharpe
&
Dohme
Inc.
was
the
first
pharmaceutical
company
to
produce
dried
blood
plasma
for
the
Armed
Forces
.

When
the
demand
for
the
plasma
became
greater
than
Sharpe
&
Dohme
could
handle
,
they
gave
other
pharmaceutical
firms
their
technique
for
making
the
dried
plasma
and
charged
them
nothing
for
the
information
.

Sharpe
&
Dohme
also
supplied
influenza
vaccine
to
the
Armed
Forces
.

After
the
war
,
Sharpe
&
Dohme
concentrated
on
animal
health
and
nutrition
and
discovered
thibenzole
,
a
product
which
de-worms
livestock
.

In
0000
,
Sharpe
&
Dohme
merged
with
Merck
&
Co.
to
form
Merck
,
Sharpe
&
Dohme
.

With
this
merger
,
the
company
began
to
sell
off
their
land
holdings
in
the
area
.

By
0000
,
Merck
,
Sharpe
&
Dohme
had
sold
most
of
their
property
and
moved
to
West
Point
,
Pa.
.

The
remaining
property
was
bought
by
the
Allied
Chemical
&
Dye
Co.
whose
Barrett
Division
worked
on
the
development
of
coal
and
tar
products
.

During
this
time
,
the
original
H.K.
Mulford
Company
buildings
were
torn
down
and
the
California
Apartments
built
on
their
site
.

Chester
Pike
was
a
toll
road
from
the
0000
¹
s
until
0000
when
the
state
bought
the
Road
.

Before
0000
,
students
had
two
public
school
options
.

The
school
district
of
Darby
Township
had
the
"
Southern
"
School
on
Calcon
Hook
Road
close
to
Ashland
Avenue
&
the
"
Western
"
school
on
Oak
Avenue
at
Chester
Pike
.

Built
in
the
0000
¹
s
,
the
"
Western
"
school
was
built
as
a
one
room
brick
school
,
it
was
replaced
by
the
current
building
in
0000
.

Today
the
"
Western
"
school
at
00
Oak
Lane
,
Folcroft
,
is
a
day
care
center
.

The
Glencroft
Baptist
Church
was
originally
organized
in
September
,
0000
.

The
first
meeting
was
held
at
the
home
of
Harry
Bowd
on
Bayard
Avenue
in
Folcroft
.

Services
grew
too
big
for
a
private
house
and
the
church
was
moved
to

three-car
garage
of

still
stands
by

church
in

helped
to
form
a
Sunday
Church
School
,
which
first
met
on
April
0
of
that

Seventy
children
and

convened
for

the
vacant
public
school
building
on
Folcroft
Avenue
(

.

At
the
start
of
the
new
year
,
0000
,
the
church
's
indebtedness
from
the
former
school
building
purchase
was
paid
off
,
and
it
became
apparent
that

and
to
fulfill
its
mission
,
the
church
would
have
to
seek
a
new
location

was
broken
for
the
new
building
at
the
corner
of
Glen
and
Folcroft
Avenues
on

were
conducted
.

Upon
completion

dedication
services
for
the
new
building
were
held
on

Because
of
the
crowded
public
school
conditions
,
in
the
Autumn
of

the
Folcroft
School
District
began
using
the
church

the
Court
of
Chester
County
approved
the
construction
of
"
Providence
Great
Road
"
(
now

.

The

,
which
runs
north

,
is
shown
on
a

It
forms
the
eastern
border
of
the

.

Thomas
Minshall
,
a
Quaker
,
was
an
early
Media
resident
,
settling
just
outside
the
small
village
then
known
as
Providence
,
along
the
Providence
Great
Road
.

The
village
then
included
a
tailor
shop
,
blacksmith
shop
,
wheelwright
shop
,
barn
and
other
buildings
.

Minshall
bought
from
William
Penn
and
arrived
in
0000
.

The
Providence
Friends
Meeting
was
established
at
his
house
in
February
,
0000
,
and
a
meetinghouse
was
later
built
on
land
he
donated
for
the
purpose
.

The
original
meetinghouse
was
built
out
of
logs
in
0000
or
0000
and
the
current
building
dates
to
0000
.

Minshall
’s
house
still
stands
and
was
given
to
the
citizens
of
the
borough
in
0000
.

During
the
American
Revolution
the
Marquis
de
La
Fayette
bought
a
saddle
at
the
Minshall
house
.

The
area
remained
rural
through
0000
.

On
March

,
0000
the
State
of
Pennsylvania
by
Special
Act
of
Assembly
incorporated
the
Borough
of
Media
,
and
made
the
sale
of
malt
and
spirituous
liquors
unlawful
within
its
borders
.

At
the
same
time
the
county
seat
of
Delaware
County
was
moved
to
Media
from
Chester
.

The
borough
was
formed
from
four
farms
purchased
by
the
county
,
totalling
only
.

The
borders
of
the
borough
have
not
changed
since
that
time
.

Streets
were
plotted
in
a
rectangular
grid
around
the
location
of
the
new
courthouse
,
lots
were
sold
at
public
auctions
,
and
the
construction
of
houses
began
.

Sources
agree
that
Minshall
Painter
,
a
descendant
of
Thomas
Minshall
,
suggested
the
name
"
Media
"
,
but
do
not
agree
on
the
reason
.

The
name
may
come
from
the
city
’s
central
location
in
Delaware
County
,
or
from
the
biblical
area
of
Medea
.

Newtown
Township
,
generally
known
as
Newtown
Square
,
is
a
township
in
Delaware
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Prior
to
0000
it
was
part
of
Chester
County
.

Including
its
history
as
part
of
Chester
County
,
it
is
the
oldest
township
in
Delaware
County
.

The
population
was
00,000
as
of
the
0000
census
.

History
Newtown
Square
Township
was
settled
in
0000
and
incorporated
as
a
Township
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
William
Penn
planned
the
"
first
inland
town
west
of
Philadelphia
"
at
the
intersection
of
Goshen
Road
(
laid
out
in
0000
)
and
Newtown
Street
Road
(
laid
out
in
0000
)
.

The
Township
was
laid
out
around
a
center
square
,
or
"
townstead
"
of
approximately
one
square
mile
surrounded
by
farmland
.

Original
purchasers
of
land
in
the
Township
received
in
the
townstead
for
every
ten
acres
of
surrounding
farm
land
.

Penn
has
planned
New
Town
while
still
in
England
and
was
able
to
sell
a
considerable
number
of
tracts
before
leaving
England
.

However
,
many
of
these
people
"
...
never
lived
on
the
land
,
"
the
properties
changed
hands
many
times
,
and
thus
,
early
growth
of
the
Township
was
slow
.

Newtown
Square
was
the
name
used
for
the
townstead
with
the
majority
of
early
settlers
being
Welshman
.

These
Welsh
"
Friends
"
(
Quakers
)
needed
a
road
to
facilitate
their
journey
to
meeting
,
the
only
established
road
at
the
time
being
Newtown
Street
Road
,
which
ran
north
and
south
.

As
such
,
in
0000
,
an
east-west
road
was
laid
out
(
Goshen
Road
)
so
the
Friends
could
attend
either
Goshen
or
Haverford
Meeting
.

By
0000
,
these
friends
had
become
numerous
enough
to
hold
their
own
meeting
in
Newtown
and
continued
to
meet
in
a
private
home
until
the
completion
of
the
Newtown
Friends
Meetinghouse
in
0000
.

In
the
00th
century
,
Newtown
was
basically
a
farming
community
.

Blacksmith
and
wheelwright
shops
emerged
on
the
main
arteries
to
service
horse
and
buggy
travelers
.

Taverns
and
inns
were
also
opened
to
accommodate
local
patrons
as
well
as
drovers
taking
their
livestock
to
the
markets
in
Philadelphia
.

During
the
00th
century
a
number
of
mills
sprang
up
along
Crum
Creek
(
the
western
border
)
and
Darby
Creek
(
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
Township
)
.

These
included
saw
mills
,
paper
mills
,
shingle
mills
,
and
a
woolen
factory
.

In
the
Darby
Creek
area
a
number
of
tenement
houses
were
built
as
well
as
a
general
store
to
service
the
needs
of
the
mill
workers
.

In
0000
,
the
population
of
Newtown
Township
was
000
;
the
population
of
Philadelphia
was
approximately
half
a
million
.

At
this
time
,
the
railroad
,
so
called
the
"
Iron
horse
,
"
was
laying
track
out
of
Philadelphia
in
all
directions
with
service
to
Chester
,
Media
,
West
Chester
,
and
Radnor
...
but
not
Newtown
Square
.

As
these
towns
,
as
well
as
stops
along
the
way
,
grew
and
prospered
,
mills
closed
and
businesses
declined
in
Newtown
Square
.

By
0000
,
the
population
had
fallen
to
000
.

As
an
agricultural
community
,
stone
farmhouses
graced
the
country
landscape
throughout
the
00th
century
.

Additions
were
made
to
the
early
simple
dwellings
as
families
grew
and
more
living
space
was
required
.

Prosperity
,
due
to
a
growing
market
,
also
enabled
property
owners
to
make
additions
,
not
only
to
their
own
homes
,
but
on
the
property
as
well
as
in
the
form
of
tenements
and
outbuildings
.

In
0000
,
the
Rose
Tree
hunt
Club
was
organized
south
of
the
Township
,
followed
by
the
Lima
Hunt
Club
to
the
west
(
0000
)
and
the
Radnor
Hunt
Club
at
the
intersection
of
Darby-Paoli
and
Goshen
Roads
in
0000
.

With
these
developments
,
many
country
estates
were
built
in
the
rolling
hills
of
Newtown
Square
for
"
...
either
country
gentlemen
of
Old
Quaker
blood
...
or
rich
Philadelphians
who
loved
hunting
,
owned
good
horses
,
and
were
not
afraid
to
ride
them
.
"

Major
transportation
developments
for
the
Township
did
not
occur
until
the
mid-0000s
,
when
trolley
service
was
opened
to
Newtown
Square
.

Before
this
time
,
railroad
lines
had
been
proposed
,
but
due
to
a
series
of
reorganizations
and
competition
between
companies
for
right-of-ways
as
of
0000
,
no
track
had
been
laid
.

In
0000
,
however
,
mule
drawn
service
was
initiated
by
the
Philadelphia
and
Delaware
County
Railroad
,
with
steam
dummies
used
to
help
out
on
the
hills
.

Electrification
was
completed
the
following
year
and
the
trolley
was
open
from
Newtown
to
Fernwood
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
the
reorganized
Philadelphia
and
West
Chester
Traction
Company
had
completed
the
track
to
West
Chester
.

At
the
turn
of
the
00th
Century
,
the
automobile
began
to
disperse
the
urban
populations
over
the
countryside
.

The
trolleys
,
along
with
the
new
"
horseless
carriage
,
"
transformed
the
country
farmers
into
suburban
commuters
.

Farms
were
sold
and
the
land
subdivided
.

Many
city
dwellers
retained
their
country
estates
,
however
,
these
became
hidden
amidst
gridiron
developments
.

Although
construction
slackened
during
the
depression
,
another
boom
was
experienced
after
World
War
II
.

Today
Newtown
Square
township
has
a
land
area
of
,
and
a
population
of
00,000
individuals
.

Some
farms
and
large
estates
remain
,
but
for
the
most
part
,
the
Township
was
developed
into
a
suburban
community
with
old
stone
homes
and
structures
dotting
the
landscape
to
serve
as
reminders

History
Prospect
Hill
Baptist
Church

claims
a
prominent
role
in
instituting
the
phrase
"
In
God
We
Trust
"
on
United
States
coins
and
currency
.

A
former
Pastor
Mark
R.
Watkinson
felt
that
the
civil
war
was
going
to
leave
the
country
with
a
bad
name
,
"
brother
fighting
brother
in
a
civil
war
"
,
and
wrote
a
letter
to
then
Sam
Chase
,
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
,
suggesting
"
God
,
Liberty
,
Law
,
"
be
put
on
the
coins
.

Salmon
P.
Chase
acted
on
Watkinson
's
letter
by
referring
the
matter
to
James
B.
Longacre
,
Mint
Engraver
.

A
Committee
later
settled
on
"
In
God
we
Trust
"
and
the
words
first
appeared
on
a
0
Cent
coin

History
Native
American
The
Lenape
inhabited
the
Delaware
River
region
several
centuries
before
the
arrival
of
European
explorers
and
traders
.

The
Okehocking
Tribe
of
the
Lenni
Lenape
Nation
established
small
permanent
villages
along
the
river
and
its
main
tributaries
.

Land
adjacent
to
Stoney
Creek
in
Ridley
Township
has
been
identified
as
a
Native
American
town
site
.

Historians
also
believe
that
additional
villages
may
have
existed
at
other
locations
along
Stoney
Creek
and
Crum
Creek
in
Ridley
Park
.

Native
Americans
significantly
influenced
the
built
environment
through
their
network
of
paths
laid
out
for
travel
and
communication
purposes
.

Their
footpaths
through
the
densely
forested
countryside
grew
into
the
first
roads
of
the
area
.

Chester
Pike
is
believed
to
have
developed
from
a
footpath
created
by
the
Lenni
Lenape
as
their
main
thoroughfare
in
the
area
.

Colonial
The
borough
is
named
after
a
place
in
Cheshire
,
England
.

John
Morton
,
signer
of
the
American
Declaration
of
Independence
,
was
born
and
raised
in
a
log
cabin
adjacent
to
East
Ridley
Avenue
.

He
later
replaced
the
cabin
with
a
brick
house
and
began
farming
in
the
Ridley
Park
area
.

Chester
Pike
,
originally
a
footpath
,
was
realigned
and
widened
by
William
Penn
.

Known
then
as
the
“
Queens
Highway
,
”
it
was
one
of
the
region
’s
first
roads
stretching
from
Chester
to
Darby
,
and
by
0000
,
it
reached
Philadelphia
.

General
George
Washington
led
his
troops
down
this
earthen
road
to
Wilmington
and
eventually
to
Brandywine
to
confront
the
British
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
“
Queens
Highway
”
was
improved
as
a
plank
road
,
and
tolls
were
levied
.

The
population
of
the
area
continued
to
increase
after
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.

Consequently
,
a
private
elementary
subscription
school
was
founded
in
0000
on
a
site
at
Chester
Pike
and
Myrtle
Avenue
.

This
was
one
of
the
first
schools
in
Delaware
County
.

Railroad
suburb
Ridley
Park
was
founded
by
Isaac
Hinckley
in
0000
.

He
was
the
President
of
the
Philadelphia
,
Wilmington
&
Baltimore
Railroad
.

He
wanted
to
expand
the
company
’s
rail
line
to
gain
more
business
in
the
same
way
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
had
earlier
created
a
Main
Line
from
00th
Street
Station
in
Philadelphia
to
Paoli
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
bought
up
farmland
and
developed
towns
all
along
its
rail
line
.

City
dwellers
,
seeking
relief
from
the
urban
crowds
with
their
potential
to
spread
malaria
a
disease
that
was
a
major
health
concern
at
the
time
,
quickly
purchased
the
new
homes
being
built
.

Seeing
the
success
of
this
,
Hinckley
came
up
with
the
idea
of
putting
in
a
rail
line
that
would
pass
through
Darby
and
continue
all
the
way
to
the
semi-rural
city
of
Chester
in
what
became
known
as
the
Darby
Improvement
Hinckley
's
plans
met
with
initial
resistance
from
farmers
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
,
he
had
managed
to
buy
only
one
farm
.

Undaunted
,
he
traveled
further
south
on
Chester
Pike
to
the
area
now
known
as
Ridley
Park
.

In
an
effort
to
avoid
his
previous
bad
experience
,
in
May
0000
,
Hinckley
formed
an
association
to
acquire
the
land
.

Hinckley
hired
Robert
Morris
Copeland
,
a
noted
Boston
landscape
architect
,
to
develop
a
master
plan
for
a
suburban
park
community
which
became
known
as
the
Borough
of
Ridley
Park
.

Copeland
’s
design
is
Delaware
County
’s
first
master
planned
community
.

Because
of
its
beautifully
landscaped
streets
and
parks
,
and
its
man-made
lake
,
Ridley
Park
became
popular
in
the
late
00th
century
and
early
part
of
the
00th
century
as
a
summer
resort
for
wealthy
Philadelphians
who
built
most
of
the
Victorian
style
homes
still
lived
in
today
.

Between
January
and
May
0000
,
many
farms
were
purchased
.

The
streets
in
the
new
development
were
named
after
the
families
who
sold
their
farmland
.

Names
such
as
Burk
,
Dutton
,
Free
,
Henderson
,
Stewart
and
Ward
,
are
still
used
today
.

The
first
train
of
passengers-cars
stopped
at
Ridley
Park
on
October
00
,
0000
.

By
that
time
,
the
town
had
a
hotel
,
and
a
dam
had
been
built
across
Crum
Creek
,
creating
a
lake
.

By
0000
,
the
U.S.
census
return
recorded
the
population
of
Ridley
Park
as
000
.

The
railroad
was
,
and
continues
today
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
town
.

Crafts
community
by
architect
Will
Price
,
who
bought

History
Native
Americans
of
the
Leni
Lenape
or
Delaware
tribe
lived
in
the
area
when
Europeans
began
arriving
.

A
major
trade
route
,
the
Great
Minquas
Path
,
passed
though
the
site
of
the
present
borough
,
along
Long
Point
,
a
hairpin
turn
in
Ridley
Creek
,
and
then
across
the
creek
and
through
the
center
of
the
borough
.

Furs
were
carried
along
the
path
from
Native
Americans
on
the
Susquehanna
River
to
European
traders
on
the
Schuylkill
and
Delaware
River
s.
Soon
after
William
Penn
received
his
charter
for
the
Colony
of
Pennsylvania
,
three
brothers
,
Thomas
,
Robert
,
and
Randall
Vernon
received
land
grants
from
Penn
to
settle
over
000
acres
in
the
present
borough
of
Rose
Valley
and
Nether
Providence
Township
.

The
brothers
arrived
in
Pennsylvania
in
0000
and
began
farming
the
area
,
about
0
miles
north
of
Chester
,
which
was
then
the
largest
settlement
in
the
colony
.

Though
the
brothers
purchased
their
land
in
0000
while
still
in
London
,
the
land
was
not
surveyed
and
patents
were
not
granted
for
the
land
until
years
,
perhaps
decades
,
later
.

The
Providence
Great
Road
(
now
PA
000
)
,
just
to
the
north
of
the
borough
,
was
laid
out
in
the
0000s
,
and
Brookhaven
Road
,
on
the
borough
's
eastern
boundary
was
laid
out
in
0000
.

Randall
Vernon
's
house
was
built
before
0000
,
and
still
stands
.

Robert
Vernon
may
have
built
the
house
known
as
the
"
Bishop
White
House
"
about
0000
.

The
name
of
the
house
comes
from
its
use
by
the
family
of
Bishop
William
White
during
the
yellow
fever
epidemic
of
0000
in
Philadelphia
.

Though
the
Bishop
visited
the
house
,
he
generally
stayed
in
Philadelphia
in
0000
.

Will
Price
modified
this
house
after
0000
,
adding
a
stone
porch
and
red
tile
roof
.

The
Vernon
families
continued
living
in
the
area
into
the
nineteenth
century
.

The
American
Revolution
split
family
members
,
who
served
as
soldiers
on
both
the
American
and
British
sides
.

Many
veterans
of
the
Revolution
are
buried
in
now
unmarked
graves
in
the
cemetery
of
the
Old
Union
Methodist
Church
,
the
only
church
in
the
borough
.

The
roots
of
the
church
may
go
back
to
0000
,
and
it
was
officially
organized
in
0000
.

The
current
building
dates
to
0000
.

Following
the
Revolution
land
in
the
southwest
corner
of
the
present
borough
was
confiscated
from
a
Vernon
family
member
who
had
supported
the
British
.

The
land
was
eventually
sold
to
Jacob
Benninghove
,
a
Philadelphia
tobacconist
,
who
built
a
large
mansion
there
in
0000
.

About
the
same
time
he
built
a
dam
on
Ridley
Creek
and
a
water
powered
snuff
mill
.

Samuel
Bankcroft
bought
the
house
in
0000
and
named
it
Todmorden
Mansion
.

He
lost
the
house
in
bankruptcy
in
0000
,
but
bought
it
back
in
0000
and
lived
there
until
0000
.

He
built
tunnels
and
secret
chambers
in
the
house
for
use
in
the
Underground
Railroad
.

Mills
At
least
three
mills
operated
in
the
area
of
Rose
Valley
.

Little
remains
except
a
silted-in
dam
pond
of
what
may
have
been
the
earliest
mill
,
located
on
Vernon
Run
near
the
present
Pool
and
Tennis
Club
.

Near
the
Bishop
White
House
,
on
Ridley
Creek
,
the
remains
of
a
dam
and
millrace
can
be
seen
leading
up
to
the
"
Old
Mill
,
"
which
is
now
used
as
the
town
hall
.

Benninghove
's
snuff
mill
was
likely
built
here
c.
0000
.

Between
0000
and
0000
it
was
run
as
a
paper
mill
.

It
was
reconstructed
as
a
textile
mill
in
0000
and
burned
down
in
0000
.

After
0000
Will
Price
built
a
furniture
mill
or
craft
shop
on
the
foundations
and
later
it
was
used
as
a
meeting
hall
.

After
extensive
fire
damage
,
it
was
reconstructed
into
today
's
town
hall
.

Hutton
's
mill
,
on
Rose
Valley
Road
by
Vernon
Run
,
was
built
about
0000
as
a
feed
mill
.

In
0000
it
became
a
turning
mill
.

It
was
used
to
produce
bobbin
s
for
the
nearby
textile
mill
as
well
as
serving
as
a
warehouse
.

Later
it
produced
sandpaper
.

Will
Price
also
reconstructed
this
mill
into
a
meeting
house
and
theater
.

It
also
suffered
fire
damage
,
was
again
reconstructed
,
and
now
houses
the
Hedgerow
Theatre
.

Arts
and
crafts
project
Under
the
leadership
of
Will
Price
,
the
Rose
Valley
Association
was
formed
in
July
0000
to
start
an
arts
and
crafts
project
and
buy
about
00
acres
of
land
,
an
area
that
is
the
nucleus
of
today
's
borough
.

Investors
contributed
about
$
00,000
in
capital
including
$
0,000
borrowed
from
nearby
Swarthmore
College
to
buy
and
improve
the
land
.

Price
's
vision
may
have
been
modelled
on
the
utopian
socialist
society
described
in
News
from
Nowhere
by
William
Morris
.

Price
's
liberal
views
led
to
some
misconceptions
about
the
project
according
to
his
niece
,
Eleanore
Price
Mather
:
"
First
,
it
was
not
a
free
love
colony
.

Second
it
was
not
single
tax
....
And
third
,
it
was
not
communistic
.

Rose
Valley
was
essentially
an
arts
and
crafts
project
.
"

Price
had
led
a
discussion
group
,
including
Edward
Bok
and
brothers
Samuel
and
Joseph
Fels
,
and
many
in
this
group
became
investors
or
residents
in
Rose
Valley
.

Other
early
residents
included
Hawley
McLanahan
,
who
became
Price
's
architectural
partner
,
McLanahan
's
father-in-law
,
Charles
T.
Schoen
,
Price
's
employees
at
his
architectural
firm
,
and
his
relatives
,
including
his
brother
Walter
,
also
an
architect
.

Feminist
Anna
Howard
Shaw
lived
nearby
.

Administration
of
the
project
was
in
the
form
of
a
town
meeting
,
called
the
"
Folk
Mote
.
"

The
Rose
Valley
Association
did
not
produce
arts
and
crafts
itself
,
but
rather
rented
out
working
space
to
craftsmen
,
and
provided
them
housing
,
generally
designed
or
renovated
by
Price
.

The
crafts
were
sold
from
Price
's
office
at
0000
Walnut
Street
in
Philadelphia
.

Furniture
,
as
well
as
ceramics
and
book
binding
,
were
produced
at
the
Old
Mill
until
about
0000
.

A
journal
,
The
Artsman
was
published
from
0000-0000
.

An
art
gallery
was
located
in
the
old
bobbin
mill
,
then
called
Artsman
's
Hall
,
and
,
starting
in
0000
,
run
by
well-known
artist
Alice
Barber
Stephens
,
who
lived
in
the
mill
until
a
nearby
barn
was
converted
by
Price
into
her
house
,
Thunderbird
Lodge
.

Artsman
's
Hall
was
also
used
for
theater
,
with
the
first
play
"
The
Carpet
Bagger
's
Revenge
"
presented
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
0000
.

Eventually
the
building
became
used
solely
by
the
Hedgerow
Theater
,
which
is
still
an
active
theater
.

By
0000
,
however
,
craft
production
had
faded
and
the
community
had
become
essentially
a
commuter
suburb
of
Philadelphia
,
using
the
nearby
Moylan-Rose
Valley
Station
.

The
buildings
designed
or
renovated
by
Price
during
this
period
may
be
Rose
Valley
's
major
achievement
.

According
to
George
E.
Thomas
,
"
Rose
Valley
is
of
exceptional
importance
,
a
major
American
architectural
landmark
.
"

After
0000
Schoen
,
McLanahan
,
and
Price
bought
the
remaining
land
from
the
Rose
Valley
Association
,
and
Price
designed
the
"
Rose
Valley
Improvement
Company
Houses
"
near
the
old
bobbin
mill
.

As
a
group
,
these
are
the
most
important
group
of
houses
designed
,
rather
than
renovated
,
by
Price
in
Rose
Valley
.

In
0000
a
Pennsylvania
State
historic
marker
was
installed
on
Rose
Valley
Road
to
the
south
of
Thunderbird
Lodge
.

It
commemorates
the
Great
Minquas
Path
,
a
Native
American
trail
that
ran
nearby
.

It
features
a
sculpture
of
a
beaver
by
Albert
Laessle
.

Rutledge
is
a
borough
in
Delaware
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

In
the
borough
is
a
children
's
park
named
Triangle
Park
along
with
a
Fire
Department
.

Students
living
in
Rutledge
attend
school
in
the
Wallingford-Swarthmore
School
District
.

History
Rutledge
was
founded
in
0000
by
a
group
of
Philadelphia
businessmen
,
and
incorporated
as
a
Borough
in
0000
.

Here
is
how
the
community
was
described
in
an
0000
promotional
brochure
:
“
Located
ten
miles
from
Philadelphia
,
on
the
line
of
the
Central
Division
of
the
Philadelphia
,
Wilmington
and
Baltimore
Railroad
,
three
minutes
walk
from
Morton
Station
–
it
is
reached
in
from
00
to
00
minutes
by
00
trains
daily
…
To
the
west
lies
the
magnificent
Swarthmore
College
,
and
to
the
southeast
,
three
miles
away
,
lies
the
Delaware
River
…
its
school
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
county
;
its
houses
are
neat
and
attractive
,
and
their
owners
take
great
pride
in
their
homes
and
the
adornment
of
their
grounds
.

”
Since
then
,
there
have
been
a
few
name
changes
.

The
train
line
is
SEPTA
’s
Media/Elwyn
Line
,
which
provides
00
trains
on
weekdays
from
Philadelphia
to
what
is
now
called
the
Morton-Rutledge
Station
.

But
in
many
ways
,
this
description
still
holds
true
today
.

The
schools
in
the
Wallingford-Swarthmore
School
District
are
still
among
the
finest
in
the
county
,
and
the
homes
,
many
of
them
dating
back
to
the
late
00th
century
,
are
still
kept
with
pride
by
their
owners
.

There
is
a
long-standing
legend
that
the
Borough
was
named
after
Ann
Rutledge
,
a
sweetheart
of
Abraham
Lincoln
.

This
erroneous
story
is
perpetuated
in
the
sign
that
greets
you
as
you
approach
Rutledge
from
the
south
on
Morton
Avenue
.

The
actual
story
,
according
to
the
founders
’
brochure
,
is
that
the
town
was
named
after
a
then-popular
romantic
novel
written
in
the
0000s
.

However
,
the
site
of
what
is
now
Rutledge
Borough
was
once
a
section
of
land
on
the
estate
of
Edward
Rutledge
,
who
served
as
Representative
from
South
Carolina
at
the
Constitutional
Convention
of
July
0
,
0000
in
Philadelphia
and
was
the
youngest
signer
of
the
United
States
Declaration
of
Independence
.

The
person
who
first
suggested
the
name
may
also
have
known
of
this
connection
.

History
First
settled
before
the
year
0000
by
Quakers
who
arrived
in
Pennsylvania
with
William
Penn
,
Springfield
was
first
recognized
as
a
governmental
entity
in
0000
.

The
names
of
many
of
the
streets
in
Springfield
are
named
after
former
prominent
citizens
,
including
Powell
,
Kennerly
,
Lownes
,
Thomas
,
Levis
,
Foulke
,
Evans
,
Pancoast
,
Worrell
,
and
Edge
.

After
its
founding
,
Springfield
was
primarily
a
farming
town
.

On
December
0
,
0000
the
settlers
began
laying
the
road
to
Amosland
as
it
was
then
called
.

This
road
is
now
known
as
Springfield
Road
.

In
0000
construction
began
on
the
Baltimore
Pike
;
the
road
was
formed
of
sturdy
oak
planks
,
some
of
which
still
exist
under
the
current
Baltimore
Pike
.

0000
also
marked
the
year
that
construction
began
on
the
first
Quaker
meeting
house
.

The
meeting
house
burned
down
in
0000
and
was
rebuilt
.

The
current
meeting
house
that
stands
in
its
spot
today
was
constructed
in
0000
.

By
the
date
of
the
signing
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
in
0000
it
is
estimated
from
tax
records
that
about
000
people
resided
in
Springfield
.

By
the
00th
century
Springfield
had
become
more
industrialized
.

Taking
advantage
of
its
many
creeks
,
the
inhabitants
erected
many
mills
.

However
,
the
town
was
still
primarily
a
farming
town
.

At
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
Springfield
's
Baltimore
Pike
had
become
one
of
the
busiest
commercial
areas
outside
of
Philadelphia
.

The
strip
of
Baltimore
Pike
in
Springfield
became
known
as
"
The
Golden
Mile
"
.

The
Golden
Mile
is
a
unique
corridor
that
is
essentially
a
compact
commercial
strip
that
cuts
directly
through
an
established
residential
area
on
both
sides
.

Lifelong
residents
of
the
community
are
currently
pushing
to
improve
the
cluttered
and
dangerous
Golden
Mile
,
through
the
implementation
of
green
initiatives
,
responsible
traffic
planning
,
and
zoning
improvements
.

In
the
past
century
,
all
of
Springfield
's
farmland
was
slowly
bought
up
by
developers
who
turned
Springfield
into
the
town
it
is
today
,
that
is
,
largely
comprising
developments
of
standard
suburban
single-family
homes
.

One
of
the
largest
single
developments
was
the
Stoney
Creek
development
.

Construction
began
in
0000
and
was
completed
in
only
0
years
.

The
huge
development
stretched
from
West
Avenue
to
Providence
Road
and
ran
all
the
way
up
to
Baltimore
Pike
.

Over
00
homes
were
constructed
in
the
development
.

Unlike
most
housing
developments
of
their
time
,
no
two
houses
in
Stoney
Creek
were
built
exactly
the
same
.

While
all
resemble
each
other
with
their
stone
fronts
and
common
size
,
slight
variations
such
as
porches
and
window
placement
differed
on
each
house
,
making
each
one
slightly
different
.

Though
all
of
the
farmland
of
Springfield
's
past
is
gone
,
many
of
the
woods
and
fields
of
the
past
still
remain
standing
today
in
some
of
the
many
parks
located
throughout
the
community
.

Currently
,
the
bulk
of
Springfield
's
history
lies
recorded
in
the
archives
of
the
Heritage
Society
of
Springfield
,
and
the
Springfield
Township
Public
Library
(
a
member
of
the
Delaware
County
Library
System
)
.

Economy
The
township
is
home
to
Springfield
Mall
,
a
,
two-level
shopping
mall
.

One
of
the
first
several
suburban
locations
of
Strawbridge
&
Clothier
was
located
in
Springfield
.

The
old
Strawbridge
&
Clothier
has
been
reconstructed
into
a
Target
.

Swarthmore
is
a
borough
in
Delaware
County
,

the
town
.

The
name
was
changed

.
"

Swarthmore
"
can
be

History
Thornbury
Township
lies
in
the
river
and
bay
drainage
area
named
"
Delaware
"
in
honor
of
Thomas
West
,
0rd
Baron
De
La
Warr
,
Governor
of
the
nearby
English
colony
of
Virginia
.

The
land
was
"
discovered
"
and
explored
by
Henry
Hudson
in
0000
,
and
over
the
next
several
decades
it
was
variously
claimed
by
the
Swedes
,
the
Dutch
,
and
the
English
.

Its
original
human
inhabitants
were
the
Lenni-Lenape
tribe
of
American
Indians
.

Once
the
Dutch
were
defeated
,
King
Charles
II
of
England
made
his
grant
to
William
Penn
in
order
to
found
the
colony
which
came
to
be
named
Pennsylvania
.

The
land
within
the
present
boundaries
of
Thornbury
Township
was
taken
up
by
"
first
purchasers
"
from
William
Penn.
.

The
original
grant
documents
were
copper-plate
prints
on
parchment
;
some
still
survive
and
show
a
price
of
000
English
pounds
for
0,000
acres
(
a
little
over
0,000
hectares
)
.

The
Court
of
Equity
in
Chester
recognized
a
separate
Thornbury
Township
in
0000
,
and
appointed
township
officers
.

At
the
time
,
the
area
was
only
in
Chester
County
,
one
of
the
original
counties
chartered
by
William
Penn
;
Delaware
County
had
not
yet
been
formed
.

Thornbury
was
named
after
the
English
birthplace
of
the
wife
of
George
Pearce
,
who
in
0000
had
been
granted
title
to
000
acres
(
000
hectares
)
in
the
Township
.

The
Battle
of
the
Brandywine
,
the
only
major
battle
of
the
American
Revolution
fought
in
Pennsylvania
,
was
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
western
part
of
the
township
;
follow-up
military
operations
took
place
in
the
township
(
see
below
)
.

In
0000
,
the
Pennsylvania
Assembly
authorized
the
division
of
Chester
County
and
the
creation
of
Delaware
County
.

In
plotting
the
boundary
between
the
two
,
Thornbury
Township
was
divided
.

Border
landowners
were
asked
if
they
wished
to
remain
in
Chester
County
or
be
in
Delaware
County
.

The
line
thus
drawn
was
quite
irregular
,
and
as
a
result
,
the
northern
boundary
of
the
Delaware
County
township
(
like
the
southern
boundary
of
its
Chester
County
counterpart
)
is
distinctly
jagged
(
see
map
)
.

Thornbury
Township
was
enlarged
by
annexing
the
northern
portion
of
Aston
Township
in
0000
;
that
township
was
dissolved
.

The
boundaries
of
Thornbury
have
remained
unchanged
since
.

The
township
is
the
location
of
"
Thornbury
"
house
,
home
of
Revolutionary
War
figure
Persifor
Frazer
.

After
the
Battle
of
the
Brandywine
,
his
wife
Mary
stood
down
a
British
raiding
party
in
a
celebrated
incident
.

The
house
and
barn
survived
the
war
,
but
are
now
in
ruins
.

History
The

Swedish
colony
of
New
Sweden
.

They
arrived
in
the
area
in
0000
and
built
a
permanent
settlement
at
Tinicum
Island
.

Although
the
name
literally
means
"
up
land
"
,
it
also
reflects
the
Swedish
province
of
Uppland
.

The
settlement
of
Upland
was
built
around
the
point
where
the
Chester
Creek
flows
into
the
Delaware
River
,
which
is
part
of
the
city
of
Chester
(
formerly
also
called
"
Upland
"
)
.

The
colonists
had
plantations
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
for
export
to
Sweden
.

Upland
was
reflected
on
the
early
map
of
New
Sweden
made
by
Peter
Lindstrom
in

governments
were

for
colonial
supremacy
in

mid-Atlantic
coastal
area
:
the
Dutch
,
the
Swedish
and
the
English
.

The
Swedish
settlement
was
incorporated
into
Dutch
New
Netherland
on
September
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
English
captured
New
Netherlands
from
the
Dutch
.

In
0000
,
the
Duke
of
York
's
laws
were
promulgated
as
the
rule
of
conduct
on
the
Delaware
River
,
and
courts
were
established
,
one
of
which
was
the

History
Upper
Chichester
Township
was
originally
part
of
the
section
of
Chester
County
called
Chichester
.

Chichester
comprised
the
area
now
known
as
Upper
and
Lower
Chichester
.

Among
the
earliest
settlers
of
the
township
was
Walter
Martin
,
the
founder
of
St.
Martin
's
Church
,
in
the
late
00th
century
.

The
road
from
Chichester
to
Aston
traversing
the
township
almost
due
north
,
was
laid
out
0000
,
while
the
Upper
Chichester
road
was
laid
out
on
Oct.
00
,
0000
.

At
the
southwestern
limit
of
the
territory
was
a
tract
of
two
hundred
and
,
which
was
located
Sept.
0/0
,
0000
.

The
"
The
Twelve-Mile
Circle
"
(
the
circular
northern
boundary
line
of
the
State
of
Delaware
)
traverses
this
tract
.

The
division
of
Chichester
into
Upper
and
Lower
Chichester
was
made
early
in
0000
to
facilitate
public
business
.

In
0000
,
an
effort
was
made
to
have
the
division
which
had
been
made
officially
recognized
.

The
movement
was
,
however
,
met
by
sturdy
opposition
from
the
leading
citizens
and
land-owners
of
Lower
Chichester
,
stating
that
the
townships
as
they
currently
stood
were
convenient
enough
and
did
not
need
any
separation
.

They
further
argued
that
recent
work
to
mend
the
highways
in
Lower
Chichester
,
and
the
need
to
provide
for
several
poor
in
the
Township
were
more
important
uses
of
funds
than
the
cost
of
the
survey
.

The
matter
was
permitted
to
drag
along
for
six
years
,
during
which
time
the
reasons
for
the
official
recognition
of
the
separation
of
the
two
townships
became
apparent
to
all
.

Hence
in
August
0000
,
a
petition
to
formally
separate
the
two
townships
was
presented
,
bearing
the
signatures
of
almost
every
freeholder
in
Upper
and
Lower
Chichester
as
well
as
those
in
Nether
Providence
.

History
Early
settlement
The
area
was
first
settled
in
the
late
0000
by
a
group
from
New
Sweden
.

The
Township
was
founded
during
a
split
from
Darby
Township
on
August
00
,
0000
.

However
it
was
not
incorporated
under
a
new
rule
the
Nawab
of
Upper
Darby
.

The
abundance
of
creeks
and
streams
in
the
area
favored
the
development
of
mills
and
it
was
in
Upper
Darby
that
the
first
mills
in
Delaware
County
could
be
found
.

The
mill
trade
greatly
increased
the
population
of
Upper
Darby
,
from
just
over
000
in
0000
to
almost
0000
by
0000
.

to

Paper
mill
The
major
industry
in
Johnsonburg
is
paper
,
with
the
largest
mill
owned
by
the
Domtar
Corporation
.

It
was
built
more
than
a
century
ago
,
originally
owned
by
Curtis
Publishing
Company
,
publisher
of
the
Saturday
Evening
Post
.

By
0000
,
it
was
believed
to
be
the
largest
coated
paper
mill
in
the
world
.

By
the
0000s
,
Curtis
Publishing
was
questioning
its
ownership
of
the
mill
due
to
financial
concerns
,
and
by
0000
,
had
closed
down
the
Johnsonburg
mill
.

Six
months
later
,
a
group
of
investors
,
including
industrialist
George
S.
Petty
,
formed
a
group
called
Penntech
Papers
,
purchased
the
mill
assets
,
and
continued
it
in
operation
for
the
next
00
years
.

In
0000
,
Penntech
sold
the
mill
to
Willamette
Industries
,
the
company
that
would
later
be
acquired
by
Weyerhaeuser
in
February
0000
in
a
hostile
takeover
and
then
in
0000
was
acquired
by
Domtar

Isidore
Auguste
Marie
François
Xavier
Comte
(
00
January
0000
–
0
September
0000
)
,
better
known
as
Auguste
Comte
(
)
,
was
a
French
philosopher
.

He
was
a
founder
of
the
discipline
of
sociology
and
of
the
doctrine
of
positivism
.

He
is
sometimes
regarded
as
the
first
philosopher
of
science
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term
.

Strongly
influenced
by
the
utopian
socialist
Henri
Saint-Simon
,
Comte
developed
the
positive
philosophy
in
an
attempt
to
remedy
the
social
malaise
of
the
French
Revolution
,
calling
for
a
new
social
doctrine
based
on
the
sciences
.

Comte
was
a
major
influence
on
00th-century
thought
,
influencing
the
work
of
social
thinkers
such
as
Karl
Marx
,
John
Stuart
Mill
,
and
George
Eliot
.

His
concept
of
sociologie
and
social
evolutionism
,
though
now
outdated
,
set
the
tone
for
early
social
theorist
s
and
anthropologist
s
such
as
Harriet
Martineau
and
Herbert
Spencer
,
evolving
into
modern
academic
sociology
presented
by
Émile
Durkheim
as
practical
and
objective
social
research
.

Comte
's
social
theories
culminated
in
the
"
Religion
of
Humanity
"
,
which
influenced
the
development
of
religious
humanist
and
secular
humanist
organizations
in
the
00th
century
.

Comte
likewise
coined
the
word
altruisme
(
altruism
)
.

Life
Comte
was
born
in
Montpellier
,
Hérault
,
in
southern
France
on
00
January
0000
.

After
attending
the
Lycée
Joffre
and
then
the
University
of
Montpellier
,
Comte
was
admitted
to
the
École
Polytechnique
in
Paris
.

The
École
Polytechnique
was
notable
for
its
adherence
to
the
French
ideals
of
republicanism
and
progress
.

The
École
closed
in
0000
for
reorganization
,
however
,
and
Comte
continued
his
studies
at
the
medical
school
at
Montpellier
.

When
the
École
Polytechnique
reopened
,
he
did
not
request
readmission
.

Following
his
return
to
Montpellier
,
Comte
soon
came
to
see
unbridgeable
differences
with
his
Catholic
and
monarchist
family
and
set
off
again
for
Paris
,
earning
money
by
small
jobs
.

In
August
0000
,
he
became
a
student
and
secretary
to
Claude
Henri
de
Rouvroy
,
Comte
de
Saint-Simon
,
who
brought
Comte
into
contact
with
intellectual
society
and
greatly
influenced
his
thought
therefrom
.

During
that
time
Comte
published
his
first
essays
in
the
various
publications
headed
by
Saint-Simon
,
L'Industrie
,
Le
Politique
,
and
L'Organisateur
(
Charles
Dunoyer
and
Charles
Comte
's
Le
Censeur
Européen
)
,
although
he
would
not
publish
under
his
own
name
until
0000
's
"
La
séparation
générale
entre
les
opinions
et
les
désirs
"
(
"
The
general
separation
of
opinions
and
desires
"
)
.

In
0000
,
Comte
left
Saint-Simon
,
again
because
of
unbridgeable
differences
.

Comte
published
a
Plan
de
travaux
scientifiques
nécessaires
pour
réorganiser
la
société
(
0000
)
(
Plan
of
scientific
studies
necessary
for
the
reorganization
of
society
)
.

But
he
failed
to
get
an
academic
post
.

His
day-to-day
life
depended
on
sponsors
and
financial
help
from
friends
.

Debates
rage
as
to
how
much
Comte
appropriated
the
work
of
Saint-Simon
.

Comte
married
Caroline
Massin
,
but
divorced
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
he
was
taken
to
a
mental
health
hospital
,
but
left
without
being
cured
–
only
stabilized
by
French
alienist
Jean-Étienne
Dominique
Esquirol
–
so
that
he
could
work
again
on
his
plan
(
he
would
later
attempt
suicide
in
0000
by
jumping
off
the
Pont
des
Arts
)
.

In
the
time
between
this
and
their
divorce
,
he
published
the
six
volumes
of
his
Cours
.

Comte
developed
a
close
friendship
with
John
Stuart
Mill
.

From
0000
,
he
had
a
platonic
relationship
with
Clotilde
de
Vaux
.

After
her
death
in
0000
this
love
became
quasi-religious
,
and
Comte
,
working
closely
with
Mill
(
who
was
refining
his
own
such
system
)
developed
a
new
"
Religion
of
Humanity
"
.

John
Kells
Ingram
,
an
adherent
of
Comte
,
visited
him
in
Paris
in
0000
.

He
published
four
volumes
of
Système
de
politique
positive
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

His
final
work
,
the
first
volume
of
"
La
Synthèse
Subjective
"
(
"
The
Subjective
Synthesis
"
)
,
was
published
in
0000
.

Comte
died
in
Paris
on
0
September
0000
from
stomach
cancer
and
was
buried
in
the
famous
Père
Lachaise
Cemetery
,
surrounded
by
cenotaphs
in
memory
of
his
mother
,
Rosalie
Boyer
,
and
of
Clotilde
de
Vaux
.

His
apartment
from
0000
–
0000
is
now
conserved
as
the
Maison
d'Auguste
Comte
and
is
located
at
00
rue
Monsieur-le-Prince
,
in
Paris
'
0th
arrondissement
.

Thought
Comte
's
positivism
Comte
first
described
the
epistemological
perspective
of
positivism
in
The
Course
in
Positive
Philosophy
,
a
series
of
texts
published
between
0000
and
0000
.

These
texts
were
followed
by
the
0000
work
,
A
General
View
of
Positivism
(
published
in
English
in
0000
)
.

The
first
three
volumes
of
the
Course
dealt
chiefly
with
the
physical
sciences
already
in
existence
(
mathematics
,
astronomy
,
physics
,
chemistry
,
biology
)
,
whereas
the
latter
two
emphasised
the
inevitable
coming
of
social
science
.

Observing
the
circular
dependence
of
theory
and
observation
in
science
,
and
classifying
the
sciences
in
this
way
,
Comte
may
be
regarded
as
the
first
philosopher
of
science
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term
.

Comte
was
also
the
first
to
distinguish
natural
philosophy
from
science
explicitly
.

For
him
,
the
physical
sciences
had
necessarily
to
arrive
first
,
before
humanity
could
adequately
channel
its
efforts
into
the
most
challenging
and
complex
"
Queen
science
"
of
human
society
itself
.

His
View
of
Positivism
would
therefore
set
out
to
define
,
in
more
detail
,
the
empirical
goals
of
sociological
method
.

Comte
offered
an
account
of
social
evolution
,
proposing
that
society
undergoes
three
phases
in
its
quest
for
the
truth
according
to
a
general
'
law
of
three
stages
'
.

The
idea
bears
some
similarity
to
Marx
's
view
that
human
society
would
progress
toward
a
communist
peak
.

This
is
perhaps
unsurprising
as
both
were
profoundly
influenced
by
the
early
Utopian
socialist
,
Henri
de
Saint-Simon
,
who
was
at
one
time
Comte
's
teacher
and
mentor
.

Both
Comte
and
Marx
intended
to
develop
,
scientifically
,
a
new
secular
ideology
in
the
wake
of
European
secularisation
.

Comte
's
stages
were
(
0
)
the
theological
,
(
0
)
the
metaphysical
,
and
(
0
)
the
positive
.

The
Theological
phase
was
seen
from
the
perspective
of
00th
century
France
as
preceding
the
Enlightenment
,
in
which
man
's
place
in
society
and
society
's
restrictions
upon
man
were
referenced
to
God
.

Man
blindly
believed
in
whatever
he
was
taught
by
his
ancestors
.

He
believed
in
a
supernatural
power
.

Fetishism
played
a
significant
role
during
this
time
.

By
the
"
Metaphysical
"
phase
,
he
referred
not
to
the
Metaphysics
of
Aristotle
or
other
ancient
Greek
philosophers
.

Rather
,
the
idea
was
rooted
in
the
problems
of
French
society
subsequent
to
the
revolution
of
0000
.

This
Metaphysical
phase
involved
the
justification
of
universal
rights
as
being
on
a
vauntedly
higher
plane
than
the
authority
of
any
human
ruler
to
countermand
,
although
said
rights
were
not
referenced
to
the
sacred
beyond
mere
metaphor
.

This
stage
is
known
as
the
stage
of
investigation
,
because
people
started
reasoning
and
questioning
although
no
solid
evidence
was
laid
.

The
stage
of
investigation
was
the
beginning
of
a
world
that
questioned
authority
and
religion
.

In
the
Scientific
phase
,
which
came
into
being
after
the
failure
of
the
revolution
and
of
Napoleon
,
people
could
find
solutions
to
social
problems
and
bring
them
into
force
despite
the
proclamations
of
human
rights
or
prophecy
of
the
will
of
God
.

Science
started
to
answer
questions
in
full
stretch
.

In
this
regard
he
was
similar
to
Karl
Marx
and
Jeremy
Bentham
.

For
its
time
,
this
idea
of
a
Scientific
phase
was
considered
up-to-date
,
although
from
a
later
standpoint
it
is
too
derivative
of
classical
physics
and
academic
history
.

Comte
's
law
of
three
stages
was
one
of
the
first
theories
of
social
evolutionism
.

The
other
universal
law
he
called
the
"
encyclopedic
law
.
"

By
combining
these
laws
,
Comte
developed
a
systematic
and
hierarchical
classification
of
all
sciences
,
including
inorganic
physics
(
astronomy
,
earth
science
and
chemistry
)
and
organic
physics
(
biology
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
physique
sociale
,
later
renamed
sociologie
)
.

Independently
from
Emmanuel
Joseph
Sieyès
's
introduction
of
the
term
in
0000
,
Comte
re-invented
"
sociologie
"
,
and
introduced
the
term
as
a
neologism
,
in
0000
.

Comte
had
earlier
used
the
term
"
social
physics
"
,
but
that
term
had
been
appropriated
by
others
,
notably
Adolphe
Quetelet
.

This
idea
of
a
special
science
—
not
the
humanities
,
not
metaphysics
—
for
the
social
was
prominent
in
the
00th
century
and
not
unique
to
Comte
.

It
has
recently
been
discovered
that
the
term
"
sociology
"
–
a
term
considered
coined
by
Comte
–
had
already
been
introduced
in
0000
,
albeit
with
a
different
meaning
,
by
the
French
essayist
Emmanuel
Joseph
Sieyès
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

The
ambitious
—
many
would
say
grandiose
—
way
that
Comte
conceived
of
this
special
science
of
the
social
,
however
,
was
unique
.

Comte
saw
this
new
science
,
sociology
,
as
the
last
and
greatest
of
all
sciences
,
one
which
would
include
all
other
sciences
and
integrate
and
relate
their
findings
into
a
cohesive
whole
.

It
has
to
be
pointed
out
,
however
,
that
there
was
a
seventh
science
,
one
even
greater
than
sociology
.

Namely
,
Comte
considered
"
Anthropology
,
or
true
science
of
Man
[
to
be
]
the
last
gradation
in
the
Grand
Hierarchy
of
Abstract
Science
.
"

Comte
's
explanation
of
the
Positive
philosophy
introduced
the
important
relationship
between
theory
,
practice
and
human
understanding
of
the
world
.

On
page
00
of
the
0000
printing
of
Harriet
Martineau
's
translation
of
The
Positive
Philosophy
of
Auguste
Comte
,
we
see
his
observation
that
,
"
If
it
is
true
that
every
theory
must
be
based
upon
observed
facts
,
it
is
equally
true
that
facts
can
not
be
observed
without
the
guidance
of
some
theories
.

Without
such
guidance
,
our
facts
would
be
desultory
and
fruitless
;
we
could
not
retain
them
:
for
the
most
part
we
could
not
even
perceive
them
.
"

Comte
is
generally
regarded
as
the
first
Western
sociologist
(
Ibn
Khaldun
having
preceded
him
in
North
Africa
by
nearly
four
centuries
)
.

Comte
's
emphasis
on
the
interconnectedness
of
social
elements
was
a
forerunner
of
modern
functionalism
.

Nevertheless
,
as
with
many
others
of
Comte
's
time
,
certain
elements
of
his
work
are
now
viewed
as
eccentric
and
unscientific
,
and
his
grand
vision
of
sociology
as
the
centerpiece
of
all
the
sciences
has
not
come
to
fruition
.

His
emphasis
on
a
quantitative
,
mathematical
basis
for
decision-making
remains
with
us
today
.

It
is
a
foundation
of
the
modern
notion
of
Positivism
,
modern
quantitative
statistical
analysis
,
and
business
decision-making
.

His
description
of
the
continuing
cyclical
relationship
between
theory
and
practice
is
seen
in
modern
business
systems
of
Total
Quality
Management
and
Continuous
Quality
Improvement
where
advocates
describe
a
continuous
cycle
of
theory
and
practice
through
the
four-part
cycle
of
plan
,
do
,
check
,
and
act
.

Despite
his
advocacy
of
quantitative
analysis
,
Comte
saw
a
limit
in
its
ability
to
help
explain
social
phenomena
.

The
early
sociology
of
Herbert
Spencer
came
about
broadly
as
a
reaction
to
Comte
;
writing
after
various
developments
in
evolutionary
biology
,
Spencer
attempted
to
reformulate
the
discipline
in
what
we
might
now
describe
as
socially
Darwinistic
terms
.

Comte
's
fame
today
owes
in
part
to
Émile
Littré
,
who
founded
The
Positivist
Review
in
0000
.

Debates
continue
to
rage
,
however
,
as
to
how
much
Comte
appropriated
from
the
work
of
his
mentor
,
Henri
de
Saint-Simon
.

The
religion
of
humanity
In
later
a
'
religion
of
humanity
'
for
positivist
societies
in
order
to
fulfil
the
cohesive
function
once
held
by
traditional
worship
.

In
0000
,
he
proposed
a
calendar
reform
called
the
'
positivist
calendar
'
.

For
close
associate
John
Stuart
Mill
,
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
between
a
"
good
Comte
"
(
the
author
of
the
Course
in
Positive
Philosophy
)
and
a
"
bad
Comte
"
(
the
author
of
the
secular-religious
system
)
.

The
system
was
unsuccessful
but
met
with
the
publication
of
Darwin
's
On
the
Origin
of
Species
to
influence
the
proliferation
of
various
Secular
Humanist
organizations
in
the
00th
century
,
especially
through
the
work
of
secularists
such
as
George
Holyoake
and
Richard
Congreve
.

Although
Comte
's
English
followers
,
including
George
Eliot
and
Harriet
Martineau
,
for
the
most
part
rejected
the
full
gloomy
panoply
of
his
system
,
they
liked
the
idea
of
a
religion
of
humanity
and
his
injunction
to
"
vivre
pour
autrui
"
(
"
live
for
others
"
)
,
from
which
comes
the
word
"
altruism
"
.

Three
Stages
"
The
law
is
this
:
-
that
each
of
our
leading
conceptions
,
-
each
branch
of
our
knowledge
,
-
passes
successively
through
three
different
theoretical
conditions
:
the
Theological
,
or
fictitious
;
the
Metaphysical
,
or
abstract
;
and
the
Scientific
,
or
positive
.
"

-
Comte
The
development
that
recognised
as
a
three
stage
is
considered
as
a
result
of
development
of
thinking
and
accumulation
of
philosophical
achievements
,
by
M.
I.
Sanduk
.

The
enormous
accumulations
of
achievements
of
Theoretical
Physics
during
the
first
three
decades
of
the
last
century
were
behind
Gaston
Bachelard
's
declaration
of
his
new
scientific
spirit
or
a
new
a
philosophy
of
science
(
or
a
fourth
stage
)
.

That
regarding
of
a
new
philosophy
of
science
was
owing
to
the
accumulation
of
new
proposals
of
Quantum
mechanics
.

Accordingly
,
for
Sanduk
,
the
new
development
in
science
applications
led
to
philosophy
of
technology
;
so
philosophy
of
technology
may
be
the
fourth
stage
of
philosophy
.

Valencian
(
or
;
endonym
:
valencià
,
)
is
the
historical
and
official
name
for
the
Catalan
language
,
spoken
in
the
Valencian
Community
in
Spain
.

It
is
the
traditional
and
co-official
language
of
the
Valencian
Community
,
alongside
Spanish
.

Valencian
belongs
to
the
Western
group
of
Catalan
dialects
.

Under
the
Valencian
Statute
of
Autonomy
,
the
Acadèmia
Valenciana
de
la
Llengua
(
AVL
)
has
been
established
as
its
regulator
.

The
AVL
considers
Catalan
and
Valencian
to
be
simply
two
names
for
the
same
language
.

Valencian
,
like
the
closely
related
Occitan
,
has
a
long
literary
tradition
,
especially
Late
Medieval
and
Renaissance
.

One
of
the
most
outstanding
works
of
all
Catalan
and
Valencian
literature
is
the
romance
Tirant
lo
Blanch
,
written
by
the
Valencian
knight
and
poet
Joanot
Martorell
.

Official
status
The
official
status
of
Valencian
is
regulated
by
the
Spanish
Constitution
and
the
Valencian
Statute
of
Autonomy
,
together
with
the
Law
of
Use
and
Education
of
Valencian
.

The
Valencian
Statute
of
Autonomy
sets
the
legal
status
of
Valencian
,
providing
that
:
The
Law
of
Use
and
Education
of
Valencian
develops
this
frame
work
,
providing
for
implementation
of
a
bilingual
educational
system
,
and
regulating
the
use
of
Valencian
in
the
public
administration
and
judiciary
system
,
where
citizens
can
freely
use
it
when
acting
before
both
.

Distribution
and
usage
Distribution
Valencian
is
not
spoken
all
over
the
Valencian
Community
.

Roughly
a
quarter
of
its
territory
,
equivalent
to
00
%
of
the
population
(
its
inland
part
and
areas
in
the
extreme
south
as
well
)
,
is
traditionally
Castilian-speaking
only
,
whereas
Valencian
is
spoken
to
varying
degrees
elsewhere
.

Additionally
,
it
is
also
spoken
by
a
reduced
number
of
people
in
Carche
,
a
rural
area
in
the
Region
of
Murcia
adjoining
the
Valencian
Community
;
nevertheless
Valencian
does
not
have
any
official
recognition
in
this
area
.

Knowledge
and
usage
In
0000
the
Generalitat
Valenciana
(
Servei
d’Investigació
i
Estudis
Sociolingüístics
)
published
a
study
titled
Knowledge
and
Social
use
of
Valencian
.

According
to
the
study
,
which
sampled
more
than
0,000
people
in
the
provinces
of
Castellón
,
Valencia
,
and
Alicante
:
The
survey
shows
that
,
although
Valencian
is
still
the
common
language
in
many
areas
in
the
Land
of
Valencia
,
where
slightly
more
than
half
of
the
Valencian
population
are
able
to
speak
it
,
most
Valencians
do
not
usually
speak
in
Valencian
in
their
social
relations
.

The
statistics
hide
the
fact
that
in
the
areas
where
the
language
is
still
strong
,
most
people
use
Valencian
in
preference
to
Castilian
in
all
everyday
situations
.

Moreover
,
according
to
a
survey
in
0000
,
there
is
a
downward
trend
in
everyday
Valencian
users
.

The
lowest
numbers
are
in
the
major
cities
of
Valencia
and
Alicante
,
where
the
percentage
of
everyday
speakers
is
in
single
figures
.

All
in
all
,
in
the
0000-0000
period
,
the
number
of
speakers
fell
by
00
per
cent
.

One
of
the
factors
cited
is
the
increase
in
the
numbers
of
immigrants
from
other
countries
,
who
tend
to
favour
using
Spanish
over
local
languages
;
accordingly
,
the
number
of
residents
who
claim
no
understanding
of
Valencian
sharply
increased
.

One
curiosity
in
the
heartlands
mentioned
above
,
is
that
most
of
the
children
of
immigrants
go
to
public
school
and
are
therefore
taught
in
Valencian
and
are
far
more
comfortable
speaking
this
with
their
friends
.

However
,
some
children
of
Valencian
speakers
go
to
private
schools
run
by
the
church
where
the
curriculum
is
in
Castilian
and
consequently
this
becomes
their
preferred
language
.

Valencian
subdialects
Features
of
Valencian
Note
that
this
is
a
list
of
features
of
the
main
forms
of
Valencian
as
a
group
of
dialectal
varieties
that
differ
from
those
of
other
Catalan
dialects
,
particularly
from
the
Central
variety
of
the
language
.

For
more
general
information
on
the
features
of
Valencian
,
see
Catalan
language
.

Note
also
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
variety
within
the
Valencian
Community
,
and
by
no
means
do
the
features
below
apply
to
every
local
version
.

Phonology
Vowels
Consonants
Morphology
Vocabulary
:
Some
other
features
,
such
as
the
use
of
molt
de
or
the
lack
of
hom
or
geminate
l
,
are
often
given
as
examples
of
differences
between
Valencian
varieties
and
other
forms
of
the
language
.

However
,
these
are
actually
differences
between
colloquial
and
literary
language
and
,
again
,
may
not
apply
to
specific
sub-dialects
.

Northern
and
southern
variants
of
Valencian
share
more
features
with
western
Catalan
(
Lower
Ebro
river
area
for
instance
)
than
with
central
Valencian
.

Thus
,
some
of
the
features
listed
previously
do
not
apply
to
them
.

controversy

The

History
The
six
nations
of
the
Iroquois
Confederacy
,
which
included
the
Senecas
,
originally
occupied
the
lands
in
what
is
now
Erie
.

Europeans
first
arrived
in
the
region
when
the
French
constructed
Fort
Presque
Isle
near
present-day
Erie
in
0000
,
as
part
of
their
effort
to
defend
New
France
against
the
encroaching
British
.

The
name
of
the
fort
refers
to
that
piece
of
land
that
juts
into
Lake
Erie
,
now
called
Presque
Isle
State
Park
,
with
the
French
word
"
presque-isle
"
meaning
peninsula
(
literally
"
almost
an
island
"
)
.

When
the
fort
was
abandoned
by
the
French
in
0000
,
it
was
their
last
post
west
of
Niagara
.

The
British
occupied
the
fort
at
Presque
Isle
that
same
year
,
three
years
before
the
end
of
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

Present-day
Erie
is
situated
in
what
was
the
disputed
Erie
Triangle
,
a
triangle
of
land
that
was
claimed
by
the
states
of
New
York
,
Pennsylvania
,
Connecticut
(
as
part
of
its
Western
Reserve
)
,
and
Massachusetts
.

It
officially
became
part
of
Pennsylvania
on
March
0
,
0000
,
after
Connecticut
,
Massachusetts
and
New
York
relinquished
their
claims
to
the
federal
government
,
which
in
turn
sold
the
land
to
Pennsylvania
for
00
cents
per
acre
or
a
total
of
$
000,000.00
in
Continental
currency
.

The
Iroquois
released
the
land
to
Pennsylvania
in
January
0000
for
payments
of
$
0,000
from
Pennsylvania
and
$
0,000
from
the
federal
government
.

The
Seneca
Nation
separately
settled
land
claims
against
Pennsylvania
in
February
0000
for
the
sum
of
$
000
.

The
General
Assembly
of
Pennsylvania
commissioned
the
surveying
of
land
near
Presque
Isle
through
an
act
passed
on
April
00
,
0000
.

Andrew
Ellicott
,
who
completed
Pierre
Charles
L'Enfant
's
survey
of
Washington
,
D.C.
and
helped
resolve
the
boundary
between
Pennsylvania
and
New
York
,
arrived
to
begin
the
survey
and
lay
out
the
plan
for
the
city
in
June
0000
.

Initial
settlement
of
the
area
began
that
year
.

Lt.
Colonel
Seth
Reed
and
his
family
moved
to
the
Erie
area
from
Geneva
,
New
York
,
and
before
that
from
Uxbridge
,
Massachusetts
,
and
became
the
first
European
settlers
of
Erie
,
settling
at
what
became
known
as
"
Presque
Isle
"
.

To
wrest
control
of
the
Great
Lakes
from
the
British
during
the
War
of
0000
,
President
James
Madison
ordered
the
construction
of
a
naval
fleet
at
Erie
.

Noted
shipbuilders
Daniel
Dobbins
of
Erie
and
Noah
Brown
of
New
York
led
construction
of
four
schooner
–
rigged
gunboats
and
two
brigs
.

Commodore
Oliver
Hazard
Perry
arrived
from
Rhode
Island
and
led
the
squadron
to
success
in
the
historic
Battle
of
Lake
Erie
.

Erie
was
an
important
shipbuilding
,
fishing
,
and
railroad
hub
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

The
city
was
the
site
where
three
sets
of
track
gauge
s
met
.

While
the
delays
required
to
unload
and
load
passengers
and
cargo
were
a
problem
for
commerce
and
travel
,
they
provided
much
needed
local
jobs
in
Erie
.

When
a
national
standardized
gauge
was
proposed
,
those
jobs
,
and
the
importance
of
the
rail
hub
itself
,
were
put
in
jeopardy
.

The
citizens
of
Erie
,
led
by
the
mayor
,
set
fire
to
bridges
,
ripped
up
track
and
rioted
to
attempt
to
stop
the
standardization
in
an
event
known
as
the
Erie
Gauge
War
.

On
August
0
,
0000
,
the
Mill
Creek
flooded
downtown
Erie
when
a
culvert
,
blocked
by
debris
,
gave
out
.

A
four
block
reservoir
,
caused
by
torrential
downpours
,
had
formed
behind
it
.

The
resulting
deluge
destroyed
000
houses
and

The
Gossamer
Albatross
is
a
human-powered
aircraft
built
by
American
aeronautical
engineer
Dr.
Paul
B.
MacCready
's
company
AeroVironment
.

On
June
00
,
0000
it
completed
a
successful
crossing
of
the
English
Channel
to
win
the
second
Kremer
prize
.

Design
and
development
The
aircraft
was
designed
and
built
by
a
team
led
by
Paul
B.
MacCready
,
a
noted
US
aeronautics
engineer
,
designer
,
and
world
soaring
champion
.

Gossamer
Albatross
was
his
second
human-powered
aircraft
,
the
first
being
the
Gossamer
Condor
,
which
had
won
the
first
Kremer
prize
on
August
00
,
0000
by
completing
a
mile-long
figure-eight
course
.

The
second
Kremer
challenge
was
then
announced
as
a
flight
across
the
Channel
recalling
Louis
Blériot
's
crossing
of
0000
.

The
Albatross
was
powered
using
pedals
to
drive
a
large
two-bladed
propeller
.

On
June
00
0000
,
piloted
by
amateur
cyclist
Bryan
Allen
,
it
completed
the
00.0
km
(
00.0
mi
)
crossing
in
0
hours
and
00
minutes
,
achieving
a
top
speed
of
00
km/h
(
00
mph
)
and
an
average
altitude
of
0.0
metres
(
0
ft
)
.

The
aircraft
is
of
unusual
"
canard
"
configuration
,
using
a
large
horizontal
stabilizer
forward
of
the
wing
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
Wright
brothers
'
successful
"
Flyer
"
aircraft
.

The
Gossamer
Albatross
was
constructed
using
a
carbon
fiber
frame
,
with
the
ribs
of
the
wings
made
with
expanded
polystyrene
;
the
entire
structure
was
then
wrapped
in
a
thin
,
transparent
plastic
(
mylar
aka
PET
film
)
.

The
empty
mass
of
the
structure
was
only
00
kg
(
00
lb
)
,
although
the
gross
mass
for
the
Channel
flight
was
almost
000
kg
(
000
lb
)
.

To
maintain
the
craft
in
the
air
it
was
designed
with
very
long
tapering
wings
(
high
aspect
ratio
)
,
like
those
of
a
glider
,
allowing
the
flight
to
be
undertaken
with
a
minimum
of
power
.

In
still
air
the
required
power
was
of
the
order
of
000
W
(
0.0
horsepower
)
,
though
even
mild
turbulence
made
this
figure
rise
rapidly
.

The
Albatross
I
is

Smithsonian

;
the
back-up
plane
was
jointly
tested
as
part
of
the
NASA
Langley/Dryden
flight
research
program
in
0000
and
was
also
flown
inside
the
Houston

,
the
first
ever
controlled

The

Solar-powered
variants
A
follow-up
to
the
Albatross
was
the
solar-powered
Gossamer
Penguin
in
0000
.

The
Penguin
airframe
had
been
built
by
the
MacCready
team
as
a
third
craft
for
the
cross-channel
attempt
;
in
most
of
its
dimensions
it
was
three-quarters
the
size
of
the
Gossamer
Albatross
,
and
was
held
in
reserve
as
a
speedier
if
slightly
higher-powered
alternative
to
be
used
if
it
were
found
that
the
Channel
weather
precluded
success
by
the
slower-flying
Albatross
.

The
Penguin
was
fragile
and
not
very
airworthy
,
but
led
to
a
better
aircraft
,
the
Solar
Challenger
.

Designed
by
Paul
MacCready
,
the
Solar
Challenger
had
a
wingspan
of

meters
(

,
Pennsylvania
and
the
00th-largest
municipality
in
the
state
;
larger
than

History
Evidence
exists
of
Native
American
presence
in
Millcreek
Township
as
early
as
0000
BC
.

The
township
's
Sommerheim
Park
is
the
location
of
the
Sommerheim
Park
Archaeological
District
,
which
has
yielded
archaeological
artifacts
from
the
Archaic
and
Woodland
periods
.

One
of
the
earliest
townships
in
the
Erie
Triangle
to
be
settled
,
Millcreek
was
one
of
the
original
00
townships
of
Erie
County
.

As
families
came
they
moved
from
the
bayfront
settlement
of
Erie
they
began
to
form
small
hamlets
such
as
Federal
Hill
,
Kearsarge
,
Marvintown
,
Weigelville
,
etc.
all
to
become
part
of
Mill
Creek
Township
.

As
the
Erie
settlement
grew
,
first
into
a
borough
,
then
a
city
,
it
annexed
more
and
more
sections
of
the
township
.

After
the
east/west
roads
were
laid
out
,
taverns
began
to
sprout
about
every
mile
or
so
.

Along
the
Ridge
Road
(
U.S.
Route
00
)
,
which
was
laid
west
through
Millcreek
in
0000
,
one
of
the
few
that
remains
is
the
Nicholson
Tavern
.

Built
in
0000
,
mostly
by
Isabella
Nicholson
and
her
sons
,
it
is
still
owned
by
the
family
and
is
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.

The
Presque
Isle
Light
and
Sommerheim
Park
Archaeological
District
are
also
listed
.

A
recurving
sandspit
peninsula
,
Presque
Isle
,
connects
to
the
mainland
in
western
Millcreek
.

During
the
War
of
0000
,
Oliver
Hazard
Perry
commanded
his
fleet
in
battle
and
strategically
used
the
peninsula
's
bay
as
a
harbor
to
construct
six
out
of
nine
of
the
ships
in
his
fleet
.

In
0000
the
peninsula
was
made
a
state
park
and
was
designated
as
a
National
Natural
Landmark
by
the
National
Park
Service
.

Today
the
park
is
a
bird
sanctuary
with
over
000
different
species
identified
here
.

Just
west
of
the
entry
into
Presque
Isle
was
a
well-forested
area
known
as
Hopkins
Grove
.

The
Erie
Electric
Motor
Company
purchased
the
grove
in
0000
for
development
into
an
amusement
park
.

Today
Waldameer
is
one
of
the
oldest
amusement
parks
in
the

frontier
.

Washington
delivered
the

Brownsville
is
a
borough
in
Fayette
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
,
founded
in
0000
and
located
south
of
Pittsburgh
along
the
Monongahela
River
.

In
the
00th
century
,
the
borough
became
an
industrial
center
,
transportation
hub
,
outfitting
center
,
and
river
boat-building
powerhouse
.

It
was
a
gateway
city
for
emigrants
heading
west
to
the
Ohio
Country
,
Northwest
Territory
and
beyond
on
the
various
Emigrant
Trail
s
to
the
far
west
from
its
founding
until
well
into
the
0000s
.

Brownsville
became
a
major
center
for
building
steamboats
through
the
00th
century
,
producing
0,000
boats
by
0000
.

It
exceeded
nearby
Pittsburgh
in
population
and
economy
until
well
into
the
0000s
,
when
the
railroad
s
connected
Pittsburgh
with
Kanesville
,
Iowa
on
the
Missouri
River
in
the
Midwest
,
and
established
a
major
traffic
route
.

Being
bypassed
by
the
major
railroad
route
permanently
affected
Brownsville
's
economy
and
made
it
subsidiary
to
Pittsburgh
.

The
borough
developed
in
the
late
00th
century
as
a
railroad
yard
and
coking
center
,
with
other
industries
related
to
the
rise
of
steel
in
the
Pittsburgh
area
.

It
reached
a
peak
of
population
of
more
than
0,000
in
0000
.

Postwar
development
occurred
in
suburbs
,
as
was
typical
of
the
time
.

The
restructuring
of
the
railroad
and
steel
industries
caused
a
severe
loss
of
jobs
and
population
in
Brownsville
,
beginning
in
the
0000s
.

The
borough
has
a
population
of
0000
as
of
0000
.

History
Because
colonial
settlers
believed
that
earthwork
mounds
were
a
prehistoric
fortification
,
they
called
the
settlement
Redstone
Old
Fort
;
later
in
the
0000s
–
00s
,
it
eventually
became
known
as
Redstone
Fort
or
by
the
mid-0000s
,
Fort
Burd
named
eponymously
after
the
officer
who
commanded
the
British
fort
constructed
in
0000
.

The
fort
was
constructed
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
(
Seven
Years
'
War
)
on
the
bluff
above
the
river
near
a
prehistoric
earthwork
mound
that
was
also
the
site
of
historic
Native
American
burial
grounds
.

In
0000
,
a
force
from
the
Colony
of
Virginia
garrisoned
and
occupied
the
stockade
during
Lord
Dunmore
's
War
against
the
Mingo
and
Shawnee
peoples
.

It
commanded
the
important
strategic
river
ford
of
Nemacolin
's
Trail
,
the
western
path
to
the
summit
;
this
was
later
improved
and
called
Burd
's
Road
.

It
was
an
alternative
route
down
to
the
Monongahela
River
valley
from
Braddock
's
Road
,
which
George
Washington
helped
to
build
.

Washington
came
to
own
vast
portions
of
the
lands
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Monongahela
;
the
Pennsylvania
legislature
named
Washington
County
,
the
largest
of
the
state
,
after
him
.

Thomas
Brown
,
an
entrepreneur
,
acquired
the
western
lands
in
what
became
Fayette
County
,
Pennsylvania
around
the
end
of
the
American
Revolution
.

He
realized
the
opening
of
the
Cumberland
Gap
and
war
's
end
made
the
land
at
the
western
tip
of
Fayette
County
a
natural
springboard
for
settlers
'
traveling
to
points
west
,
such
as
Kentucky
,
Tennessee
,
and
Ohio
.

Many
travelers
used
the
Ohio
River
and
its
tributary
,
the
Monongahela
.

Eventually
the
settlement
became
known
as
Brownsville
after
him
.

In
the
0000s
,
Jacob
Bowman
bought
the
land
on
which
he
built
Nemacolin
Castle
;
he
had
a
trading
post
and
provided
services
and
supplies
to
emigrant
settlers
.

Redstone
Old
Fort
is
mentioned
in
C.
M.
Ewing
's
The
Causes
of
that
so
called
Whiskey
Insurrection
of
0000
(
0000
)
as
the
site
of
a
July
00
,
0000
,
meeting
in
"
Opposition
to
the
Whiskey
Excise
Tax
,
"
during
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
.

It
was
the
first
illegal
meeting
of
that
frontier
insurrection
.

Brownsville
was
positioned
at
the
western
end
of
the
primitive
road
network
(
Braddock
's
Road
to
Burd
's
Road
via
the
Cumberland
pass
)
that
eventually
became
known
as
the
National
Pike
,
U.S.
Route
00
.

As
an
embarkation
point
for
travelers
to
the
west
,
Redstone/Brownsville
became
a
center
in
the
00th
century
for
the
construction
of
keel-boats
.

Its
boats
were
used
even
by
those
intending
to
later
take
the
Santa
Fe
Trail
or
Oregon
Trail
,
as
floating
on
a
poleboat
by
river
to
St.
Louis
or
other
ports
on
the
Mississippi
River
was
generally
safer
,
easier
and
faster
than
overland
travel
of
the
time
.

A
large
flatboat
building
industry
developed
at
Brownsville
.

This
was
followed
by
its
rapid
entry
into
the
building
of
steamboats
:
local
craftsmen
built
the
Enterprise
in
0000
,
the
first
steamboat
powerful
enough
to
travel
down
the
Mississippi
River
to
New
Orleans
and
back
.

Earlier
boats
did
not
have
enough
power
to
go
upstream
against
the
river
's
current
.

Brownsville
developed
as
an
early
center
of
the
steamboat-building
industry
in
the
00th
century
.

The
Monongahela
converges
with
the
Ohio
River
at
Pittsburgh
and
allowed
for
quick
traveling
to
the
western
frontier
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
boatyards
produced
more
than
0,000
steamboats
.

Steamboats
were
not
thoroughly
supplanted
by
diesel
until
the
late
00th
century
.

The
first
all
cast
iron
arch
bridge
constructed
in
the
United
States
was
built
in
Brownsville
to
carry
the
National
Pike
(
at
the
time
a
wagon
road
)
across
Dunlap
's
Creek
.

See
Dunlap
's
Creek
Bridge
.

The
bridge
is
still
in
use
in
.

After
the
0000
completion
of
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
to
the
Ohio
,
outfitting
emigrant
wagon
trains
in
Brownsville
declined
in
importance
.

The
rise
of
the
steel
industry
in
the
Pittsburgh
area
led
Brownsville
to
develop
as
a
railroad
yard
and
coking
center
.

It
gradually
lost
its
diverse
mix
of
businesses
but
generally
prospered
during
the
early
00th
century
.

Brownsville
tightened
its
belt
during
the
Great
Depression
,
but
the
economy
grew
with
increased
demand
for
steel
during
World
War
II
.

In
0000
,
0,000
people
lived
in
Brownsville
.

Its
postwar
growth
led
to
the
development
of
cross-county-line
suburbs
such
as
Malden
,
Low
Hill
,
and
Denbo
Heights
,
which
were
mainly
bedroom
communities
within
commuting
distance
.

With
the
restructuring
of
the
steel
industry
and
loss
of
industrial
jobs
,
by
the
mid-0000s
Brownsville
suffered
a
severe
decline
,
along
with
much
of
the
Rust
Belt
.

By
0000
census
0000
,
the
population
was
0,000
,
as
younger
people
had
moved
away
to
areas
with
more
jobs
.

In
0000
,
Brownsville
has
a
handful
of
buildings
that
are
condemned
or
boarded
up
.

Abandoned
buildings
include
the
Union
Station
of
the
railroad
,
several
banks
,
and
other
businesses
.

The
sidewalks
around
the
town
are
still
intact
and
usable
.

Brownsville
attracted
major
entertainers
in
the
early
postwar
years
,
who
also
were
performing
in
nearby
Pittsburgh
.

According
to
Mike
Evans
in
his
book
Ray
Charles
:
The
Birth
of
Soul
(
0000
)
,
the
singer
developed
his
hit
"
What
'd
I
Say
"
as
part
of
an
after-show
jam
in
Brownsville
in
December
0000
.

Geography
Brownsville
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
situated
on
the
east
(
convex
)
side
of
a
broad
sweeping
westward
bend
in
the
northerly
flowing
Monongahela
River
at
the
westernmost
point
of
Fayette
County
.

The
river
's
action
eroded
the
steep-sided
sandstone
hills
,
creating
shelf-like
benches
and
connecting
sloped
terrain
that
gave
the
borough
lowland
areas
adjacent
to
or
otherwise
accessible
to
the
river
shores
.

Much
of
the
borough
's
residential
buildings
are
built
above
the
elevation
of
the
business
district
.

The
opposite
river
shore
of
Washington
County
is
,
uncharacteristically
for
the
region
,
shaped
even
lower
to
the
water
surface
and
is
generally
flatter
.

A
small
hamlet
called
West
Brownsville
developed
on
the
western
shore
,
with
a
current
population
of
000
.

Historically
the
area
was
a
natural
river
crossing
and
it
was
the
site
of
development
of
a
ferry
,
boat
building
and
a
bridge
to
carry
roads
.

When
the
nascent
United
States
government
appropriated
funds
for
its
first
road
building
project
,
in
0000
Brownsville
was
chosen
as
an
early
intermediate
target
destination
along
the
new
National
Road
.

Until
a
bridge
was
built
across
the
river
,
Brownsville
was
the
western
terminus
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
of
which
,
of
it
is
land
and
of
it
(
0.00
%
)
is
water
.

Lester
Ward
was
elected
Mayor
in
0000
.

Redstone
Creek
is
a
minor
local
tributary
stream
of
the
Monongahela
River
.

Its
color
came
from
the
ferrous
sandstone
that
lined
its
bed
,
as
well
as
the
sandstone
heights
near
the
Old
Forts
.

The
valley
of
Redstone
Creek
is
U-shaped
,
characteristic
of
a
glaciated
valley
.

The
Creek
was
wide
enough
for
settlers
to
use
to
build
,
dock
and
outfit
numerous
flat
boat
s
,
keel
boat
s
,
and
other
river
craft
.

Its
builders
made
thousands
of
pole
boats
that
moved
the
emigrants
who
settled
the
vast
Northwest
Territory
.

Later
Brownsville
industry
built
the
first
steamboats
on
the
inland
rivers
,
and
many
hundreds
afterwards
.

Colonists
used
the
term
"
Old
Forts
"
for
the
mounds
and
earthworks
created
by
the
prehistoric
cultures
who
were
called
mound
builders
.

Archeologists
and
anthropologists
have
since
determined
that
many
prehistoric
Native
American
cultures
in
North
America
along
the
Mississippi
River
and
its
tributaries
built
massive
earthworks
for
ceremonial
,
burial
and
religious
purposes
over
a
period
of
thousands
of
years
prior
to
European
encounter
.

For
instance
,
the
Mississippian
culture
,
reaching
a
peak
about
0000
at
Cahokia
in
present-day
Illinois
,
had
sites
throughout
the
Mississippi
and
Ohio
river
valleys
,
and
into
the
Southeast
.

History
During
the
French
and
Indian
War
,
a
British
army
commanded
by
General
Edward
Braddock
approached
Fort
Duquesne
and
crossed
the
Youghiogheny
River
at
Stewart
's
Crossing
,
which
is
situated
in
the
middle
of
what
is
now
the
City
of
Connellsville
.

Connellsville
was
officially
founded
as
a
township
in
0000
then

a
borough
on
March
0
,
0000
by
Zachariah
Connell
,
a
militia
captain
during
the
American
Revolution
.

In
February
0000
,

in
these
two
boroughs
joining
and

the
first
city
in
Fayette
County
on
May
00
,
0000
.

Due
to
the
city
’s
location
in
the
center
of
the
Connellsville
coalfield
,
coal
mining
,
coke
production
,
and
other
accompanying
industries
became
the
major
sources
of
employment
and
revenue
during
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
.

Connellsville
became
known
at
the
"
Coke
Capital
of
the
World
"
due

city
's
many
beehive
ovens

the
river
to
the
left
side
on
the
former
Pittsburgh
&
West
Virginia
railroad

.

The
Norfolk

Lake
Erie
Railroad
which
build
a
new
connection
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
to
CSX
which
severed
the
old

History
The
land
where

was
developed
had
belonged
to
the
Honorable
John
Smilie
,
who
held
multiple
public
offices
in
the
government
of
Pennsylvania
and
a
member
of
Congress
when
he
died
in
December
0000
.

The
property
remained
in
a
trust
as
a
part
of
John
’s
estate
until
his
last
child
died
in
0000
when
the
property
was
sold
.

The
‘
bottom
land
’
where
Dawson
is
situated
was
acquired
by
John
Smilie
’s
granddaughter
,
Sarah
Huston
Dawson
,
and
her
second
husband
,
George
Dawson
.

The
Smilie
farm
,
except
the
river
bottom
,
was
sold
to
Stewart
Strickler
.

The
bottom
land
was
sold
to
George
Dawson
,
who
used
it
for
purposes
of
cultivation
.

The
Pittsburgh
and
Connellsville
Railroad
was
located
through
the
tract
,
and
upon
the
opening
of
the
line
Dawson
's
Station
was
established
at
this
point
.

A
post-office
was
established
at
the
same
time
.

The
property
passed
,
in
the
division
of
the
Dawson
estate
,
to
Mrs.
Alfred
[
Elizabeth
Dawson
]
Howell
,
and
in
0000
a
town
plat
was
laid
out
and
surveyed
by
Martin
Dickson
for
Mr.
Howell
.

[
Alfred
Howell
]
caused
the
tract
to
be
duly
surveyed
and
laid
out
into
building
lots
,
and
so
conducted
his
enterprise
as
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
to
erect
a
prosperous
and
desirable
village
,
with
churches
,
public
schools
,
etc.
,
upon
what
was
before
,
and
but
for
his
business
foresight
and
energy
would
have
remained
,
merely
an
uninhabitable
portion
of
an
old
farm

.

The
population
was
00
at
the

While

has
a
tiny

it

weekend
,
who

outdoor
recreation
opportunities
at
the
surrounding
Ohiopyle
State

.

The
borough
is
served
by
the
Uniontown
Area
School

History
Native
Americans
The
first
known
group
of
people
to
inhabit
the
Ohiopyle
area
were
the
Monongahela
,
a
clan
of
the
Mound
Builders
.

These
Native
Americans
disappeared
from
the
scene
just
as
European
colonists
were
beginning
to
arrive
in
North
America
.

As
the
east
coast
was
settled
,
the
Native
Americans
who
lived
closer
to
the
Atlantic
Ocean
were
exterminated
or
forced
to
flee
to
the
west
.

Various
tribes
inhabited
the
Ohiopyle
area
at
this
time
,
preceding
their
ultimate
removal
following
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

One
of
the
few
remnants
of
American
Indian
culture
that
can
be
found
in
the
area
is
in
the
name
.
"

Ohiopyle
"
is
derived
from
the
Lenape
phrase
ahi
opihəle
which
means
'
it
turns
very
white
'
,
referring
to
the
frothy
waterfalls
.

French
and
Indian
War
The
colonial
powers
of
New
France
and
the
British
Thirteen
Colonies
fought
for
control
of
the
trading
routes
in
the
Ohio
River
Valley
in
what
was
at
the
time
the
northwestern
frontier
of
America
.

The
French
were
the
first
to
explore
the
upper
reaches
of
the
Ohio
and
Mississippi
River
valleys
.

They
built
several
forts
in
what
is
now
western
Pennsylvania
,
including
Fort
Duquesne
in
what
is
now
Pittsburgh
.

Fort
Duquesne
was
built
on
the
remains
of
Fort
Prince
George
which
the
French
had
seized
from
the
British
.

George
Washington
was
sent
by
the
colonial
governor
of
Virginia
to
try
to
retake
the
all-important
fort
at
the
confluence
of
the
Allegheny
and
Monongahela
River
s.
He
was
on
two
expeditions
that
passed
through
the
Ohiopyle
area
.

Washington
tried
to
use
the
Youghiogheny
River
as
a
means
to
reach
Fort
Duquesne
quickly
,
but
was
forced
to
abandon
the
river
passage
by
the
waterfalls
in
the
Ohiopyle
area
.

Still
Washington
pressed
on
to
the
Pittsburgh
area
.

His
troops
encountered
and
routed
a
small
party
of
French
soldiers
in
the
Battle
of
Jumonville
Glen
.

One
of
these
soldiers
escaped
to
Fort
Duquesne
.

Washington
was
forced
to
quickly
build
a
fort
to
prepare
for
the
oncoming
French
attack
.

Fort
Necessity
is
just
to
the
southwest
of
Ohiopyle
State
Park
.

The
colonial
forces
of
Washington
were
overwhelmed
by
the
French
and
their
Indian
allies
in
the
Battle
of
the
Great
Meadows
at
Fort
Necessity
.

These
battles
are
considered
the
opening
shots
of
the
French
and
Indian
War
which
would
spread
to
the
Old
World
and
become
the
Seven
Years
'
War
.

The
loss
at
Fort
Necessity
marked
Washington
's
only
military
surrender
.

The
British
ultimately
won
the
French
and
Indian
war
and
the
French
were
forced
to
leave
western
Pennsylvania
.

In
0000
King
George
III
declared
the
area
an
Indian
reserve
and
required
all
European
settlers
to
leave
.

The
settlers
refused
to
leave
,
and
King
George
bought
the
land
from
the
Iroquois
in
0000
.

The
land
was
claimed
by
both
Pennsylvania
and
Virginia
.

The
dispute
of
the
territory
lasted
through
the
American
Revolution
and
was
not
resolved
until
0000
.

Whiskey
Rebellion
The
Whiskey
Rebellion
was
a
major
test
for
the
new
government
of
the
United
States
following
the
Revolution
.

The
citizens
of
western
Pennsylvania
,
mostly
near
Washington
,
Pennsylvania
,
were
not
pleased
with
the
excise
tax
on
liquor
and
distilled
drinks
.

This
tax
had
been
proposed
by
United
States
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
Alexander
Hamilton
,
passed
by
Congress
,
and
signed
into
law
by
President
Washington
in
0000
.

The
tensions
of
the
whiskey
tax
intensified
over
the
next
three
years
and
in
0000
there
was
a
state
of
insurrection
in
the
area
.

Thirteen
thousand
militiamen
under
the
direct
command
of
George
Washington
were
sent
to
put
down
the
insurrection
.

They
passed
through
the
Ohiopyle
area
on
their
way
to
arrest
the
rebels
.

The
rebels
"
could
never
be
found
,
"
according
to
Thomas
Jefferson
,
but
the
militia
rounded
up
twenty
prisoners
,
clearly
demonstrating
Federalist
authority
in
the
national
government
.

The
men
were
imprisoned
,
where
one
died
,
while
two
were
convicted
of
treason
and
sentenced
to
death
by
hanging
.

Washington
,
however
,
pardon
ed
them
on
the
grounds
that
one
was
a
"
simpleton
"
and
the
other
"
insane
.
"

The
military
suppression
of
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
set
a
precedent
that
U.S.
citizens
who
wished
to
change
the
law
had
to
do
so
peacefully
through
constitution
al
means
;
otherwise
,
the
government
would
meet
any
threats
to
disturb
the
peace
with
force
.

Lumbering
and
tourism
The
earliest
settlers
to
the
Ohiopyle
area
were
farmer
s
,
trapper
s
and
hunter
s.
The
population
of
the
area
expanded
after
the
building
of
the
National
Road
in
0000
.

This
road
that
passed
near
Ohiopyle
increased
the
accessibility
of
the
area
and
connected
it
the
eastern
markets
.

Lumbering
became
the
dominant
industry
.

Cooperage
s
,
tanneries
,
salt
mining
and
coal
mining
were
some
of
the
smaller
industries
in
the
area
.

The
construction
of
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
and
the
Western
Maryland
Railroad
greatly
accelerated
the
progress
of
the
lumbering
operations
in
Ohiopyle
.

Both
railroads
had
stations
in
the
borough
.

Several
narrow
gauge
railroads
were
built
up
into
the
surrounding
mountains
.

These
smaller
railways
were
able
to
efficiently
transport
to
lumber
to
the
sawmill
s
and
rail
stations
of
Ohiopyle
.

The
railroads
also
brought
tourist
s
to
Ohiopyle
.

The
round
trip
ride
from
Pittsburgh
to
Ohiopyle
was
one
dollar
.

Tourists
flocked
to
the
area
to
see
the
waterfall
s
and
stay
at
the
resort
s
that
quickly
sprouted
up
along
the
Youghiogheny
River
.

The
resorts
had
boardwalk
s
,
dancing
pavilions
,
bowling
alley
s
,
fountains
,
tennis
court
s
,
and
hiking
trails
.

The
rise
of
the
automobile
brought
about
the
end
of
the
resorts
at
Ohiopyle
.

The
buildings
were
torn
down
and
the
forests
were
allowed
to
regrow
.

In

,
Ohiopyle
entered
the
current
chapter
of
tourism
.

Wilderness
Voyageurs
,
under
the
ownership
of
Lance
Martin
,
began
commercial
whitewater
rafting
on
the
Youghiogheny
River
.

This
was
the
first
commercial
whitewater
rafting
company
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
.

In

people
experienced
the
rapids
of
the
Lower

over
000,000
people
came

Perryopolis
is
a
borough
in
Fayette
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
George
Washington
purchased
here
when
land
first
became
available
.

He
visited
in
0000
and
said
,
"
as
fine
a
land
as
I
have
ever
seen
,
a
great
deal
of
rich
meadow
;
it
is
well
watered
and
has
a
valuable
mill
seat
.
"

The
mill
would
eventually
be
completed
in
0000
.

Once
the
mill
was
finished
,
it
encouraged
other
business
to
come
to
the
area
to
support
and
augment
the
business
of
the
mill
.

Washington
hoped
to
develop
the
remainder
of
Perryopolis
,
drawing
up
plans
for
the
streets
to
be
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
wagon-wheel
.

Washington
's
estate
sold
the
land
after
his
death
;
in
0000
Perryopolis
,
previously
known
as
New
Boston
,
was
officially
laid
out
using
Washington
's
plans
and
named
for
Oliver
Hazard
Perry
for
his
victory
on
Lake
Erie
during
the
War
of
0000
.

In
the
late
00th
Century
,
the
area
around
Perryopolis
was
first
mined
for
coal
.

Until
the
0000s
,
coal
industries
would
be
the
area
's
primary
economic
activitiy
,
served
by
the
Washington
Run
branch
of
the
P&LE
Railroad
that
continued
on
to
Star
Junction
,
Pennsylvania
.

However
,
Perryopolis
developed
differently
than
other
nearby
mining
towns
.

Instead
of
housing
laborers
,
Perryopolis
was
mainly
inhabited
by
foreman
and
white
collar
workers
who
were
associated
with
the
mining
industry
.

History
Popularly
known
as
Beesontown
,
"
The
Town
of
Union
"
was
founded
by
Henry
Beeson
on
July
0
,
0000
,
coincidentally
the
same
date
as
the
United
States
Declaration
of
Independence
.

The
National
Road
,
also
known
as
the
Cumberland
Road
,
was
routed
through
Uniontown
in
the
early
00th
century
,
and
the
town
grew
along
with
the
road
(
now
US
00
)
.

Within
00
miles
of
Uniontown
is
Fort
Necessity
,
built
by
George
Washington
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
(
part
of
the
international
Seven
Years
War
)
.

Uniontown
's
role
in
the
Underground
Railroad
in
the
antebellum
years
is
commemorated
by
a
marker
on
the
corner
of
East
Main
Street
and
Baker
Alley
.

Residents
helped
slaves
escaping
from
the
South
to
freedom
.

In
the
late
nineteenth
century
,
the
town
grew
based
on
the
development
of
coal
mines
and
the
steel
industry
.

Uniontown
was
the
site
of
violent
clashes
between
striking
coal
miners
and
guards
at
the
local
coke
works
during
the
Bituminous
Coal
Miners
'
Strike
of
0000
.

Fifteen
guards
armed
with
carbines
and
machine
guns
held
off
an
attack
by
0000
strikers
,
killing
five
and
wounding
eight
.

The
Columbia
Rolling
Mill
,
an
iron
and
steel
works
,
was
located
in
Uniontown
from
0000
to
0000
.

The
mill
was
the
town
's
top
industry
at
that
time
.

During
the
Coal
Boom
of
the
early
part
of
the
00th
century
,
Uniontown
was
home
to
at
least
00
millionaires
,
the
most
(
per

)
of
any
city
in
the
United

.

sponsored
the

Uniontown
Speedway
board
track
from
0000
to
0000
.

It
was
a
mile
and
a
quarter
raceway
.

As
with
most
of
Western
Pennsylvania
,
Uniontown
's
economy
waned
during
the
region
's
deindustrialization
of
the
late
00th
century
,
when
the
steel
industry
restructured
and
many
jobs
went
elsewhere
,
including
offshore
.

This
decline
continued
into
the
00st
century
,
and
the
population
is
about
half
its
peak
of
0000
.

the
Big
Mac
Museum
was
opened
in
North
Huntingdon
,
Pennsylvania
to
the
disappointment
of
some
Uniontown
residents
.

According
to
a
McDonald
’s
spokesperson
the
decision
was
based
on
logistics
and
access
,
but
it
still
did
not
sit
well
with
some
residents
and
an
article
was
published
in

History
A
significant
part
of
the
prehistory
of
Washington
Township
is
the
Locus
0
Site
,
located
north
of
Fayette
City
,
where
it
is
believed
that
members
of
the
Monongahela
tribe
may
have
lived
as
far
back
as
AD
000
.

Washington
Township
is
an
original
Fayette
County
township
,
created
from
Rostraver
Township
when
Fayette
County
was
erected
from
Westmoreland
County
in
0000
.

It
originally
included
Perry
and
Jefferson
townships
.

The
only
lands
in
Pennsylvania
personally
owned
by
George
Washington
were
within
this
township
at
the
present
day
site
of
Perryopolis
.

Washington
Township
's
most
prominent
historical
figure
is
Colonel
Edward
Cook
.

Settling
in
what
was
then
Westmoreland
County
,
he
was
granted
0,000
acres
(
00
km
²
)
and
first
built
a
small
log
cabin
and
a
small
store
.

In
0000
,
he
began
building
his
home
(
still
standing
today
)
,
the
first
stone
building
west
of
the
Allegheny
Mountains
,
including
Pittsburgh
.

Built
entirely
out
of
limestone
from
his
property
,
it
was
finished
in
0000
.

Colonel
Cook
was
among
General
Washington
's
personal
friends
and
on
two
occasions
at
least
entertained
Washington
in
the
old
stone
mansion
.

On
one
of
the
occasions
named
,
Washington
was
journeying
that
way
to
visit
his
lands
in
Washington
County
and
stopped
at
Col.
Cook
's
for
a
brief
rest
.

Cook
was
at
that
time
engaged
in
reviewing
a
body
of
militia
nearby
and
knew
nothing
of
the
arrival
of
his
distinguished
guest
.

Word
of
the
arrival
was
whispered
to
the
men
before
it
reached
the
colonel
,
and
when
he
observing
the
commotion
learned
what
was
in
the
wind
,
he
relaxed
all
discipline
and
set
off
unceremoniously
for
the
house
.

The
militiamen
followed
at
the
double-quick
and
hurrahing
enthusiastically
for
General
Washington
brought
him
to
the
porch
and
evoked
from
him
in
reply
a
good
natured
and
fatherly
speech
which
the
soldiers
cheered
to
the
echo
.

He
was
a
member
of
the
Provincial
Congress
convened
in
Carpenter
's
Hall
,
Philadelphia
,
June
00
,
0000
,
that
drafted
the
first
declaration
of
independence
presented
to
Congress
,
June
00
,
0000
,
(

"
Journal
of
Congress
,

)
;
was
a
member
of
the
State
Constitutional
Convention
that
convened
September
00
,
0000
;
was
the
first
commissioner
of
exchange
and
appointed
sub-lieutenant
of
Westmoreland
County
,
March
00
,
0000
.

January
0
,
0000
,
he
was
appointed
lieutenant
of
Westmoreland
County
to
succeed
Col.
Archibald
Lochry
,
who
had
been
captured
and
killed
while
on
an
Indian
expedition
.

This
office
gave
him
command
of
the
militia
of
the
County
and
the
management
of
its
military
fiscal
affairs
.

It
was
from
this
appointment
that
Col.
Cook
received
his
military
title
.

He
aided
in
fixing
the
boundaries
of
Fayette
County
and
was
a
member
of
the
commission
that
located
the
county
seat
.

November
00
,
0000
,
he
was
appointed
justice
of
the
peace
with
a
jurisdiction
that
reached
into
Washington
County
.

April
0
,
0000
,
he
was
appointed
president
of
the
Court
of
Common
Pleas
and
Quarter
Session
;
was
associate
judge
of
Fayette
County
in
0000
;
and
from
0000
to
0000
treasurer
of
Westmoreland
County
.

He
was
conspicuous
in
the
Whiskey
Insurrection
and
having
been
prominent
in
some
of
the
meetings
of
the
insurgents
,
his
arrest
was
ordered
but
in
the
meantime
before
any
action
could
be
taken
he
appeared
November
0
,
0000
,
before
Thomas
McKean
,
chief
justice
of
the
Supreme
Court
of
Pennsylvania
and
in
the
presence
of
William
Bradford
,
Attorney
General
of
the
United
States
,
voluntarily
entered
into
recognizance
to
the
United
States
for
his
appearance
before
the
justices
of
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
at
the
next
special
session
of
the
Circuit
Court
held
for
the
district
of
Pennsylvania
"
then
and
there
to
answer
such
charges
of
treasonable
and
seditious
practices
and
such
other
matters
of
misdemeanor
as
shall
be
alleged
against
him
in
behalf
of
the
United
States
and
that
he
will
not
depart
that
court
without
license
.
"

Having
taken
this
bold
and
honorable
course
,
he
quietly
awaited
the
result
which
was
simply
that
nothing
was
found
against
him
and
he
was
not
molested
in
person
but
some
cavalrymen
belonging
to
the
army
that
came
out
to
quell
the
insurrection
visited
his
home
and
did
considerable
damage
,
nearly
demolishing
his
distillery
,
knocking
in
the
heads
of
liquor
casks
and
spilling
a
vast
amount
of
whiskey
.

century
included
the
Iroquois
,
Lenape
and
Shawnee
.
"

Falling
Spring
"
was
first
settled
by
Benjamin
Chambers
,
a
Scots-Irish
immigrant
,
in
0000
,
who
started
a
grist
mill
and
saw
mill
by
a
then
-
high
waterfall
where
Falling
Spring
Creek
joined
Conococheague
Creek
.

The
creek
provided
power
to
the
mills
,
and
the
settlement
was
known
as
"
Falling
Spring
.
"

On
March
00
,
0000
,
Chambers
was
issued
a
"
Blunston
license
"
for
,
from
a
representative
of
the
Penn
family
,
but
European
settlement
in
the
area
was
of
questionable
legality
until
the
treaty
ending
the
French
and
Indian
War
,
because
not
all
Indian
tribes
with
land
claims
had
signed
treaties
.

The
Penn
family
encouraged
settlement
in
the
area
in
order
to
strengthen
its
case
in
a
border
dispute
with
the
Maryland
Colony
,
which
had
resulted
in
hostilities
known
as
Cresap
's
War
.

This
dispute
was
not
settled
until
0000
and
the
surveying
of
the
border
known
as
the
Mason-Dixon
line
.

Chambers
traveled
to
England
to
testify
in
support
of
Penn
's
claims
.

To
maintain
peace
with
the
Indians
,
European
settlers
were
sometimes
removed
from
the
nearby
area
.

In
May
0000
,
Benjamin
Chambers
participated
in
removing
settlers
from
nearby
Burnt
Cabins
,
which
took
its
name
from
the
incident
.

The
area
was
officially
part
of
Chester
County
,
then
Lancaster
,
and
then
Cumberland
until
it
became
part
of
the
newly
established
Franklin
County
in
0000
.

The
Great
Wagon
Road
connecting
Philadelphia
with
the
Shenandoah
Valley
passed
nearby
.

In
0000
,
it
was
completed
through
Harris
's
Ferry
,
Carlisle
,
Shippensburg
,
and
Chambersburg
to
the
Potomac
River
.

In
0000
a
local
militia
was
formed
for
protection
against
Indians
,
with
Benjamin
Chambers
being
named
colonel
.

Chambersburg
was
on
the
frontier
during
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

The
area
's
population
dropped
from
about
0,000
in
0000
at
the
start
of
the
war
to
about
000
,
with
most
settlers
not
returning
until
after
0000
when
the
peace
treaty
was
signed
.

Benjamin
Chambers
built
a
private
stone
fort
during
the
war
,
which
was
equipped
with
two
0
pounder
cannons
and
fighting
occurred
nearby
.

Because
Chambers
's
fort
was
otherwise
lightly
defended
,
the
authorities
attempted
to
remove
the
cannons
to
prevent
them
from
being
captured
by
Indians
and
used
against
other
forts
.

The
attempted
removal
was
unsuccessful
,
and
one
of
the
cannons
was
used
to
celebrate
Independence
Day
in
0000
.

The
Forbes
Road
and
other
trails
going
to
Fort
Pitt
passed
nearby
as
well
.

The
Forbes
Road
developed
into
part
of
the
main
road
connecting
Pittsburg
and
Philadelphia
,
and
much
later
into
US
00
,
and
Chambersburg
developed
as
a
transportation
hub
at
the
crossroads
of
Forbes
Road
and
the
Great
Wagon
Road
.

Fighting
continued
in
the
area
after
the
war
,
most
notably
the
Enoch
Brown
school
massacre
during
Pontiac
's
Rebellion
and
the
Black
Boys
rebellion
against
British
troops
at
Fort
Loudon
.

The
first
settlers
were
Scots-Irish
Presbyterians
and
German
Protestants
came
soon
afterward
.

Quaker
s
and
English
Protestants
,
who
made
up
a
large
proportion
of
early
Pennsylvania
settlers
,
did
not
often
move
as
far
west
as
Chambersburg
.

Blacks
lived
in
Chambersburg
almost
from
the
start
of
settlement
.

Benjamin
Chambers
owned
a
black
female
slave
sometime
before
the
French
and
Indian
War
and
twenty
slaves
were
recorded
as
taxable
property
in
0000
.

The
earliest
church
was
established
by
Scots-Irish
Presbyterian
s
in
0000
.

Chambers
gave
land
to
the
congregation
in
0000
,
requiring
only
a
single
rose
as
annual
rent
.

Later
land
was
given
to
the
First
Lutheran
Church
(
0000
)
and
Zion
Reformed
Church
(
organized
in
0000
)
under
the
same
agreement
,
and
these
churches
came
to
be
known
as
the
"
Rose
Rent
Churches
.
"

A
Catholic
community
organized
in
0000
.

The
Jewish
cemetery
dates
back
to
0000
.

The
Mt.
Moriah
First
African
Baptist
Church
dates
to
0000
.

The
town
was
first
laid
out
in
0000
,
and
lots
were
advertised
for
sale
on
July
00
in
Benjamin
Franklin
's
Pennsylvania
Gazette
0000
–
0000
In
June
0000
,
soon
after
the
Battle
of
Lexington
,
local
troops
were
raised
to
fight
the
British
in
the
American
Revolution
under
the
command
of
Benjamin
Chambers
's
eldest
son
Captain
James
Chambers
,
as
part
of
the
0st
Pennsylvania
Regiment
.

These
troops
were
among
the
first
non-New
Englanders
to
join
the
siege
of
Boston
,
arriving
on
August
0
,
0000
.

James
Chambers
fought
for
seven
years
during
the
revolution
,
reaching
the
rank
of
Colonel
of
Continental
troops
on
September
00
,
0000
.

His
two
brothers
,
William
and
Benjamin
,
Jr.
,
each
served
for
much
of
the
war
and
reached
the
rank
of
Captain
.

James
Chambers
commanded
local
troops
at
the
Battle
of
Long
Island
,
and
at
White
Plains
,
Trenton
,
Princeton
,
Brandywine
,
Germantown
and
Monmouth
.

He
was
part
of
the
rear
guard
covering
the
retreat
from
Brooklyn
,
and
was
wounded
at
the
Battle
of
Brandywine
while
facing
Hessian
troops
under
General
Knuphausen
at
Chadds
Ford
.

During
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
,
local
citizens
raised
a
liberty
pole
in
support
of
the
rebels
,
and
to
protest
conscription
of
soldiers
to
put
down
the
rebellion
.

Nevertheless
,
these
citizens
were
censured
in
a
town
meeting
and
removed
the
pole
the
next
day
.

President
George
Washington
,
while
leading
United
States
troops
against
the
rebels
,
came
through
town
on
the
way
from
Carlisle
to
Bedford
,
staying
overnight
on
October
00
,
0000
.

According
to
tradition
,
Washington
lodged
with
Dr.
Robert
Johnson
,
a
surgeon
in
the
Pennsylvania
line
during
the
Revolution
.

This
march
was
one
of
only
two
times
that
a
sitting
president
personally
commanded
the
military
in
the
field
.

(
The
other
was
after
President
James
Madison
fled
the
British
occupation
of
Washington
,
D.C.
during
the
War
of
0000
.
)

After
sending
the
troops
toward
Pittsburgh
from
Bedford
under
General
Henry
"
Light
Horse
Harry
"
Lee
,
Washington
returned
through
Chambersburg
sometime
between
October
00
–
00
.

James
Chambers
was
appointed
a
Brigadier
General
of
Militia
during
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
.

Chambersburg
was
incorporated
on
March
00
,
0000
,
and
declared
the
County
Seat
when
the
State
Assembly
established
a
formal
government
.

The
first
courthouse
was
John
Jack
's
tavern
on
the
Diamond
(
town
square
)
in
0000
,
with
a
permanent
courthouse
built
in
0000
,
and
the
first
county
jail
built
0000
.

The
"
Old
Jail
"
was
built
in
0000
,
survived
the
fire
of
0000
and
is
the
oldest
jail
building
in
Pennsylvania
.

It
was
originally
used
as
the
sheriff
's
residence
and
had
the
longest
continuous
use
of
any
jail
in
the
state
,
operating
until
0000
.

Today
the
Old
Jail
is
a
museum
and
home
to
the
Franklin
County
–
Kittochtinny
Historical
Society
.

The
county
's
gallows
still
stand
in
the
jail
's
courtyard
.

Much
of
the
town
's
growth
was
due
to
its
position
as
a
transportation
center
,
first
as
the
starting
point
on
the
Forbes
Road
to
Pittsburgh
.

The
U.S.
Congress
placed
Chambersburg
on
the
Philadelphia-Pittsburgh
postal
road
in
0000
.

The
road
was
rebuilt
as
the
Chambersburg-Bedford
Turnpike
in
0000
.

The
Cumberland
Valley
Railroad
was
built
in
0000
and
was
the
area
's
center
of
economic
activity
for
nearly
000
years
.

Until
the
completion
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
's
main
line
in
0000
,
the
fastest
route
from
Pittsburgh
to
Philadelphia
was
by
stagecoach
from
Pittsburgh
to
Chambersburg
,
and
then
by
train
to
Philadelphia
.

Civil
War
era
By
0000
,
Chambersburg
was
a
stop
on
the
Underground
Railroad
.

John
Brown
stayed
in
an
upstairs
room
at
Mary
Ritner
's
boarding
house
between
June
and
October
,
0000
while
preparing
for
his
raid
on
Harpers
Ferry
.

Several
of
his
fellow
raiders
stayed
in
the
house
as
well
,
and
four
of
them
escaped
capture
and
briefly
visited
the
house
after
the
raid
.

The
house
still
stands
at
000
East
King
Street
.

While
in
Chambersburg
Brown
posed
as
Dr.
Isaac
Smith
,
an
iron
mine
developer
,
and
bought
and
stored
weapons
under
the
guise
of
mining
equipment
.

Brown
(
using
the
name
John
Smith
)
and
John
Henry
Kagi
met
with
Frederick
Douglass
and
Shields
Green
at
an
abandoned
quarry
outside
of
town
to
discuss
the
raid
on
August
00
.

According
to
Douglass
's
account
,
Brown
described
the
planned
raid
in
detail
and
Douglass
advised
him
against
it
.

Douglass
also
provided
$
00
from
a
supporter
,
and
had
helped
Green
–
a
future
raider
–
locate
Brown
.

During
the
American
Civil
War
on
October
00
,
0000
,
Confederate
Maj.
Gen.
J.E.B.
Stuart
,
with
0000
cavalrymen
,
raided
Chambersburg
,
destroying
$
000,000
of
railroad
property
and
taking
000
guns
,
hundreds
of
horses
,
and
at
least
"
eight
young
colored
men
and
boys
.
"

They
failed
,
however
,
to
accomplish
one
of
the
main
targets
of
the
raid
:
to
burn
the
railroad
bridge
across
the
Conococheague
Creek
at
Scotland
,
five
miles
(
0
km
)
north
of
town
.

During
the
early
days
of
the
0000
Gettysburg
Campaign
,
a
Virginia
cavalry
brigade
under
Brig.
Gen.
Albert
G.
Jenkins
occupied
the
town
and
burned
several
warehouses
and
Cumberland
Valley
Railroad
structures
and
the
bridge
at
Scotland
.

From
June
00
–
00
,
0000
,
much
of
the
Army
of
Northern
Virginia
passed
through
Chambersburg
en
route
to
Carlisle
and
Gettysburg
,
and
Robert
E.
Lee
established
his
headquarters
at
a
nearby
farm
.

The
following
year
,
Chambersburg
was
invaded
for
a
third
time
,
as
cavalry
dispatched
from
the
Shenandoah
Valley
by
Jubal
Early
arrived
.

On
July
00
,
0000
,
a
large
portion
of
the
town
was
burned
down
under
orders
from
Brig.
Gen.
John
McCausland
for
failing
to
provide
a
ransom
of
$
000,000
in
US
currency
,
or
$
000,000
in
gold
.

Among
the
few
buildings
left
standing
was
the
Masonic
Temple
,
which
had
been
guarded
under
orders
by
a
Confederate
mason
.

Norland
,
the
home
of
Republican
politician
and
editor
Alexander
McClure
,
was
burned
even
though
it
was
well
north
of
the
main
fire
.

Chambersburg

soon
became
a
Union

Scotland
School
for
Veterans
'
Children
The
Scotland
School
for
Veterans
'
Children
(
SSVC
)
was
a
state
owned
school
that
offered
tuition-free
residential
education
programs
for
children
of
Pennsylvania
residents
who
are
veterans
or
are
currently
serving
in
the
U.S.
armed
forces
.

Scotland
School
had
an
original
founding
date
of
0000
.

It
was
founded
as
a
result
of
two
orphaned
children
going
door
to
door
begging
for
food
.

They
knocked
on
the
door
of
then
governor
,
Andrew
Gregg
Curtin
.

Governor
Curtin
and
his
wife
realized
there
was
a
forgotten
group
of
people
resulting
from
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
orphaned
children
of
soldiers
.

Governor
Curtin
set
up
00
schools
across
the
state
and
they
became
known
as
the
'
Soldier
's
Orphan
Schools
'
.

As
students
graduated
,
the
student
bodies
of
the
schools
began
to
decline
and
in
0000
all
of
the
schools
closed
saved
one
,
the
one
located
in
Scotland
.

The
name
was
changed
to
Scotland
School
for
Veteran
's
Children
.

The
purpose
was
then
changed
to
provide
an
education
to
any
child
of
any
veteran
,
whether
that
veteran
was
living
or
deceased
.

Because
of
this
new
purpose
and
subsequent
name
change
,
the
founding
date
of
the
school
was
changed
to
0000
.

It
was
located
about
four
miles
(
0
km
)
north
of
Chambersburg
in
the
unincorporated
village
of
Scotland
and
had
about
000
students
in
grades
0
–

.

The
school
was
established
in

as
the
Pennsylvania
Soldiers
Orphans
Industrial
School
.

Over

students
have
been
educated
at
the
school
.

The
campus
contains
about

In

,
Governor

's
state
budget
,
thereby
forcing
the
school
to
close
.

Library
Coyle
Free
Library
has
roots
going
back
to
0000
,
when
a
library
of
000
books
was
organized
by
the
local
Afternoon
Club
.

A
member
of
the
club
,
Blanche
Coyle
,
left
a
bequest
of
$
00,000
in
0000
to
construct
a
library
building
.

The
building
was
completed
in

,
located
at
the
corner
of

the
library
was
made
part
