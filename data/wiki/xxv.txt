The
TRANSIT
system
,
also
known
as
NAVSAT
(
for
Navy
Navigation
Satellite
System
)
,
was
the
first
satellite
navigation
system
to
be
used
operationally
.

The
system
was
primarily
used
by
the
U.S.
Navy
to
provide
accurate
location
information
to
its
Polaris
ballistic
missile
submarine
s
,
and
it
was
also
used
as
a
navigation
system
by
the
Navy
's
surface
ship
s
,
as
well
as
for
hydrographic
and
geodetic
surveying
.

Transit
provided
continuous
navigation
satellite
service
from
0000
,
initially
for
Polaris
submarines
and
later
for
civilian
use
as
well
.

History
The
TRANSIT
satellite
system
sponsored
by
the
Navy
and
developed
jointly
by
DARPA
and
the
Johns
Hopkins
Applied
Physics
Laboratory
,
under
the
leadership
of
Dr.
Richard
Kirschner
at
Johns
Hopkins
was
the
first
satellite
positioning
system
.

Just
days
after
the
Soviet
launch
of
Sputnik
0
,
the
first
man-made
earth-orbiting
satellite
on
October
0
,
0000
,
two
physicists
at
APL
,
William
Guier
and
George
Weiffenbach
,
found
themselves
in
discussion
about
the
microwave
signals
that
would
likely
be
emanating
from
the
satellite
.

They
were
able
to
determine
Sputnik
's
orbit
by
analyzing
the
Doppler
shift
of
its
radio
signals
during
a
single
pass
.

Frank
McClure
,
the
chairman
of
APL
's
Research
Center
,
suggested
that
if
the
satellite
's
position
were
known
and
predictable
,
the
Doppler
shift
could
be
used
to
locate
a
receiver
on
Earth
.

Development
of
the
TRANSIT
system
began
in
0000
,
and
a
prototype
satellite
,
Transit
0A
,
was
launched
in
September
0000
.

That
satellite
failed
to
reach
orbit
.

A
second
satellite
,
Transit
0B
,
was
successfully
launched
April
00
,
0000
,
by
a
Thor-Ablestar
rocket
.

The
first
successful
tests
of
the
system
were
made
in
0000
,
and
the
system
entered
Naval
service
in
0000
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
surveyors
used
Transit
to
locate
remote
benchmarks
by
averaging
dozens
of
Transit
fixes
,
producing
sub-meter
accuracy
.

In
fact
,
the
elevation
of
Mount
Everest
was
corrected
in
the
late
0000s
by
using
a
Transit
receiver
to
re-survey
a
nearby
benchmark
.

Thousands
of
warships
,
freighters
and
private
watercraft
used
Transit
from
0000
until
0000
.

Some
Soviet
warships
were
equipped
with
Motorola
NavSat
receivers
.

The
TRANSIT
system
was
made
obsolete
by
the
Global
Positioning
System
(
GPS
)
,
and
ceased
navigation
service
in
0000
.

Improvements
in
electronics
allowed
the
GPS
system
to
effectively
take
several
fixes
at
once
,
greatly
reducing
the
complexity
of
deducing
a
position
.

The
GPS
system
uses
many
more
satellites
than
were
used
with
TRANSIT
,
allowing
the
system
to
be
used
continuously
,
while
TRANSIT
provided
a
fix
only
every
hour
or
more
.

After
0000
,
the
satellites
were
kept
in
use
as
spaceborne
'
mailboxes
'
and
for
the
Navy
's
Ionospheric
Monitoring
System
.

Description
Satellites
The
satellites
(
known
as
OSCAR
or
NOVA
satellites
)
used
in
the
system
were
placed
in
low
polar
orbit
s
,
at
an
altitude
of
about
000
nautical
miles
(
0,000
km
)
,
with
an
orbital
period
of
about
000
minutes
.

A
constellation
of
five
satellites
was
required
to
provide
reasonable
global
coverage
.

While
the
system
was
operational
,
at
least
ten
satellites
–
one
spare
for
each
satellite
in
the
basic
constellation
–
were
usually
kept
in
orbit
.

Note
that
these
OSCAR
satellites
were
not
the
same
as
the
OSCAR
series
of
satellites
that
were
devoted
to
use
by
amateur
radio
operators
to
use
in
satellite
communications
.

The
orbits
of
the
TRANSIT
satellites
were
chosen
to
cover
the
entire
Earth
;
their
orbits
crossed
over
the
poles
and
were
spread
out
at
the
equator
.

Since
only
one
was
usually
visible
at
any
given
time
,
fixes
could
be
made
only
when
one
of
the
satellites
was
above
the
horizon
.

At
the
equator
this
delay
between
fixes
was
several
hours
;
at
mid-latitudes
the
delay
decreased
to
an
hour
or
two
.

For
its
intended
role
as
an
updating
system
for
SLBM
launch
,
TRANSIT
sufficed
,
since
submarines
took
periodic
fixes
to
re-set
their
inertial
guidance
system
,
but
TRANSIT
lacked
the
ability
to
provide
high-speed
,
real-time
position
measurements
.

With
later
improvements
,
the
system
provided
single-pass
accuracy
of
roughly
000
meters
,
and
also
provided
time
synchronization
to
roughly
00
microseconds
.

TRANSIT
satellites
also
broadcast
encrypted
messages
,
although
this
was
a
secondary
function
.

Determining
ground
location
The
basic
operating
principle
of
TRANSIT
is
similar
to
the
system
used
by
emergency
locator
transmitter
s
,
except
their
transmitter
is
on
the
ground
and
the
receiver
is
in
orbit
.

Details
on
the
signal
are
forwarded
directly
to
ground
stations
,
which
then
generate
a
fix
on
the
transmitter
using
a
process
similar
to
TRANSIT
.

The
TRANSIT
system
satellites
broadcast
two
UHF
carrier
signals
that
provided
precise
time
hacks
(
every
two
minutes
)
,
plus
the
satellite
's
six
orbit
elements
and
orbit
perturbation
variables
.

The
orbit
ephemeris
and
clock
corrections
were
uploaded
twice
each
day
to
each
satellite
from
one
of
the
four
Navy
tracking
and
injection
stations
.

This
broadcast
information
allowed
a
ground
receiver
to
calculate
the
location
of
the
satellite
at
any
point
in
time
.

Use
of
two
carriers
permitted
ground
receivers
to
reduce
navigation
errors
caused
by
ionospheric
refraction
.

The
Transit
system
also
provided
the
first
world-wide
time-keeping
service
,
allowing
clocks
everywhere
to
be
synchronised
with
00
micro-second
accuracy
.

The
transit
satellite
broadcast
on
000
and
000
MHz
.

The
two
frequencies
were
used
to
allow
the
bending
of
the
satellite
radio
beacons
by
the
ionosphere
to
be
canceled
out
,
thereby
improving
location
accuracy
.

The
critical
information
that
allowed
the
receiver
to
compute
location
was
a
unique
frequency
curve
caused
by
the
Doppler
effect
.

The
Doppler
effect
caused
an
apparent
compression
of
the
carrier
's
wavelength
as
the
satellite
approached
the
receiver
,
and
stretching
of
wavelengths
as
the
satellite
receded
.

The
spacecraft
traveled
at
about
00,000
mph
,
which
could
increase
or
decrease
the
received
carrier
signal
by
as
much
as
00
kHz
.

This
Doppler
curve
was
unique
for
each
location
within
line-of-sight
of
the
satellite
.

For
instance
,
the
earth
's
rotation
caused
the
ground
receiver
to
move
toward
or
away
from
the
satellite
's
orbit
,
creating
a
non-symmetric
Doppler
shift
for
approach
and
recession
,
allowing
the
receiver
to
determine
whether
it
was
east
or
west
of
the
satellite
's
north-south
ground
track
.

Calculating
the
most
likely
receiver
location
was
not
a
trivial
exercise
.

The
navigation
software
used
the
satellite
's
motion
to
compute
a
'
trial
'
Doppler
curve
,
based
on
an
initial
'
trial
'
location
for
the
receiver
.

The
software
would
then
perform
a
least
squares
curve
fit
for
each
two-minute
section
of
the
Doppler
curve
,
recursively
moving
the
trial
position
until
the
trial
Doppler
curve
'
most
closely
'
matched
the
actual
Doppler
received
from
the
satellite
for
all
0-minute
curve
segments
.

If
the
receiver
was
also
moving
relative
to
the
earth
,
such
as
aboard
a
ship
or
airplane
,
this
would
cause
mismatches
with
the
idealized
Doppler
curves
,
and
degrade
position
accuracy
.

However
,
positional
accuracy
could
usually
be
computed
to
within
000-meters
for
a
slow-moving
ship
,
even
with
reception
of
just
one
two-minute
Doppler
curve
.

This
was
the
navigation
criterion
demanded
by
the
U.S.
Navy
,
since
American
submarines
would
normally
expose
their
UHF
antenna
for
only
0-minutes
to
obtain
a
usable
Transit
fix
.

The
U.S.
Submarine
version
of
the
Transit
System
also
included
a
special
encrypted
(
and
more
accurate
)
version
of
the
downloaded
satellite
's
orbital
data
.

This
enhanced
data
allowed
for
considerably
enhanced
system
accuracy
(
not
unlike
Selective
Availability
under
GPS
)
.

Using
this
enhanced
mode
accuracy
was
typically
less
than
00
meters
.

(
Between
LORAN
C
and
GPS
.
)

Certainly
,
the
most
accurate
navigation
system
of
its
day

hole
convention
.

This
data
was
sent
to
the
Satellite
Control
Center
at
Applied
Physics
Laboratory
in
Laurel
,
Maryland
using
commercial
and
military
teleprinter
networks
.

The
data
from
the
fixed
ground
stations
provided
the
location
information
on
the
transit
satellite
orbit
.

Locating
a
transit
satellite
in
earth
orbit
from
a
known
ground
station
using
the
Doppler
shift
is
simply
the
reverse
of
using
the
known
location
of
the
satellite
in
orbit
to
locate
an
unknown
location
on
the
earth
,
again
using
the
Doppler
shift
.

A
typical
ground
station
occupied
a
small
Quonset
hut
.

The
accuracy
of
the
ground
station
measurements
was
a
function
of
the
ground
station
master
clock
accuracy
.

Initially
a
quartz
oscillator
in
a
temperature
controlled
oven
was
used
as
the
master
clock
.

The
master
clock
was
checked
daily
for
drift
using
a
VLF
receiver
tuned
to
a
US
Navy
low
frequency
VLF
station
.

The
VLF
signal
had
the
property
that
the
phase
of
the
VLF
signal
did
not
change
from
day
to
day
at
noon
along
the
path
between
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
and
thus
could
be
used
to
measure
oscillator
drift
.

Later
rubidium
beam
and
cesium
beam
clocks
were
used
.

Ground
stations
had
number
names
;
for
example
,
Station
000
was
McMurdo
Station
,
Antarctica
.

For
many
years
during
the
0000s
this
station
was
staffed
by
a
graduate
student
and
an
undergraduate
student
,
typically
in
electrical
engineering
,
from
the
University
of
Texas
at
Austin
.

Other
stations
were
located
at
New
Mexico
State
University
,
the
University
of
Texas
at
Austin
,
Sicily
,
Japan
,
Seychelles
Island
,
Thule
Greenland
and
a
number
of
other
locations
.

The
Greenland
and
Antarctica
stations
saw
every
pass
of
every
transit
satellite
because
of
their
near
pole
location
for
these
polar
orbiting
satellites

Portable
Geoceiver
=
=
=
A
portable
version
of
the
ground
station
was
called
a
Geoceiver
and
was
used
to
make
field
measurements
.

This
receiver
,
power
supply
,
punched
tape
unit
,
and
antennas
could
fit
in
a
number
of
padded
aluminum
cases
and
could
be
shipped
as
extra
cargo
on
an
airline
.

Data
was
taken
over
a
period
of
time
,
typically
a
week
,
and
sent
back
to
the
Satellite
Control
Center
for
processing
.

Therefore
,
unlike
GPS
,
there
was
not
an
immediate
accurate
location
of
the
geoceiver
location
.

A
geoceiver
was
permanently
located
at
the
South
Pole
Station
and
operated
by
USGS
personnel
.

Since
it
was
located
on
the
surface
of
a
moving
ice
sheet
,
its
data
was
used
to
measure
the
ice
sheet
movement
.

Other
geoceivers
were
taken
out
in
the
field
in
Antarctica
during
the
summer
and
were
used
to
measure
locations
,
for
example
the
movement
of
the
Ross
Ice
Shelf
.

The
AN/UYK
-0
Computer
=
=
=
Since
no
computer
small
enough
to
fit
through
a
submarine
's
hatch
existed
(
in
0000
)
,
a
new
computer
was
designed
,
named
the
AN/UYK
-0
.

It
was
built
with
rounded
corners
to
fit
through
the
hatch
and
was
about
five
feet
tall
and
sealed
to
be
water-proof
.

The
principal
design
engineer
was
then-UCLA-faculty-member
Lowell
Amdahl
,
brother
of
Gene
Amdahl
.

The
AN/UYK
-0
was
built
by
the
Ramo-Wooldridge
Corporation
(
later
TRW
)
for
the
''
Lafayette
''
class
SSBNs
.

It
was
equipped
with
0,000
words
of
00-bit
core
memory
plus
parity
bit
,
threaded
by
hand
at
their
Canoga
Park
factory
.

Cycle
time
was
about
one
microsecond
.

The
AN/UYK
-0
was
a
"
micro-programmed
"
machine
with
a
00-bit
word
length
that
lacked
hardware
commands
to
subtract
,
multiply
or
divide
,
but
could
add
,
shift
,
form
one
's
complement
,
and
test
the
carry
bit
.

Instructions
to
perform
standard
fixed
and
floating
point
operations
were
software
subroutines
and
programs
were
lists
of
links
and
operators
to
those
subroutines
.

For
example
,
the
"
subtract
"
subroutine
had
to
form
the
one
's
complement
of
the
subtrahend
and
add
it
.

Multiplication
required
successive
shifting
and
conditional
adding
.

The
most
interesting
feature
of
the
AN/UYK
-0
instruction
set
was
that
the
machine-language
instructions
had
two
operators
that
could
simultaneously
manipulate
the
arithmetic
registers
,
for
example
complementing
the
contents
of
one
register
while
loading
or
storing
another
.

It
also
may
have
been
the
first
computer
that
implemented
a
single-cycle
indirect
addressing
ability
.

During
a
satellite
pass
,
a
GE
receiver
would
receive
the
orbital
parameters
and
encrypted
messages
from
the
satellite
,
as
well
as
measure
the
Doppler
shifted
frequency
at
intervals
and
provide
this
data
to
the
AN/UYK
-0
computer
.

The
computer
would
also
receive
from
the
ship
's
inertial
navigation
system
(
SINS
)
,
a
reading
of
latitude
and
longitude
.

Using
this
information
the
AN/UYK
-0
ran
the
least
squares
algorithm
and
provided
a
location
reading
in
about
fifteen
minutes
.

There
were
00
other
satellites
in
the
Transit
series
that
were
assigned
the
''
'
Transit
''
'
name
by
NASA
.

Transit
0A
,
launched
June
00
,
0000
,
was
the
first
satellite
to
use
a
radioactive
power
source
(
a
SNAP-0
)
.

Transit
0B
(
0000
)
also
had
a
SNAP-0
RTG
.

It
was
notable
for
sustaining
damage
in
a
nuclear
explosion
,
specifically
the
United
States
Starfish
Prime
high-altitude
nuclear
test
in
0000
.

Transit
0A0
(
0000
)
had
a
SNAP-0
RTG
.

Transit
0B-0
(
0000
)
had
a
SNAP-0
RTG
.

Transit
0B-0
(
0000
)
had
a
SNAP-0A
RTG
.

Transit-0
and
0B0
(
0000
)
both
had
"
a
nuclear
power
source
"
.

Transit-0B0
and
0B0
(
0000
)
both
had
"
a
nuclear
power
source
"
.

The
US
Air
Force
also
periodically
launched
short
lived
satellites
equipped
with
radio
beacons
of
000
MHz
and
000
MHz
at
much
lower
orbits
to
study
orbital
drag
.

The
Transit
ground
tracking
stations
tracked
these
satellites
as
well
,
locating
the
satellites
within
their
orbits
using
the
same
principles
.

The
satellite
location
data
was
used
to
collect
orbital
drag
data
,
including
variations
in
the
upper
atmosphere
and
the
Earth
's
gravitational
field
.

.

Warren
is
the
principle
city
of
the
Warren
,
PA
Micropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
Warren
was
initially
inhabited
by
Native
Americans
of
the
Seneca
nation
.

French
explorers
had
longstanding
claims
to
the
area
which
they
acted
to
secure
in
an
unambiguous
fashion
with
an
military-Amerindian
expedition
in
0000
that
buried
a
succession
of
plaques
claiming
the
territory
as
France
's
in
response
to
the
formation
of
the
colonial
Ohio
Company
and
the
first
of
these
was
buried
in
Warren
but
ultimately
control
was
transferred
to
the
British
after
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

After
the
Revolutionary
War
,
General
William
Irvine
and
Andrew
Ellicott
were
sent
to
the
area
to
lay
out
a
town
in
0000
.

It
was
named
after
Major
General
Joseph
Warren
.

The
first
permanent
structure
in
Warren
,
a
storehouse
built
by
the
Holland
Land
Company
,
was
completed
in
0000
.

Daniel
McQuay
of
Ireland
was
the
first
permanent
inhabitant
of
European
descent
.

Lumber
was
the
main
industry
from
0000
–
0000
,
as
the
abundance
of
wood
and
access
to
water
made
it
profitable
to
float
lumber
down
the
Allegheny
River
to
Pittsburgh
.

David
Beaty
discovered
oil
in
Warren
in
0000
while
drilling
for
natural
gas
in
his
wife
's
flower
garden
.

Oil
came
to
dominate
the
city
's
economy
.

Many
of
the
town
's
large
Victorian
homes
were
built
with
revenue
generated
by
the
local
oil
and
timber
industries

Jonathan
Letterman
,
the
"
Father

"
during

,
was
also
born
in
Canonsburg
.

of
the
members

In
the
weeks

,
the
town
frequently
gains
media
attention
for
its
residents
setting
up
folding
chairs
along
the
town
's
main
street
to
stake
claim
to
prime
viewing
areas
.

The
borough
is
served
by
the
Canon-McMillan
School
District
.

History
The
exact
date
of
the
first
settlement
near
the
current
site
of
Canonsburg
is
unclear
.

Colonel
John
Canon
,
a
common
miller
who
also
served
as
justice
of
the
Virginia
courts
at
Fort
Dunmore
(
now
Pittsburgh
)
,
purchased
some
land
from
the
state
of
Virginia
around
Chartiers
Creek
,
sometime
before
May
0000
.

The
state
had
claimed
what
is
now
southwestern
Pennsylvania
in
a
dispute
that
would
not
finally
be
settled
until
later
in
the
decade
.

In
0000
Pennsylvania
carved
Washington
County
out
of
Westmoreland
,
and
the
county
seat
was
established
at
Washington
.

The
notes
of
the
first
session
of
the
Washington
County
Court
during
that
year
indicate
a
call
for
a
road
from
Canon
's
mill
to
Pittsburgh
.

The
road
to
Pittsburgh
,
called
Pitt
Street
,
remains
in
part
today
as
an
archaic
and
indirect
route
to
the
city
.

The
first
surviving
plat
of
the
town
is
from
April
00
,
0000
.

Lots
were
sold
around
Canon
's
property
,
and
the
emerging
town
took
the
name
of
Canonsburg
shortly
thereafter
.

Many
of
the
participants
in
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
of
July
0000
were
residents
of
present-day
Washington
County
,
which
includes
Canonsburg
.

Some
of
the
insurrectionists
are
believed
to
have
gathered
in
the
town
's
Black
Horse
Tavern
.

However
,
records
do
not
indicate
whether
any
Canonsburg
residents
participated
in
any
of
the
violent
acts
which
occurred
during
the
rebellion
.

The
town
was
the
site
of
the
first
institution
of
higher
learning
west
of
the
Allegheny
Mountains
,
Jefferson
College
.

Founded
in
0000
,
it
was
the
eleventh
such
institution
in
the
United
States
.

The
Phi
Gamma
Delta
and
Phi
Kappa
Psi
fraternities
were
both
founded
at
Jefferson
College
.

Phi
Gamma
Delta
,
of
whom
President
Calvin
Coolidge
was
a
member
,
was
founded
in
0000
.

Phi
Kappa
Psi
,
of
whom
President
Woodrow
Wilson
and
over
000
U.S.
Congress
men
claim
membership
,
was
founded
in
0000
.

The
school
would
go
on
to
become
Washington
&
Jefferson
College
in
nearby
Washington
.

For
generations
,
Jefferson
College
financially
supported
Canonsburg
by
accounting
for
much
of
its
income
.

However
,
in
0000
,
the
college
was
moved
to
nearby
Washington
,
leaving
behind
empty
college
rooming
and
boarding
houses
,
known
as
the
"
forts
"
.

Canonsburg
's
largest
financial
draw
having
left
,
it
would
take
the
introduction
of
the
railroad
system
to
return
the
city
to
its
former
glory
.

The
railroad
system
,
on
its
way
from
Mansfield
(
Carnegie
)
to
Washington
(
See
:
Chartiers
Branch
)
,
was
fully
operational
,
as
scheduled
,
on
May
00
,
0000
.

The
first
scheduled
train
departed
from
the
Washington
depot
carrying
"
borough
authorities
,
the
committee
of
arrangement
and
reception
,
as
well
as
Rankin
’s
Cornet
Band
and
a
number
of
…
prominent
citizens
who
had
been
invited
to
join
the
excursion
.
"

They
traveled
to
Mansfield
,
where
they
waited
for
the
special
to
arrive
from
Pittsburgh
.

The
special
had
00
coaches
pulled
by
two
locomotives
and
was
filled
with
a
large
number
of
dignitaries
,
most
especially
the
mayors
of
Pittsburgh
and
Allegheny
.

The
special
then
made
it
down
the
newly
laid
tracks
,
passing
stations
full
of
spectators
to
cheer
on
the
train
.

Canonsburg
had
a
large
crowd
of
supporters
,
and
many
people
climbed
aboard
the
train
to
ride
along
to
Washington
.

There
,
led
by
Pittsburgh
’s
Great
Western
Band
,
the
crowd
marched
to
Town
Hall
for
a
round
of
speeches
.

The
Washington
Reporter
editor
pronounced
the
day
"
a
grand
success
.
"

In
0000
the
Washington
and
Canonsburg
Railway
Company
linked
the
two
towns
with
a
trolley
line
.

The
company
was
bought
by
the
Philadelphia
Company
in
0000
,
later
becoming
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Railway
Company
,
linking
through
to
Pittsburgh
as
part
of
their
interurban
service
in
0000
.

The
line
closed
on
August
00
,
0000
,
with
the
last
three
trolley
cars
travelling
south
through
Canonsburg
to
the
Pennsylvania
Trolley
Museum
in
0000
shortly
before
the
track
was
removed
.

History
Origins
of
the
Township
The
historical
character
of
Chartiers
Township
has
been
significantly
influenced
by
its
agricultural
history
,
its
natural
resources
such
as
coal
and
oil
and
its
location
along
major
transportation
routes
.

Chartiers
Township
is
located
in
Washington
County
,
PA
.

The
County
was
formed
during
the
Revolutionary
War
period
on
March
00
,
0000
from
part
of
Westmoreland
County
.

It
was
the
first
County
formed
after
the
signing
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
.

The
new
County
was
quite
large
and
contained
what
would
later
become
Greene
,
Allegheny
and
Beaver
Counties
.

Chartiers
Township
was
erected
by
the
Washington
County
Court
of
Quarter
Session
from
the
southern
part
of
Cecil
Township
on
March
00
,
0000
with
a
petition
from
the
inhabitants
residing
in
its
boundaries
.

The
bounds
of
the
Township
were
reduced
in
0000
by
the
erection
of
Canton
Township
and
Mt.
Pleasant
Township
in
0000
.

After
some
adjustments
,
the
Township
has
maintained
its
current
boundaries
since
0000
.

The
name
"
Chartiers
"
is
that
of
a
French-American
trader
,
Pierre
Chartiere
.

The
emergence
of
the
Chartiers
Valley
Railroad
and
then
the
local
Interstate
Highways
mitigated
the
creek
's
use
for
transportation
but
its
significance
at
the
end
of
the
00th
century
is
demonstrated
in
the
name
for
the
Township
.

Colonel
James
Allison
settled
in
the
Township
in
0000
as
one
of
the
first
settlers
on
Chartiers
Creek
.

He
and
his
family
were
one
of
the
twenty
families
who
came
to
this
area
in
that
year
,
among
whom
were
the
Scotts
,
McDowells
,
Parks
,
Morrisions
,
Struthers
,
Norris
,
and
others
.

At
this
time
,
there
was
navigation
on
Chartiers
Creek
.

US
Congress
declared
this
creek
as
navigable
and
in
fact
some
local
entrepreneurs
used
it
as
a
point
of
shipping
flour
to
New
Orleans
.

Colonial
John
Canon
,
the
founder
of
Canonsburg
,
loaded
two
boats
with
flour
from
his
mill
and
shipped
them
to
New
Orleans
via
Chartiers
Creek
and
the
Ohio
River
.

In
0000
,
the
state
legislature
declared
"
Chartiers
Creek
a
public
highway
for
boats
and
rafts
"
.

When
coal
was
discovered
in
Washington
County
in
the
0000s
it
was
shipped
down
Chartiers
Creek
to
the
Ohio
River
in
times
of
high
water
.

Coal
had
also
become
one
of
the
main
products
of
Chartiers
Township
for
many
years
.

Bituminous
coal
was
first
discovered
in
Washington
County
on
the
James
Allison
tract
about
0000
.

It
was
mined
for
a
long
time
for
domestic
use
and
for
blacksmith
purposes
at
twenty-five
(
00
)
cents
a
bushel
.

By
0000
,
twenty
(
00
)
or
more
coal
banks
could
be
counted
and
with
the
coming
of
the
railroads
,
mining
became
a
big
business
.

The
wealth
of
coal
drew
interest
in
the
Township
for
its
solid
employment
opportunities
though
the
work
could
be
dirty
and
dangerous
.

Soon
the
extraction
and
transportation
of
coal
become
more
advanced
and
the
need
for
workers
escalated
.

Mining
was
the
chief
occupation
with
mines
in
the
Meadow
Lands
,
Richhill
,
Arden
,
Midland
and
Westland
areas
.

Early
towns
were
Arden
,
Meadow
Lands
,
McGovern
,
Shingiss
,
McConnells
Mill
and
Gretna
.

In
0000
,
the
Township
's
population
was
0,000
persons
and
by
0000
it
was
0,000
persons
.

In
0000
the
Township
was
divided
into
seven
districts
,
and
in
0000
comfortable
school
houses
were
erected
in
each
district
.

School
funding
in
0000
was
$
000.00
but
had
decreased
in
0000
to
$
000.00
.

By
0000
,
there
were
ten
districts
with
ten
teachers
and
000
students
and
in
0000
;
there
were
twenty
schools
and
000
students
.

Average
salary
for
a
teacher
was
$
00.00
(
males
)
and
$
00.00
(
females
)
in
0000
.

The
Township
began
building
its
own
highschool
in
the
early
0000s
.

Chartiers
and
Houston
formed
a
jointure
and
the
Chartiers-Houston
School
District
had
its
first
graduating
class
in
0000
.

By
0000
and
0000
,
Allison
Park
Elementary
and
Chartiers
Houston
Junior/Senior
High
School
had
0000
students
.

Significant
Historical
Sites
and
Events
Chartiers
Township
has
been
the
site
of
significant
historical
events
over
the
past
three
hundred
years
.

The
"
Concord
Coaches
"
stage
coach
line
ran
through
the
Meadow
Lands
on
the
Pittsburgh
and
Washington
line
,
whose
function
was
later
replaced
by
Chartiers
Valley
Railway
also
located
in
the
Township
.

The
Chartiers
Valley
Railroad
Company
was
begun
in
0000
and
was
the
second
railroad
project
of
its
size
in
the
United
States
.

The
Railroad
Company
started
to
build
rail
lines
from
Pittsburgh
in
0000
,
to
Canonsburg
in
0000
,
finally
completed
to
Washington
in
0000
.

This
railroad
brought
a
great
change
in
the
valley
as
coal
mines
were
opened
and
farmers
could
ship
their
produce
and
milk
to
Pittsburgh
and
many
other
kinds
of
trade
were
carried
over
the
new
railroad
.

In
0000
,
Ewing
Pump
Station
was
erected
by
the
Southwest
Pennsylvania
Oil
Company
and
was
located
in
the
Meadow
Lands
.

It
pumped
about
00,000
barrels
of
oil
per
day
,
to
and
from
different
points
within
a
radius
of
thirty-five
miles
.

The
total
tankage
stored
at
the
station
was
about
0,000,000
barrels
,
contained
in
seventy
tanks
.

On
June
00
,
0000
,
two
00,000
barrel
oil
tanks
were
struck
by
lightning
.

One
tank
exploded
sending
thousands
of
barrels
of
burning
oil
floating
down
Chartiers
Creek
,
killing
all
vegetation
and
trees
along
the
stream
for
a
mile
.

In
0000
,
the
Washington
County
Fair
Association
was
chartered
and
the
first
fair
exhibition
was
held
at
Arden
Downs
in
the
Township
.

The
Hagan
Stock
farm
at
Arden
was
chosen
to
purchase
as
the
fair
's
location
due
to
its
excellent
race
track
.

The
farm
had
been
used
for
training
and
racing
horses
,
with
complete
facilities
for
horse
boarding
year
round
.

The
principal
attraction
of
the
fair
at
that
time
and
for
years
to
follow
was
this
racing
track
.

The
fair
has
expanded
over
the
years
drawing
thousands
to
view
its
agricultural
events
and
exhibits
and
for
traditional
fair
rides
,
entertainment
,
games
and
local
food
.

Other
events
are
also
located
at
the
fairgrounds
throughout
the
year
.

The
Washington
County
Fair
has
continued
through
the
century
as
a
growing
and
flourishing
enterprise
and
continues
as
a
showcase
for
the
region
's
agricultural
enterprises
.

The
site
of
the
Pennsylvania
Trolley
Museum
is
also
located
in
the
Township
on
the
former
Pittsburgh
Railways
Company
's
trolley
line
to
Washington
which
was
abandoned
in
0000
.

This
trolley
system
served
as
an
important
link
for
the
south
hills
of
Pittsburgh
and
Washington
County
residents
who
traveled
for
work
,
shopping
,
and
recreation
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railway
Museum
Association
non-profit
organization
purchased
a
0,000-foot
section
of
railway
line
of
the
Pittsburgh
Railways
Company
's
abandoned
Washington
interurban
trolley
line
from
Washington
to
Pittsburgh
near
the
Washington
County
Fairgrounds
in
Chartiers
Township
.

On
February
0
,
0000
,
the
museum
's
first
three
cars
were
moved
to
the
site
.

The
museum
was
opened
to
the
public
in
June
0000
,
providing
visitors
with
short
demonstration
trolley
rides
and
an
informal
tour
of
the
car
house
.

Since
then
,
using
mostly
volunteer
help
,
new
cars
and
facilities
including
the
Visitor
Education
Center
,
Museum
store
and
Trolley
Display
Building
have
been
built
and
more
than
thirty
(
00
)
cars
are
on
display
to
the
public
.

Today
a
"
spur
"
off
the
original
section
of
trolley
track
has
been
built
across
the
road
to
the
County
Fairgrounds
to
allow
visitors
to
experience
a
ride
on
a
restored
trolley
for
a
scenic
0-mile
ride
.

The
Pennsylvania
Trolley
Museum
exceptionally
preserves
the
historical
significance
of
this
once
vital
form
of
transportation
through
the
region
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
a
one-room
office
building
with
garage
was
constructed
for
a
municipal
building
.

In
0000
,
the
Board
of
Supervisors
entered
into
a
building
project
to
renovate
the
existing
Township
Building
and
garages
into
administrative
offices
,
tax
offices
and
Police
Department
,
plus
razing
a
portion
of
the
Fort
Pitt
Fixture
Building
to
make
room
for
a
new
meeting
center
and
parking
lot
.

The
remaining
section
of
Fort
Pitt
's
building
was
steel-sided
and
houses
the
Public
Works
Department
.

The
John
White
House
was
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Present
and
Regional
Setting
Chartiers
Township
is
a
00.00
square
mile
municipality
located
in
central
Washington
County
,
five
(
0
)
miles
north
of
the
City
of
Washington
and
twenty-five
(
00
)
miles
southwest
of
the
major
metropolitan
area
of
Pittsburgh
.

The
Township
is
bordered
on
the
northwest
by
Mount
Pleasant
Township
,
northeast
by
Cecil
Township
,
the
east
by
Canonsburg
Borough
,
Houston
Borough
and
North
Strabane
Township
,
the
southeast
by
South
Strabane
Township
and
the
southwest
by
Canton
Township
.

Along
its
southeastern
border
,
runs
Chartiers
Creek
separating
it
from
North
and
South
Strabane
.

Regional
access
to
the
Township
is
provided
by
Interstate
00
on
to
Racetrack
Road
and
Pike
Street
.

The
Township
is
governed
by
a
Board
of
Supervisors
,
with
the
assistance
of
municipal
staff
and
Commissions
,
such
as
the
Planning
Commission
and
Zoning
Hearing
Board
.

The
Chartiers-Houston
School
District
services
the
educational
needs
of
the
Township
in
addition
to
the
residents
of
Houston
Borough
.

Chartiers
Township
can
be
categorized
as
primarily
a
residential
and
agricultural
community
.

Many
seek
rural
parcels
in
the
Township
for
the
keeping
of
private
horses
,
and
farming
is
still
a
viable
enterprise
.

There
are
many
post
World
War
II
housing
developments
along
with
new
residential
developments
making
it
a
'
bedroom
community
'
.

Residential
development
pressures
have
increased
from
nearby
growth
areas
such
as
Peters
Township
,
North
and
South
Strabane
and
Allegheny
County
.

New
residential
development
in
the
Township
over
the
past
ten
years
includes
Arden
Mills
,
The
Ridgeview
Plan
and
The
Summit
.

Despite
this
,
much
of
Chartiers
nearly
twenty-five
(
00
)
square
miles
is
still
rural
in
nature
.

Most
suburban
development
in
the
Township
has
and
will
occur
on
agricultural
land
and/or
on
wooded
sites
.

The
Meadow
Lands
is
home
to
most
of
the
commercial
establishments
.

There
are
a
number
of
light
industrial
sites
between
the
Washington
County
Fairgrounds
and
Chartiers-Houston
High
School
.

Throughout
the
0000s
and
0000s
the
region
suffered
with
the
loss
of
traditional
mining
and
manufacturing
employment
base
.

As
some
of
these
mining
and
industrial
enterprises
in
the
Township
have
closed
,
new
industry
has
located
in
the
Township
such
as
the
DBT
National
Headquarters
.

The
Arden
Landfill
is
located
in
the
Township
and
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
has
issued
a
major
permit
modification
to
Arden
Landfill
Inc.
,
authorizing
an
expansion
of
the
existing
municipal
landfill
in
Chartiers
Township
from
000
acres
to
000
acres
.

Historically
,
the
Township
is
best
known
for
the
two
important
cultural
amenities
of
the
Washington
County
Fairgrounds
and
the
Pennsylvania
Trolley
Museum
.

These
two
resources
and
the
events
held
at
them
should
be
utilized
to
promote
the
Township
in
the
region
.

Chartiers
Township
's
resources
and
convenient
location
in
the
regional
transportation
network
has
attracted
increased
development
pressures
.

The
Township
's
proximity
to
the
retail
development
along
Route
00/Interstate
00
from
Allegheny
County
and
the
substantial
development
of
the
North
and
South
Strabane
corridor
with
Trinity
Point
,
the
Meadow
Lands
Racetrack
and
Casino
and
the
Tangeer
Outlets
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
community
in
the
upcoming
years
.

The
easy
access
and
proximity
of
these
employment
and
commercial
activities
will
make
the
Township
even
more
attractive
as
a
place
to
reside
.

These
centers
provide
employment
,
shopping
and
cultural
opportunities
while
their
proximity
will
continue
to
place
growth
and
development
pressures
upon
the
Township
.

The
availability
of
land
in
the
area
will
act
as
impetus
for
the
attraction
of
development
in
the
community
.

The
lack
of
water
and
sewage
service
in
many
areas
may
be
one
of
the
impediments
to
future
growth
.

got
its
name
from
a
combination
of
William
Donner
and
Nora
Mellon
,
banker
Andrew
W.
Mellon
's
wife
.

Donora
's
nickname
is
"
The
Home
of
Champions
"
mainly
because
of
the
large
number
of
famous
athletes
that
have
called
Donora
their
home
.

Agriculture
,
coal-mining
,
steel-making
,

.

Recently
,
Donora
and

Mid-Mon
Valley
communities

seen
an
economic
re-emergence
as
a
result
of
the
increased
economic
activity
in
the
area
of
the
newly
emerging
Marcellus
Shale
natural
gas
industry
.

Local
government
leaders
hope

renew
the
prosperity
that
was
once
a
trademark
of
the
Mon
Valley
region
.

History
The
land

was
part
of
a
tract
purchased
from
John
Haft
on

,

,
by
Daniel
Houston
,
a
near
relative
of
Gen.
Sam
Houston
,
leader
of
the
Texans
in
their
war
for
independence
from
Mexico
.

After
the
Chartiers
Valley
Railroad
was
completed
through
that
section
in
0000
,
David
C.
Houston
,
a
son
of
Daniel
Houston
,
saw
the
possibilities
of
a
town
at
that
point
and
laid
out
the
present
plan
of
Houstonville
.

The
first
house
in
the

town
was
completed
in
the
summer
of
0000
by
A.
T.
Haft
and
the
second
by
J.
C.
Johnson
.

A
few

H.
E.
Riggle
laid
out
a
plan
adjoining
which
was
called
Riggletown
until
the
Borough
of
Houstonville
was
incorporated
on
May
00
,
0000
.

The
town
grew
slowly
for
several
years
,
but
with
the
development
of
gas
in
the
‘
00s
and
coal
in
later
years
the
town
has
grown
until
now
it
is
of
considerable
importance
.

There
are
a
number
of
coal
mines
in
the
vicinity
,
and

sit
astride
Interstates
00
and
00
,
as
well
as
US
Route
00
and
State
Route
000
.

The
township
's
location
at
the
juncture
of
these
major
arteries
,
in
addition
to
US
Route
00
,
has
played
no
small
part
in
its
rapid
commercial
development
.

A
third
major
commercial
center
,
The
Foundry
,
opened
in
spring
0000
.

The
Foundry
has
since
closed
due
to
land
subsidence
and
all
major
stores
have
moved
out
.

A
housing
boom
occurred
simultaneously
with
the
commercial
development
.

Washington
Woods
and
Washington

,
two
higher

developments
,
were
recently
finished
.

Villas
on
the
Green
,
a

Road
.

Strabane
Manor
,
a
000
unit
townhouse
complex
,

development
,
a
developing

complex
with
over

units
.

In
addition
to
these

,
The
Preserve
at
Timber
's
Edge
,
a

board
of
supervisors
,
in
conjunction
with
the
Washington
County
Re-Development
Authority
and
the
Trinity
Area
School
Board
approved
the
Tax-Incremented
Financing
(
TIF
)
Plan
for
Bass
Pro
Shops
and
Tanger
Outlet
Malls
.

These
developments
will
be
larger
than
all
of
the
township
's
current
developments
and
will
be
located
alongside
of
Interstate
00
.

The
developments
will
be
located
close
to
The
Meadows
Racetrack
and
Casino
in
neighboring
North
Strabane
.

Development
plans
include
a
large
Outdoor
World
store
,
in
addition
to
other
Bass
Pro
Shops
developments
.

Bass
Pro
also
intends
to
install
sizable
outdoor
recreational
and
test
facilities
for
ATVs
,
boats
,
and
hunting
gear
.

Next
to
the
Bass
Pro
Shops
will
be
Tanger
Outlet
Malls
,
a
company
nationally
known
for
its
development
of
outlet
malls
.

The
outlet
center
,
which
is
slated
to
hold
over
000
stores
,
will
be
similar
in
composition
to
the
Grove
City
Outlets
,
located
north
of
Pittsburgh
,
but
will
be
slightly
larger
than
that
development
.

Also
,
a
large
development
,
located
between
US
Route
00
and
Interstate
00
in
an
area
known
as
the
'
Zediker
Corridor
'
,
is
in
the
planning
stages
through
Consol
Energy
,
Inc.
.

Consol
Energy
,
a
company
well
known
throughout
southwestern
Pennsylvania
,
is
a
large
mining
company
that
hopes
to
develop
over
with
commercial
offices
.

The
areas
around
this
development
will
be
heavily
developed
with
residential
satellite
developments
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
development
is
over
two
times
the
size
of
the
nearby
SouthPointe
,
a
development
of
commercial
offices
with
some
housing
.

History
Delaware
Indian
chief
Tangooqua
,
commonly
known
as
"
Catfish
"
,
had
a
camp
on
a
branch
of
Chartiers
Creek
in
what
is
now
part
of
the
city
of
Washington
.

The
French
labeled
the
area
"
Wissameking
"
,
meaning
"
catfish
place
"
,
as
early
as
0000
.

The
area
of
Washington
was
settled
by
many
immigrants
from
Scotland
and
the
north
of
Ireland
along
with
settlers
from
eastern
and
central
parts
of
colonial
Virginia
.

It
was
first
settled
by
colonists
around
0000
.

The
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
passed
an
act
on
March
00
,
0000
,
erecting
the
County
of
Washington
and
naming
"
Catfish
Camp
"
as
the
place
for
holding
the
first
election
.

This
was
the
first
county
in
the
U.S.
to
be
named
in
honor
of
President
George
Washington
.

David
Hoge
laid
out
a
plan
of
lots
immediately
after
the
legislature
's
action
.

His
original
plot
carried
the
name
"
Bassett
,
alias
Dandridge
Town
,
"
but
before
the
plot
was
recorded
,
lines
were
drawn
through
"
Bassett
,
alias
Dandridge
Town
"
with
ink
,
and
the
word
"
Washington
"
was
written
above
.

There
have
long
been
rumors
among
locals
that
the
town
was
named
“
Washington
”
because
George
Washington
spent
the
night
in
the
region
once
.

This
is
not
true
however
;
Washington
had
never
been
to
the
area
.

The
original
plot
dedicated
a
tract
of
ground
to
the
people
for
recreational
purposes
.

A
lot
was
given
for
a
courthouse
where
the
current
building
now
stands
,
and
Lots
00
and
000
,
according
to
the
plan
,
were
presented
by
Hoge
to
"
His
Excellency
,
General
Washington
,
and
Mrs.
Washington
.
"

Washington
,
Pennsylvania
,
was
the
center
for
the
'
Whiskey
Rebellion
'
of
0000
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
open
rebellions
against
the
new
U.S.
government
and
Constitution
.

The
rebellion
was
centered
around
a
tax
being
imposed
on
whiskey
distillation
in
the
region
.

The
house
of
David
Bradford
,
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
,
is
now
a
museum
devoted
to
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
,
the
David
Bradford
House
,
located
on
South
Main
Street
of
the
city
.

The
town
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
February
00
,
0000
,
and
became
a
city
of
the
third
class
in
0000
.

In
August
0000
,
construction
began
of
the
Waynesburg
and
Washington
Railroad
,
conceived
by
John
Day
in
0000
and
chartered
in
0000
.

Passenger
services
ended
in
0000
,
conversion
to
standard
gauge
followed
in
0000
,
when
it
was
renamed
the
Waynesburg
Secondary
.

Freight
services
ended
in
0000
,
although
part
of
the
line
still
survives
for
access
to
a
coal
mine
.

James
B.
Wilson
chartered
The
Washington
Electric
Street
Railways
in
0000
with
construction
beginning
in
November
0000
.

The
first
line
was
built
from
the
Waynesburg
and
Washington
Narrow
Gauge
station
to
Wilson
Orchard
,
just
north
of
the
present
day
site
of
the
Washington
Hospital
.

In
0000
the
Washington
and
Canonsburg
Railway
Company
linked
the
two
towns
with
a
trolley
line
.

The
company
was
bought
by
the
Philadelphia
Company
in
0000
,
later
becoming
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Railway
Company
,
linking
through
to
Pittsburgh
as
part
of
their
interurban
service
in
0000
.

The
line
closed
on
August
00
,
0000
.

A
short
section
of
the
line
and
a
number
of
trolley
cars
are
preserved
at
the
Pennsylvania
Trolley
Museum
north
of
the
city
.

transported
anthracite
coal
from
mines
near
Carbondale
to

City
via

Coal
was
moved
by
a

gravity-railroad
from
the
mines
to
Honesdale
where
it
was
transferred
to
barges
and
transported
via
a

History
The
first
settlers
arrived
in
Bolivar
about
the
year
0000
and
settled
between
Tubmill
Creek
and
the
Conemaugh
River
.

Most
of
the
men
were
employed
by
the
Pennsylvania
Canal
.

The
canal
was
located
on
the
south
side
of
the
Conemaugh
River
.

Some
of
the
locks
still
may
be
seen
west
of
town
.

Several
small
brickyards
were
started
in
the
area
,
producing
a
red
brick
.

Some
of
the
houses
on
Second
Street
were
constructed
of
these
brick
.

They
are
still
well-preserved
today
after
exposure
to
the
elements
for
over
a
century
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
replaced
the
canal
in
0000
.

Brickyards
No.

and

and

Bolivar
was
beginning
to
grow
and
prosper
and
was
known
as
a
"
Brick
Town
"
.

In
0000
Bolivar
withdrew
from
Fairfield
Township
and
became
a
borough
.

Bolivar
borough
was
incorporated
Nov.
00
,
0000
.

The
north
side
of
the
Conemaugh
was
a
very
desirable
location
for
new
construction
of
brickyards
due
to
the
completion
of
the
Western
Pennsylvania
Railroad
from
Blairsville
to
Bolivar
,
and
the
close
proximity
to
coal
and
clay
.

No.
0
Brickyard
at
the
time
of
its
first
operation
was
the
largest
brickyard
in
the
North
American
continent
,
having
a
capacity
of
000,000
paving
blocks
each
day
.

The
Robinson
Brothers
also
constructed
a
brickyard
,
and
it
is
the
only
one
in
existence
at
the
present
time
,
being
known
as
Garfield
Refractories
Co.
.

The
Enamel
Works
started
in
0000
with
a
large
government
contract
.

The
Bolivar
School
was
constructed
of
brick
made
from
the
Enamel
Works
.

J.
B.
Hammond
got
control
of
the
five
brickyards
in
Bolivar
and
several
in
Clearfield
County
just
before
the
start
of
the
00th
century
,
and
a
rapid
expansion
took
place
.

This
might
be
called
"
The
Golden
Era
of
Bolivar
.
"

A
large
hotel
was
started
near
the
station
and
a
large
department
store
was
planned
for
Washington
and
Second
Streets
.

Pipes
were
laid
under
the
streets
for
central
heating
,
but
the
dream
was
never
realized
.

A
panic
took
place
in
0000
,
the
bank
failed
(
the
depositors
were
paid
in
full
later
)
and
the
brickyards
were
forced
into
receivership
.

From
0000
through
the
0000s
,
Bolivar
enjoyed
its
second
boom
period
.

Soissons
and
General
Refractories
took
over
the
brickyards
and
the
Lacolle
Mine
and
Ridgeview
Coal
Mines
were
opened
,
and
shipped
large
quantities
of
coal
.

Mining
,
lumbering
and
manufacturing
employed
many
persons
.

The
Lincoln
Brickyard
enjoyed
a
brief
period
of
prosperity
under
the
leadership
of
Lorenzo
Mumford
.

He
was
a
leader
,
designer
of
bricks
,
and
salesman
,
and
kept
the
yard
going
for
many
months
.

He
sold
a
million
bricks
to
the
Chase
National
Bank
in
New
York
for
construction
of
one
of
its
banks
.

Bolivar
was
hit
hard
by
the
Great
Depression
of
the
0000s
.

The
following
losses
during
the
depression
and
the
years
ensuing
have
not
been
replaced
in
many
instances
.

Bolivar
has
lost
six
brickyards
,

Calumet-Norvelt
was
a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
in
Westmoreland
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
community
was
divided
into
the
two
separate
communities
of
Calumet
and
Norvelt
for
the
0000
census
.

Although
the
US
Census
treats
Calumet
and
Norvelt
as
a
single
community
,
they
are
in
reality
two
very
different
communities
,
each
reflecting
a
different
chapter
in
how
the
Great
Depression
affected
rural
Pennsylvanians
.

Calumet
was
a
typical
“
patch
town
,
”
built
by
a
single
company
to
house
its
miners
as
cheaply
as
possible
.

The
closing
of
the
Calumet
mine
during
the
Great
Depression
caused
enormous
hardship
in
an
era
when
unemployment
compensation
and
welfare
payments
were
nonexistent
.

On
the
other
hand
,
Norvelt
was
created
during
the
depression
by
the
US
federal
government
as
a
model
community
,
intended
to
increase
the
standard
of
living
of
laid-off
coal
miners
.

Geography
Calumet-Norvelt
is
an
unincorporated
community
within
Mount
Pleasant
Township
.

Calumet-Norvelt
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United

Census
Bureau
,
the

has
a
total

all
of

.

History
of
Calumet
Calumet
was
founded
by
the
Calumet
Coke
Company
in
0000
as
a
housing
site
for
its
workers
.

The
community
,
as
originally
laid
out
,
consisted
of
twenty
double-houses
,
twelve
single-family
houses
,
and
a
few
commercial
and
industrial
buildings
.

The
workers
were
employed
in
a
coal
mine
and
also
tended
ovens
that
produced
coke
(
fuel
)
.

In
0000
,
Calumet
was
the
site
of
a
bitter
coal
miners
’
strike
against
the
H.
C.
Frick
Coke
Company
,
which
at
that
time
was
part-owner
of
Calumet
Coke
Company
.

The
coke
works
closed
in
the
0000s
,
and
the
mine
closed
in
the
early
0000s
during
the
Great
Depression
,
causing
enormous
hardship
for
the
community
’s
workers
.

History
of
Norvelt
Norvelt
,
originally
named
Westmoreland
Homesteads
,
was
created
April
00
,
0000
,
as
one
of
a
series
of
“
subsistence
homesteads
”
under
the
National
Industrial
Recovery
Act
.

These
communities
were
intended
to
allow
rural
inhabitants
to
have
an
improved
quality
of
living
,
while
largely
growing
their
own
food
.

It
was
hoped
that
these
new
communities
would
raise
the
standard
of
living
for
unemployed
coal
miners
from
nearby
Calumet
and
similar
"
patch
towns
"
in
the
area
.

Accordingly
,
each
lot
was
a
minimum
of
,
and
other
land
was
set
aside
as
a
cooperative
farm
.

The
community
’s
layout
and
home
designs
were
created
by
Paul
Bartholomew
,
an
architect
who
had
also
designed
many
notable
buildings
in
Greensburg
.

In
0000
,
the
community
’s
name
was
changed
to
Norvelt
(

RooseVELT
)
,
following
a
visit
by
Eleanor
Roosevelt
,
wife
of
President
Franklin

History
Delmont
was
initially
known
as
New
Salem
.

The
000
acres
of
land
was
warranted
to
William
Wilson
in
0000
and
upon
his
arrival
in
0000
he
named
the
area
New
Salem
.

In
0000
a
post
office
was
established
in
New
Salem
and
it
was
named
Salem
X
Roads
(
Salem
Crossroads
)
,
Pennsylvania
.

Hugh
Bigham
was
the
first
postmaster
.

Wilson
continued
to
farm
on
the
land
until
his
death
in
0000
.

After
Wilson
's
death
in
0000
his
estate
was
divided
between
his
sons
,
Thomas
and
George
.

It
was
not
until
0000
that
the
patent
was
validated
.

Eventually
,
the
family
conveyed
their
deeds
over
to
Thomas
and
he
became
the
sole
owner
of
the
property
.

Thomas
decided
to
divide
the
property
into
00
lots
to
form
a
crossroads
village
.

Thomas
Wilson
designed
the
town
around
a
watering
trough
that
was
built
in
0000
by
Hugh
Bigham
.

The
watering
trough
was
originally
known
as
the
"
running
pump
.
"

The
watering
trough
was
connected
with
wooden
pipes
to
a
"
Big
Spring
"
that
's
never
known
to
run
dry
.

In
0000
,
two
days
before
Christmas
,
00
lots
were
auctioned
off
to
form
a
"
crossroads
"
town
.

As
the
area
developed
,
the
town
was
referred
to
locally
as
"
Salem
Crossroads
.
"

On
April
0
,
0000
,
the
town
was
incorporated
as
"
New
Salem
Borough
"
and
the
post
office
still
remained
Salem
Crossroads
,
PA.
.

On
May
00,0000
,
Zachariah
Zimmerman
the
town
's
postmaster
and
druggist
changed
the
name
of
the
post
office
from
Salem
Crossroads
to
Delmont
.

The
town
and
the
post
office
carried
two
different
names
until
0000
when
Mayor
Franklin
Mangery
promoted
the
effort
to
change
the
name
of
the
town
to
Delmont
.

On
May
00,0000
residents
went
to
the
polls
and
voted
to
change
the
name
of
the
town
from
New
Salem
Borough
to
Delmont
.

Several
areas
in
and
around
the
borough
still
carry
the
Salem
reference
.

Major
navigational
roads
were
built
through
the
area
in
the
late
00th
century
,
and
what
is
now
local
Route
00
was
built
in
0000
.

The
East-West
Northern
Turnpike
was
completed
in
0000
linking
Philadelphia
to
Pittsburgh
.

Delmont
was
a
busy
stagecoach
stop
boasting
at
one
time
five
stage
coach
lines
through
the
village
.

Travelers
would
stop
tired
and
hungry
and
patronized
the
several
inns
and
taverns
in
town
.

In
0000
,
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
complete
trough
Westmoreland
County
to
Pittsburgh
.

This
was
a
faster
more
economical
way
to
travel
.

In
0000
,
the
last
stagecoach
passed
through
the
crossroads
village
and
ended
the
stagecoach
era
for
the
crossroads
town
.

The
Salem
Crossroads
Historical
Restoration
Society
which
is
no
longer
in
existence
made
a
strong
effort
to
maintain
the
local
history
and
to
restore
the
area
.

In
0000
,
the
society
purchased
Shields
Farm
.

Fred
Shields
Ewing
and
his
sister
Marjorie
Ewing
Snyder
generously
donated
half
of
the
$
000,000
purchase
price
towards
the
purchase
of
Shields
farm
.

The
farm
was
named
in
memory
of
their
"
Uncle
Bert
"
,
R.J
Shields
.

Delmont
continues
to
survive
and
thrive
.

Every
year
Delmont
hosts
the
Apple
'N
Arts
festival
on
Shields
farm
during
the
first

of

.

The
first

in

Delmont
hosts
the
Christmas

which
beings

Salem
Lutheran
church

;
and
includes
all

The
town
has
many
historical
buildings
in

.

Although
,
the
water
supply
to
the
watering
trough
was
disconnected
in

's
a

of
the

Salem
Township
and
Delmont
Roads
Aside
from
the
historical
genesis
of
the
town
as
a
toll
intersection
and
stagecoach
stop
,
one
of
Delmont
's
notable
characteristics
is
that
it
is
the
meeting
point
of
two
major
highways
,
U.S.
Route
00
and
State
Route
00
.

For
many
years
,
these
roads
did
not
directly
intersect
but
were
linked
by
a
cloverleaf
interchange
.

Delmont
became
known
for
this
interchange
;
many
local
merchants
incorporated
"
Cloverleaf
"
into
their
business
names
as
a
result
.

Recently
,
the
"
cloverleaf
"
system
was
dismantled
and
a
single-point
urban
interchange
was
built
in
its
place
.

This
change
was
made
to
accommodate
a
plan
to
widen
Route
00
,
which
is
one
of
the
most
heavily
traveled

Derry
is
a
borough
in
Westmoreland
County
in
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
,
east
of
Pittsburgh
.

The
Borough
of
Derry
,
consisting
of
the
town
area
,
should
not
be
confused
with
Derry
Township
,
which
is
a
separate
municipality
surrounding
the
borough
.

In
0000
,
the
population
numbered
0,000
,
and
in
0000
,
0,000
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Derry
,
originally
known
as
Derry
Station
,
was
created
in
0000
to
serve
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

It
was
named
after
the
village
on
PA
Route
000
originally
known
as
Derry
and
now
known
as
New
Derry
(
even
though
it
is
older
than
the
community
being
discussed
here
)
.

The
original
"
Derry
"
in
Westmoreland
County
,
Pennsylvania
was
named
after
the
city
Derry
in
Northern
Ireland
,
because
the
area
’s
first
non-Indian
inhabitants
were
Scotch-Irish
.

Derry
was
ideally
suited
for
major
railroad
facilities
because
of
its
ready
access
to
water
from
McGee
Run
(
essential
in
the
era
of
steam
locomotives
)
and
because
it
sits
atop
a
slight
summit
along
the
railroad
right-of-way
.

In
Derry
's
heyday
in
the
late
0000s
,
it
had
four
hotels
,
mainly
to
serve
railroad
workers
,
as
well
as
a
roundhouse
for
locomotive
maintenance
and
a
massive
railroad
yard
.

Derry
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
October
00
,
0000
.

Also
,
Derry
served
as
the
terminal
for
Pittsburgh
commuter
trains
until
0000
,
when
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
ceased
operating
its
commuter
service
.

The
annual
Railroad
Days
Festival
serves
to
remind
residents
of
Derry
's
railroading
heritage
.

Little
remains
of
Derry
's
railroading
boom
,
although
some
might
notice
an
unused
railroad
right-of-way
that
extends
from
Derry
westward
to
PA
Route
000
,
running
slightly
north
but
parallel
to
the
currently-used
railroad
tracks
.

This
was
an
ill-fated
project
known
as
the
Derry-Donohoe
-
Jeannette
(
DDJ
)
bypass
,
in
which
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
attempted
to
build
a
new
main
line
that
would
avoid
the
curves
and
slopes
of
the
existing
main
line
,
bypassing
Latrobe
and
Greensburg
.

Construction
of
the
bypass
began
in
the
0000s
,
including
a
large
trestle
near
Bradenville
,
but
the
new
route
was
never
completed
.

A
tragic
helicopter
crash
into
a
crowd
assembled
for
a
festival
at
St.
Joseph
's
Catholic
Church
in
Derry
killed
eight
people
and
injured
00
others
on
Labor
Day
,
0000
.

The
railroad
crossing
in
downtown
Derry
has
also
been
the
site
of
other
tragic
fatal
accidents
.

History
After
the
end
of
the
Revolutionary
War
,
an
inn
was
built
along
a
wagon
trail
that
stretched
from
Philadelphia
west
over
the
Appalachian
Mountains
to
Fort
Pitt
,
now
the
city
of
Pittsburgh
.

A
tiny
settlement
known
as
Newtown
grew
around
the
inn
,
today
the
center
of
Greensburg
's
Business
District
at
the
intersection
of
Pittsburgh
and
Main
Streets
.

At
Pittsburgh
,
the
wagon
trail
became
Penn
Avenue
.

In
0000
,
a
raid
by
Guyasuta
-
led
Seneca
Indians
accompanied
by
Canadian
rangers
burned
Hannastown
,
the
original
Westmoreland
County
seat
,
north
of
Greensburg
,
and
the
first
county
seat
west
of
the
Appalachian
Mountains
.

Newtown
became
the
new
county
seat
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
county
built
a
log
courthouse
on
land
purchased
from
two
residents
,
Christopher
Truby
and
William
Jack
.

The
Westmoreland
County
Courthouse
,
in
its
various
incarnations
,
has
stood
on
this
site
.

The
area
surrounding
the
courthouse
became
the
original
borough
of
Greensburg
,
named
for
American
Revolutionary
War
General
Nathanael
Greene
,
and
formally
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
Greensburg
had
very
little
growth
.

After
0000
,
Greensburg
became
a
growing
county
seat
with
inns
,
small
businesses
and
hardworking
residents
.

It
was
a
railroad
stop
and
the
discovery
of
large
areas
of
soft
coal
nearby
made
it
the
center
of
a
vigorous
mining
industry
in
the
late
00th
century
and
early
00th
century
.

Seton
Hill
College
,
formerly
St.
Joseph
's
Academy
,
became
a
four-year
women
's
institution
in
0000
.

Greensburg
became
a
Third-Class
City
on
January
0
,
0000
.

After
World
War
II
,
more
residential
areas
were
developed
in
various
sections
of
town
.

Greensburg
's
cultural
status
grew
as
the
Westmoreland
County
Museum
of
Art
opened
in
0000
and
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
founded
the
branch
campus
,
University
of
Pittsburgh
at
Greensburg
,
in
0000
,
now
located
in
Hempfield
Township
.

The
opening
of
Greengate
Mall
and
Westmoreland
Mall
in
0000
and
0000
,
respectively
,
marked
a
new
era
for
retail
shopping
in
the
area
,
but
negatively
impacted
retail
businesses
in
Downtown
Greensburg
's
shopping
district
.

Changes
in
local
shopping
habits
had
already
taken
its
toll
by
the
late
0000s
when
Troutman
's
Department
Store
closed
.

By
the
mid-0000s
,
city
officials
shifted
its
revitalization
plans
on
the
cultural
aspects
of
Downtown
Greensburg
,
such
as
the
restorations
of
the
Palace
Theater
and
the
historic
Train
Station
,
as
well
as
a
new
,
recently
opened
performing
arts
center
for
Seton
Hill
University
.

Also
,
in
July
0000
,
Lake
Erie
College
of
Osteopathic
Medicine
,
the
largest
medical
school
in
the
country
,
opened
a
satellite
campus
at
Seton
Hill
University
.

Now
over
000
students
study
at
LECOM
at
Seton
Hill
every
year
.

As
part
of
this
ongoing
transition
,
an
expansion
of
the
Westmoreland
Museum
of
American
Art
is
also
in
the
planning
stages
.

The
city
is
home
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Diocese
of

Silvis
and
a
four-member

.

The
mayor
and
the
City
Council
members
serve
four-year
terms
.

The
seat
of
government
is
the
Greensburg
City
Hall
.

The
small
size
of
Greensburg
has
not
deterred
it
from
being
a
player
on
the
political
scene
.

Greensburg
has
hosted
its
share
of
prominent
politicians
over
the
years
,
including
a
July
0000
visit
from
then-President

Clinton
,
former

the
site
of

National
Republican
Party
convention
–
the
first
convention
of

,
despite

's
claims
.

is
home
to
the
00th
Quartermaster
Detachment
,
a
famous
Desert
Storm
Unit
.

There
is
also
a

the
main
City
.

Economy
Originally
a
railroad
stop
on
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
Greensburg
quickly
became
the
center
of
the
coal
mining
industry
in
the
region
by
the
late
00th
century
when
large
areas
of
soft
coal
were
discovered
nearby
.

This
contributed
to
the
growth
and
development
of
the
growing
county
seat
.

Many
businesses
and
inns
flourished
within
Downtown
Greensburg
for
many
years
,
and
once
boasted
four
major
department
stores
–
JCPenney
,
Royers
,
Sears
and
its
largest
department
store
,
Troutman
's
.

In
August
0000
,
Greengate
Mall
opened
west
of
the
city
in
Hempfield
Township
.

Greengate
was
part
of
the
first
wave
of
indoor
shopping
malls
in
the
country
.

The
mall
's
opening
marked
a
new
era
for
retail
shopping
in
the
area
,
but
it
negatively
impacted
stand-alone
businesses
in
Greensburg
's
downtown
corridor
.

By
the
late
0000s
,
several
local
stores
,
including
Troutman
's
,
the
city
's
major
department
store
,
closed
.

The
downtown
area
eventually
rebounded
as
the
city
became
a
center
for
service
industries
,
professional
offices
and
banking
.

Today
,
small
downtown
shops
and
a
growing
number
of
restaurants
are
reviving
downtown
as
a
mercantile
center
.

Westmoreland
Mall
is
currently
the
largest
shopping
complex
in
the
Greensburg
area
and
all
of
Westmoreland
County
.

Greengate
Mall
suffered
losses
in
the
0000s
when
anchor
store
JCPenney
relocated
to
Westmoreland
Mall
.

As
the
mall
continued
on
its
irreversible
decline
,
the
nationally-based
Montgomery
Ward
and
the
regional
chain
Horne
's
also
closed
.

The
building
was
eventually
razed
in
0000
,
and
a
new
shopping
center
called
Greengate
Centre
,
anchored
by
a
Walmart
,
was
subsequently
built
.

Numerous
shopping
plazas
and
dining
establishments
also
line
the
Route
00
corridor
east
and
west
of
the
city
.

With
over
of
retail
space
and
growing
,
Greensburg
is
considered
the
commercial
center
of
the
Laurel
Highlands
region
of
Pennsylvania
as
well
as
one
of
the
largest
retail
markets
in
Western
Pennsylvania
.

Light
to
moderate
industry
and
service
industries
thrive
in
the
Greater
Greensburg
area
.

Several
industrial
parks
are
primarily
located
outside
the
city
limits
.

In
addition
,
the
area
is
home
to
two
large
prisons
,
the
Westmoreland
County
Prison
and
the
State
Correctional
Institution
at
Greensburg
,
both
in
Hempfield
Township
.

Housing
growth
continues
on
the
northern
end
of
the
city
,
with
the
Saybrook
Village
and
Evergreen
Hill
plans
.

The
opening
of
the
seven-story
State

Building
on

,
the
completion
of
the
four-story
addition
to
the
Courthouse
Square
Extension
,
and
the
Performing
Arts
Center
of
Seton

University
are
expected
to
add

teams
.

The

began
as
an

football
club
in

History
Perhaps

and
0
August
that
year
.

This
victory
is
credited
with
helping
to
prevent
the

Pitt
,
and
it
served
the
purpose
of
reopening

of
a
museum
,
nature

Bushy
Run
.

First
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
June
0
,
0000
,
Jeannette
earned
the
nickname
as
"
the
glass
city
"
in
recognition
of
the
numerous
glass
plants
founded
in
the
area
,
with
those
factories
contributing
to
the
city
's
original
stature
as
the
first
large
manufacturing
town
in
Westmoreland
County
.

In
fact
,
the
impact
of
the
glass
industry
was
so
significant
that
the
city
's
name
actually
comes
from
Jeannette
E.
Hartupee
McKee
,
the
wife
of
H.
Sellers
McKee
,
a
local
industrialist
who
cofounded
the
Chambers
and
McKee
Glass
Works
and
was
a
member
of
the
elite
South
Fork
Fishing
and
Hunting
Club
of
Johnstown
Flood
fame
.

Mckee
and
his
partner
J.A.
Chambers
also
have
the
distinction
of
naming
Jeannette
's
main
street
,
Clay
Avenue
after
their
financial
backer
,
Richard
W.
Clay
.

On
January
0
,
0000
,
Jeannette
became
a
third
class
city
with
Attorney
John
M.
OConnell
as
the
first
mayor
.

At
times
,
there
were
as
many
as
0
significant
glass
factories
operating
in
the
city
of
Jeannette
including
some
of
the
most
well
known
in
the
history
of
the
glass
industry
.

Names
like
Jeannette
Glass
;
Fort
Pitt
Glass
;
the
Pittsburgh
Lamp
,
Brass
and
Glass
Company
;
American-Saint
Gobain
,
Westmoreland
Glass
;
and
others
all
supplied
the
country
with
everything
from
plate
glass
windows
,
to
bottles
,
to
milk
glass
,
and
much
more
for
many
decades
.

Some
estimates
over
the
years
indicate
that
Jeannette
once
produced
somewhere
between
00-00
%
of
the
world
's
glass
.

Unfortunately
,
the
Jeannette
's
glass
industry
was
one
of
the
early
United
States
industry
victims
of
cheap
,
foreign
competition
that
made
it
less
expensive
to
produce
glass
overseas
and
today
only
two
glass
factories
remain
in
the
city
.

Jeannette
's
manufacturing
history
does
n't
end
with
the
glass
industry
.

Today
's
Elliott
Company
represents
an
evolution
dating
back
to
0000
when
William
Swan
Elliott
moved
his
company
to
Jeannette
.

The
Elliott
Company
,
owned
by
the
Carrier
Corporation
from
0000
until
0000
and
by
United
Technologies
Corporation
until
a
0000
buyout
that
returned
the
company
to
a
privately
owned
status
,
only
to
become
an
Ebara
Corporation
subsidiary
in
0000
,
has
always
had
a
solid
reputation
in
the
dynamo
,
turbine
,
and
large
rotating
equipment
industry
.

In
0000
,
the
company
produced
the
first
diesel-engine
turbocharger
used
in
a
racecar
and
subsequently
built
more
than
00,000
more
of
them
for
other
diesel
applications
.

Throughout
the
0000s
,
local
residents
routinely
witnessed
a
revolving
door
of
trains
hauling
parts
into
the
plant
on
North
0th
Street
and
hauling
the
huge
turbine
engines
back
down
the
tracks
.

Today
,
the
Elliott
Company
is
the
city
's
largest
employer
.

Jeannette
is
also
the
manufacturing
home
of
Jensen
Steam
Engine
Mfg.
Co.
,
Inc.
,
which
produces
small
working
models
of
steam
engines
and
turbines
.

The
Jensen
shop
is
only
a
few
blocks
from
the
Elliott
plant
.

The
Pennsylvania
Rubber
Works
,
which
moved
to
Jeannette
from
Erie
,
Pennsylvania
,
around
0000
,
was
yet
another
key
part
of
the
city
's
significant
industrial
base
.

Not
only
did
this
factory
become
a
significant
supplier
of
play
balls
(
basketballs
,
footballs
,
tennis
balls
,
etc.
)
and
carpet
underlay
as
part
of
General
Tire
in
its
later
years
;
but
the
original
Pennsylvania
Rubber
Works
provided
products
for
Jeeps
and
gas
masks
during
World
War
II
.

In
0000
,
the
city
went
before
the
Supreme
Court
to
defend
an
ordinance
that
banned
distributing
religious
materials
door
to
door
.

Several
members
of
the
Jehovah
's
Witnesses
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
but
were
defeated
in
Douglas
v.
City
of

Geography
The
Borough
of

is
entirely
surrounded
by
Ligonier
Township
,
which
is
a
separate
municipality
.

the

Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

Ligonier
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

History
In
0000
,
when
British
forces
launched
a
major
campaign
to
remove
French
forces
from
the
forks
of
the
Ohio
,
now
Pittsburgh
,
this
spot
on
Loyalhanna
Creek
was
the
site
of
their
westernmost
camp
before
reaching
the
Ohio
.

It
was
an
enormous
army
,
a
virtual
moving
city
of
0,000
people
,
that
temporarily
made
this
the
most
populated
spot
in
Pennsylvania
second
only
to
Philadelphia
.

The
fort
was
named
Fort
Ligonier
after
John
Ligonier
,
a
British
noble
of
French
origin
who
held
the
rank
of
Field
Marshal
in
the
British
Army
.

Eventually
,
the
name
of
the
settlement
that
grew
up
around
the
fort
was
shortened
to
Ligonier
.

In
0000
,
the
Philadelphia-Pittsburgh
Turnpike
was
completed
,
a
gravel
road
that
was
the
precursor
to
today
's
US
Route
00
.

Fort
Ligonier
was
a
logical
place
for
travelers
to
break
their
journey
,
and
with
such
commercial
opportunities
in
mind
,
a
local
resident
named
John
Ramsay
(
sometimes
spelled
Ramsey
)
laid
out
the
street
plan
,
including
the
space
now
known
as
the
Diamond
.

He
initially
called
the
town
Ramseytown
,
later
changed
to
Wellington
(
after
the
Duke
of
Wellington
)
,
and
finally
the
name
was
changed
to
Ligonier
.

Several
decades
of
prosperity
followed
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
Ligonier
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

However
,
in
0000
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
completed
,
which
avoided
Ligonier
and
passed
through
Bolivar
and
Latrobe
instead
.

Traffic
shifted
from
horse-drawn
vehicles
to
the
railroad
,
causing
the
community
's
population
to
drop
to
000
according
to
the
0000
census
.

A
quarter-century
of
stagnation
ensued
as
the
town
withered
.

Ligonier
enjoyed
a
new
impetus
when
the
Ligonier
Valley
Railroad
was
completed
in
0000
,
linking
the
community
to
Latrobe
where
connections
to
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
were
possible
.

The
Ligonier
Valley
Railroad
enabled
lumber
,
coal
,
and
quarried
stone
to
be
transported
out
of
the
Ligonier
Valley
,
which
spurred
development
of
the
town
.

Also
,
the
railroad
made
it
easier
for
Pittsbugh
residents
to
visit
Ligonier
,
causing
the
town
to
develop
as
a
summer
resort
.

Some
major
physical
changes
to
Ligonier
occurred
during
this
period
.

In
0000
,
the
Diamond
,
which
had
been
used
as
a
corral
for
horses
and
wagons
,
was
transformed
into
a
park
with
a
bandstand
.

A
large
hotel
,
the
Hotel
Breniser
,
was
built
in
0000
where
the
town
hall
currently
sits
.

In
0000-0000
,
the
Ligonier
Valley
Railroad
built
an
ornate
station
and
headquarters
building
,
which
still
stands
at
000
West
Main
Street
.

In
0000
,
the
Ligonier
Valley
Railroad
ceased
operation
,
due
to
a
combination
of
overlogging
,
decline
of
the
coal
industry
,
and
the
loss
of
passenger
traffic
to
motor
vehicles
.

The
Pittsburgh
,
Westmoreland
and
Somerset
Railroad
also
served
Ligonier
from
0000
to
0000
,
although
it
did
not
enjoy
the
success
of
the
Ligonier
Valley
Railroad
.

Lower
Burrell
is
a
city
in
Westmoreland
County
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Pennsylvania
.

Located
approximately
00
miles
northeast
of
Downtown
Pittsburgh
,
it
is
part
of
the
Pittsburgh
Metro
Area
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
In
0000
,
Burrell
Township
was
carved
out
of
Allegheny
Township
in
Westmoreland
County
due
to
an
increase
in
population
in
the
area
,
by
Judge
Jeremiah
Murry
Burrell
.

In
0000
Burrell
Township
was
divided
into
two
separate
townships
,
Lower
Burrell
and
Upper
Burrell
.

The
present-day
cities
of
New
Kensington
and
Arnold
were
once
part
of
Lower
Burrell
Township
.

In
the
years
that
followed
,
Lower
Burrell
transformed
from
a
quiet
,
rural
farm
community
to
a
residential
and
commercial
area
while
Upper
Burrell
stayed
primarily
rural
.

In
0000
,
in
the
midst
of
the
growth
of
their
community
,
township
residents
voted
to
make
Lower
Burrell
a
third
class
city
in
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
.

Lower
Burrell
continued
to
grow
substantially
until
the
0000s
.

Like
many
small
towns
in
Western
Pennsylvania
,
Lower
Burrell
suffered
economic
and
population
stagnation
with
the
collapse
of
local
heavy
industry
.

Since
the
early
0000s
,
Lower
Burrell
experienced
slight
growth
,
though
much
of
the
city
's
commercial
property
,
including
one
of
its
only
large
shopping
centers
,
remains
vacant
.

Preliminary
data
from
the
0000
census
shows
that
Lower
Burrell
has
lost
about
0
percent
of
its
population
since
0000
.

Steel-making
was
a
prominent
industry
in
Monessen
,
which
was
a
Rust
Belt
borough
in
the
"
Mon
Valley
"
of
southwestern
Pennsylvania
that
became
a
third-class
city
in
0000
.

It
is
near
Charleroi
and
Donora
,
two
similar
places
with
similar
histories
.

History
Monessen
,
named
for
the
Monongahela
River
and
the
industrial
German
city
of
Essen
,
was
created
by
land
speculators
fairly
late
in
the
history
of
the
Mon
Valley
,
after
neighboring
towns
had
already
been
settled
.

The
East
Side
Land
Company
bought
land
from
various
farmers
,
laid
out
the
streets
,
and
then
sold
the
lots
to
prospective
residents
and
employers
.

James
M.
Schoonmaker
,
who
had
made
his
fortune
in
coke
,
owned
a
controlling
interest
in
the
land
company
.

Other
investors
in
the
land
company
who
were
also
immortalized
in
street
names
include
Philander
C.
Knox
,
James
H.
Reed
,
H.
Sellers
McKee
,
George
O.
Morgan
,
and
George
B.
Motheral
.

In
May
0000
,
National
Tin
Plate
Company
,
founded
by
William
Donner
,
began
building
its
mill
,
thus
becoming
Monessen
’s
first
employer
.

Sales
of
lots
began
on
July
00
,
0000
,
for
the
general
public
and
other
employers
.

Monessen
became
a
borough
on
September
0
,
0000
.

Monessen
experienced
rapid
growth
in
the
first
two
decades
of
the
twentieth
century
,
the
population
increasing
from
0,000
in
0000
to
00,000
in
0000
and
then
to
00,000
in
0000
.

While
there
were
many
companies
operating
in
Monessen
,
the
largest
employer
was
Pittsburgh
Steel
Company
,
later
renamed
Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel
.

In
a
practice
that
is
shocking
by
today
’s
standards
(
and
not
limited
to
Monessen
)
,
pay
was
determined
by
ethnic
background
.

For
example
,
a
Welsh
immigrant
would
be
paid
more
than
an
Italian
immigrant
.

A
normal
workweek
was
00
hours
(
0
days
times
00
hours
)
.

Employers
did
not
adopt
the
eight
hour
workday
until
the
0000s
.

Monessen
’s
status
changed
from
“
borough
”
to
“
city
”
on
September
00
,
0000
.

In
the
years
following
World
War
II
,
the
region
’s
manufacturers
,
especially
the
steel
industry
,
found
it
harder
to
compete
,
leading
to
a
period
of
employment
cutbacks
.

In
0000
,
the
closure
of
Page
Steel
and
Wire
Company
was
a
major
setback
to
the
city
.

A
far
greater
blow
to
Monessen
occurred
when
its
largest
employer
,
Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel
,
closed
nearly
all
its
Monessen
operations
in
0000
.

(
The
company
’s
rail
mill
did
not
close
until
March
0000
,
due
to
a
bad
batch
of
rails
that
were
shipped
.
)

The
mill
’s
closure
marked
the
end
of
an
era
in
Monessen
's
history
.

Monessen
is
currently
trying
to
revitalize
itself
.

The
city
has
made
efforts
for
several
years
to
clean
up
abandoned
properties
in
hopes
of
revitalizing
the
city
.

In
January
0000
the
first
female
mayor
,
Mary
Jo
Smith
was
sworn
in
at
the
Monessen
Municipal
Building
.

The
Borough
of
Mount

,
consisting
of
the
town
area
,
should
not
be
confused
with
Mount

Township
,
which
is
an
entirely
separate
municipality
.

Mount
Pleasant
Township
is
predominantly
rural
and
adjoins
the
borough
to
the
north
.

In
the
past
,
Mount
Pleasant
was
a
center
of
an
extensive
coke
-
making
industry
.

Other
products
included
flour
,
lumber
,
iron
,
glass
,
foundry
products
,
etc.
.

History
The
year
of
Mount
Pleasant
's
first
non-Indian
resident
is
not
known
,
although
one
source
states
that
at
the
time
of
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
there
was
a
settlement
of
"
not
more
than
a
half
dozen
houses
.
"

Braddock
Road
(
Braddock
expedition
)
passed
through
the
western
end
of
the
future
town
in
0000
,
opening
the
area
to
settlement
.

In
0000
Michael
Smith
was
licensed
to
operate
an
inn
,
which
would
have
served
traffic
on
Glades
Road
(
sometimes
spelled
Glade
Road
)
,
now
Route
00
.

In
0000
,
Nathaniel
Marshall
sold
land
to
Andrew
McCready
,
who
laid
out
the
design
of
the
town
.

Jacob
's
Creek
Bridge
,
the
first
iron-chain
suspension
bridge

,
was
erected

town
in

.

It
was
demolished

Unfortunately
,
no
pre-0000
structures
remain
within
the

Glass
manufacturing
was
a
foundation
of
the
local
economy
,
with
Bryce

commencing
operations
in
0000
,
and

Smith
Glass
in
0000
.

The
invention
of
the
Bessemer
process
of
steelmaking
in
0000
,
which
required
coke
(
fuel
)
,
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
region
.

The
town
prospered
as
coal
deposits
were
developed
,
from
which
coke
was
made
.

However
,
the
lives
of
coal
miners
in
the
outlying
"
patch
towns
"
(
company-owned
mining
towns
)
were
arduous
,
and
labor-management
disputes
became
frequent
.

The
strike
in
Morewood
,
west
of
Mount
Pleasant
borough
,
was
the
most
violent
of
the
area
’s
strikes
,
in
which
nine
miners
were
killed
by
sheriff

deputies
on
April

Mount
Pleasant
was
disadvantaged
when
the
main
lines
of
the
railroads
bypassed
the
community
in
the
0000s
.

The
community
’s
isolation
lessened
in
0000
with
the
opening
of
the
Mount
Pleasant
and
Broadford
Railroad
,
later
part
of
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio

.

In
addition

line
of
the
Pennsylvania

connected
the

New
Kensington
is
a
city
in
Westmoreland
County
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Pennsylvania
,
situated
along
the
Allegheny
River
northeast
of
Pittsburgh
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
Census
.

The
mayor
is
Tom
Guzzo
(
D
)
,
elected
in
0000
;
he
succeeded
Frank
Link
(
D
)
,
elected
in
0000
.

History
New
Kensington
was
founded
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
Burrell
Improvement
Company
considered
the
advantages
of
the
level
land
south
of
its
home
in
Lower
Burrell
,
and
deemed
it
a
prime
location
for
a
city
and
named
the
area
"
Kensington
"
(
later
changed
to
"
New
Kensington
"
for
postal
purposes
,
because
Pennsylvania
already
had
another
city
with
that
name
)
.

In
an
attempt
to
make
New
Kensington
comparable
to
Pittsburgh
,
the
streets
were
named
with
numbers
.

Avenues
ran
parallel
to
the
river
,
while
streets
were
perpendicular
.

0th
and
0th
were
the
main
commercial
streets
.

Once
the
land
was
surveyed
,
a
public
sale
was
held
on
June
00
,
0000
.

Thousands
of
people
flooded
the
area
and
investors
began
bringing
industry
with
them
.

The
first
large
company
was
the
Pittsburgh
Reduction
Company
,
which
later
became
Alcoa
.

They
acquired
a
property
that
allowed
the
company
to
utilize
the
riverfront
.

Eventually
,
such
other
companies
as
Adams
Drilling
,
Goldsmith
and
Lowerburg
,
New
Kensington
Milling
,
New
Kensington
Brewing
,
Logan
Lumber
,
Keystone
Dairy
,
and
many
more
were
built
late
in
the
00th
century
and
continuing
into
the
early
00th
century
.

Early
achievements
included
a
railroad
station
,
the
0th
Street
bridge
,
a
passenger
boat
that
navigated
the
Allegheny
River
,
a
street
car
line
that
ran
to
Natrona
via
the
West
Penn
Railways
,
the
Kensington
Dispatch
newspaper
,
a
fire
department
,
hotel
,
opera
house
,
and
a
local
chapter
of
the
YMCA
.

In
0000
,
New
Kensington
became
the
site
of
a
modern
workers
'
housing
project
—
named
the
Aluminum
City
Terrace
—
designed
by
Marcel
Breuer
and
Walter
Gropius
,
which
set
new
standards
for
federal
housing
design
.

Breuer
and
Gropius
ascribed
to
the
famous
Bauhaus
School
of
Design
in
Germany
.

Intended
for
Alcoa
defense
workers
,
it
was
subsequently
used
to
rehouse
displaced
residents
from
other
parts
of
the
city
.

In
0000
,
tenants
from
the
Terrace
decided
to
purchase
the
housing
project
from
the
U.S.
government
to
form
a
co-op
,
managed
by
a
Board
of
Directors
,
elected
by
representatives
from
the
000
units
.

Relatively
low-cost
monthly
fees
continue
to
cover
the
costs
of
running
the
Terrace
.

Today
,
New
Kensington
contains
the
neighborhoods
of
Parnassus
,
Mount
Vernon
,
Valley
Heights
,
Valley
Camp
,
Pine
Manor
,
and

North
Huntingdon
Township
is
a
township
in
Westmoreland
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
USA
.

The
population
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Named
after
England
’s
Earl
of
Huntingdon
,
Huntingdon
Township
was
founded
on
April
0
,
0000
in
Pennsylvania
.

Huntingdon
’s
boundaries
started
at
the
mouth
of
Brush
Run
where
it
emptied
into
Brush
Creek
.

The
area
is
approximately
00
square
miles
(
00
km0
)
with
the
Township
maintaining
about
000
miles
(
000
km
)
of
roads
.

If
these
roads
were
placed
end-to-end
,
they
would
stretch
from
North
Huntingdon
to
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.

The
boundaries
,
following
along
Byerly
’s
Path
to
Braddock
Road
,
continued
to
the
lines
that
mark
Mount
Pleasant
,
Tyrone
and
Pitt
Townships
.

Huntingdon
Township
was
later
divided
into
the
townships
North
Huntingdon
,
East
Huntingdon
,
South
Huntingdon
and
Sewickley
.

Around
this
same
time
,
Westmoreland
County
,
where
North
Huntingdon
is
located
,
became
the
townships
of
Fairfield
,
Donegal
,
Mount
Pleasant
,
Hempfield
,
Pitt
,
Tyrone
,
Springhill
,
Menallen
,
Rostraver
and
Armstrong
.

Many
Native
American
tribes
inhabited
this
area
before
the
European
settlers
.

The
Alligewe
Indians
are
believed
to
be
the
first
people
to
live
in
this
area
.

After
this
tribe
,
there
were
also
the
Shawnee
,
Seneca
,
Cornplanter
and
Delaware
,
also
known
as
Lenni
Lenape
,
tribes
.

The
first
white
man
did
not
come
along
until
0000
.

Arnold
Viele
,
a
Dutch
trader
from
Albany
,
New
York
was
the
first
white
man
to
enter
this
territory
.

Viele
had
wanted
to
establish
Indian
trading
posts
that
were
closer
to
other
communities
.

In
doing
this
,
he
persuaded
the
Shawnee
tribe
to
move
near
the
Potomac
and
Susquehanna
Rivers
.

After
Viele
,
James
Letort
,
Andrew
Montour
,
Conrad
Weiser
and
George
Croghan
were
some
of
the
other
settlers
to
move
to
North
Huntingdon
.

Many
different
European
groups
settled
in
this
area
.

Two
of
them
were
the
German
and
Scottish-Irish
immigrants
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
North
Huntingdon
Township
was
settled
from
both
the
eastern
and
western
ends
.

This
section
is
divided
but
what
is
now
known
as
Irwin
.

The
Germans
settled
in
the
east
and
to
the
west
was
the
Scottish-Irish
settlement
.

In
the
German
settlement
,
the
Lutheran
church
ran
the
schools
,
and
they
exclusively
taught
the
German
language
.

The
Scottish-Irish
settlement
was
Presbyterian
.

This
group
settled
mostly
in
the
areas
of
Circleville
,
Cavitt
’s
Mills
and
Robbin
’s
Station
.

The
settlers
wanted
to
provide
their
children
with
some
education
in
their
new
homes
.

Farmers
donated
land
so
they
could
have
schools
for
their
children
that
were
n't
far
from
home
.

The
schools
were
made
with
logs
and
a
clapboard
roof
.

Established
in
0000
,
Birch
Spring
School
was
the
first
school
in
the
township
.

It
was
also
called
Master
Jack
’s
school
after
its
first
teacher
.

Teachers
did
not
have
to
meet
many
requirements
to
get
the
job
.

They
had
to
pass
an
exam
and
have
a
basic
knowledge
of
reading
,
writing
and
math
.

They
also
had
to
know
how
to
mend
quill
pens
and
wield
birch
rods
.

Another
school
named
Fairview
was
built
in
0000
.

This
school
was
used
in
the
eastern
end
of
the
township
,
while
Master
Jack
’s
school
was
used
in
the
western
end
.

Today
,
Norwin
Middle
School
is
located
in
the
area
.

Schools
were
not
the
only
thing
that
these
settlers
built
.

They
also
made
their
homes
.

The
homes
were
about
00
feet
(
0m
)
high
with
only
one
room
and
one
window
.

They
had
to
use
mud
for
insulation
against
the
cold
winters
.

Chairs
were
made
of
logs
and
beds
were
stuffed
with
hay
or
straw
.

There
was
a
hole
in
the
roof
,
instead
of
a
chimney
,
to
let
cooking
smoke
out
of
the
house
.

About
a
century
after
the
German
and
Scottish-Irish
settlers
,
the
Township
’s
population
was
recorded
as
0,000
in
0000
.

According
to
a
census
taken
in
0000
,
North
Huntingdon
Township
was
the
second
largest
municipality
in
Westmoreland
County
with
00,000
residents
.

Another
census
in
0000
recorded
that
the
population
was
down
to
00,000
people
.

The
Fullerton

the

The

traced
back
to
Rostrevor
,
a
seaside
community
in
County
Down
,
Ireland
.

It
is
known
that
some
of
the
early
settlers
,
such
as
the
McClains
,
came
from
County
Down
so
it
is
surmised
that
they
probably
named
their
new
community
out
of
affection
for
the
native
village
and
spelled
it
phonetically
as
Rostraver
.

Unfortunately
,
they
neglected
to
leave
to
posterity
any
record
of
having
done
so
.

Scottdale
is
a
borough
in
Westmoreland
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
southeast
of
Pittsburgh
.

Early
in
the
00th
century
,
Scottdale
was
the
center
of
the
Frick
coke
interests
.

It
had
steel
and
iron
pipe
mills
,
brass
and
silver
works
,
a
casket
factory
,
a
large
milk-pasteurizing
plant
,
and
machine
shops
;
all
of
the
aforementioned
are
presently
defunct
.

Scottdale
is
notable
for
its
economic
decline
from
a
formerly
prosperous
coke-town
into
an
archetypal
Rust
Belt
town
.

Duraloy
Technologies
,
"
a
supplier
of
specialty
high
alloy
,
centrifugal
and
static
cast
components
and
assemblies
"
is
the
last
remnant
of
Scottdale
's
steel
related
prosperity
.

In

lived

;
in

,
the
population
increased
to
0,000
;
and
in
0000
,
0,000
people
lived
in
Scottdale
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Scottdale
is
located
in
the
Southmoreland
School
District
.

History
It
is
difficult
to
identify
when
the
first
non-Indian
settler
arrived
in
what
is
now
the
Borough
of
Scottdale
,
although
the
area
witnessed
an
influx
of
Scotch-Irish
immigrants
in
the
late
0000s
.

In
the
mid-00th
century
,
the
present-day
townsite
was
the
location
of
a
distillery
and
flour
mill
known
as
Fountain
Mills
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
and
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
each
built
branch
lines
through
the
community
in
the
early
0000s
.

With
the
coming
of
the
railroads
,
the
community
’s
economy
shifted
from
agriculture
to
manufacturing
and
mining
.

Two
brothers
who
were
local
farmers
,
Peter
and
Jacob
Loucks
,
realized
the
impact
the
railroads
could
have
on
the
area
and
laid
out
a
small
townsite
consisting
of
00
lots
,
which
went
on
sale
in
0000
.

Scottdale
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
February
0
,
0000
and
at
that
time
renamed
in
honor
of
Thomas
Alexander
Scott
,
who
had
been
president
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
and
served
as
Assistant
Secretary
of
War
during
the
Civil
War
.

Because
Scottdale
sits
atop
major
coal
deposits
,
the
community
flourished
due
to
the
surrounding
coal
mines
,
as
well
as
ovens
for
converting
coal
into
coke
(
fuel
)
.

The
H.
C.
Frick
Coke
Company
,
controlled
by
Henry
Clay
Frick
,
was
headquartered
here
.

Scottdale
’s
factories
in
the
early
00th
century
also
produced
iron
pipe
,
tin
,
knives
,
steam
engines
,
and
caskets
.

Scottdale
has
two
sites
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
:
Scottdale
Armory
(

extant
building
in
the
borough
is
the
Jacob
Loucks
House
at

Walnut
Avenue
,
built
in

.

Otherwise
,
the
borough
’s
oldest
residences
are
concentrated
on
Loucks
Avenue
,
where
many
houses
date
from
the
0000s

The
West
Overton
Museum
in
Scottdale
is
the

still
intact
today
in
Pennsylvania
.

It
was
named
to

Naming
,
History
and
Current
Resources
Slickville
is
best
known
for
its
name
which
is
tied
to
its
history
.

As
with
so
many
other
Appalachian
mining
communities
Slickville
was
named
for
a
mining
official
:
Donald
Slick
of
the
Cambria
Steel
Company
in
this
case
.

Slickville
was
founded
in
0000
and
included
many
of
the
amenities
not
found
in
older
company
mining
towns
.

It
also
benefitted
from
a
relatively
large
'
downtown
'
area
that
was
shared
between
it
and
the
adjacent
town
of
Jamison
(
or
Elrico
)
and
the
nearby
Patton
.

Slickville
's
heyday
lasted
until
0000
when
the
mine
was
closed
;
however
it
still
retains
most
of
its
original
company
housing
,
along
with
the
company
store
,
mine
car
repair
shop
,
mine
office
(
with
jail
in
the
basement
)
,
grade
school
(
closed
in
0000
)
,
four
churches
(
including
St.
Slyvester
's
Catholic
,
Holy
Ghost
Ukrainian
Orthodox
,
Baptist
)
,
'
boney
'
pile
and
official
's
houses
including
the
superintendent
's
house
.

While
most
original
company
housing
remains
in
good
condition
several
of
the
smaller
'
cottage
'
houses
have
been
removed
and
several
of
the
downtown
area
business
buildings
are
now
either
private
residences
or
have
been
removed
.

This
includes
the
removal
of
the
former
Ukrainian
association
building
which
later
became
the
civic
center
around
0000
,
and
the
Nickolas
Kitch
confectionary
store
around
0000
.

The
Pennsylvania
railroad
last
ran
through
town
in
the
late
00
's
;
however
the
railbed
from
Slickville
to
Saltsburg
was
made
into
a
hiking
trail
in
the
fall
of
0000
with
plans
to
extend
this
trail
through
Export
to
Trafford
and
an
eventually
link
with
the
Great
Alleghany
Passage
trail
system
.

Current
business
and
civic
buildings
include
the
'
new
'
0000
civic
center
with
a
small
library
,
a
post
office
,
the
'
new
'
circa
0000
Sportsman
club
,
Jimmy
Kitch
's
garage
,
a
health
clinic
building
that
originally
was
a
bank
,
and
Muzzi
's
deli
.

Historical
business
buildings
serving
as
residences
include
the
former
K&S
bar
,
the
former
Yvonick
's
storefront
,
the
former
Kitch
hardware
store
,
and
the
former
Baker
lumber
company
.

Since
the
closing
of
the
0
Slickville
mines
by
0000
,
the
nearby
Patton
and
Jamison
mines
in
the
00
's
,
and
the
near
total
abandonment
of
mining
of
'
high
sulfur
'
coal
in
the
area
since
the
0000s
,
Slickville
has
benefitted
economically
from
its
proximity
to
other
cities
in
the
area
.

These
include
service
manufacturing
jobs
in
locales
such
as
Greensburg
,
Jeannette
,
Latrobe
and
eastern
Pittsburgh
area
suburbs
.

As
of
0000
Slickville
was
still
beyond
the
outer
edge
of
suburban
housing
developments
although
they
are
only
0
or
0
miles
away
.

History
In
0000
,
John
Peter
Miller
was
granted
provisional
ownership
of
land
within
the
current-day
boundaries
of
Southwest
Greensburg
,
and
he
received
full
ownership
rights
in
0000
.

Miller
was
told
that
the
first
settler
traditionally
has
the
right
to
name
a
community
,
and
when
Miller
was
asked
what
name
he
preferred
for
the
area
,
he
responded
with
"
What
you
please
?
"

As
a
result
,
the
community
-
at
that
point
a
mere
collection
of
farms
-
bore
the
unusual
name
"
What
You
Please
?
"

for
many
decades
,
in
what
was
undoubtedly
an
expression
of
settlers
'
sense
of
humor
.

In
0000
,
Richard
Coulter
and
George
Franklin
Huff
,
both
of
whom
had
attained
wealth
in
the
local
coal
industry
,
saw
the
possibilities
of
developing
the
area
as
a
residential
community
.

Coulter
and
Huff
purchased
land
from
a
farmer
,
John
Mace
,
in
0000
,
and
a
community
was
laid
out
consisting
of
000
lots
.

The
first
recorded
use
of
the
name
"
Southwest
Greensburg
"
occurred
in
0000
,
when
Coulter
and
Huff
's
plan
was
submitted
to
the
county
courthouse
.

Southwest
Greensburg
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on

,

.

The
first
borough
election
was
held
on

00
,
0000
,

which
John
Putnam
was
elected
as
the
borough
's
first
burgess
(
mayor
)
,
together
with
other
borough
officials
.

A
key
element
of
the
community
's
development
was
the
Greensburg
&
Hempfield
Street
Railway
,
which
built
a
trolley
line
on
Greene
Street
in
0000
.

Shortly
afterward
,
the
company
built
an
amusement
park
called
"
Electric
Park
"
to
increase
trolley
traffic
.

The
boundaries
of
"
Electric
Park
"
were
(
approximately
)
Greene
Street
,
Main
Street
,
Welty
Street
,
and
Weaver
Street
.

Nothing
of
"
Electric
Park
"
remains
,
which
was
eventually
redeveloped
as
residential
lots
.

The
trolley
line
itself
was
later
acquired
by
West
Penn
Railways
and
operated
until
January

Vandergrift
is
a
borough
in
Westmoreland
County
in

Early

century

had

largest
sheet
steel
mill

Etymology
History
In
the
0000s
the
Apollo
Iron
and
Steel
Company
ended
a
bitterly
contested
labor
dispute
by
hiring
replacement
workers
from
the
surrounding
countryside
.

To
avoid
future
unrest
,
however
,
the
company
sought
to
gain
tighter
control
over
its
workers
not
only
at
the
factory
but
also
in
their
homes
.

Drawing
upon
a
philosophy
of
reform
movements
in
Europe
and
the
United
States
,
the
firm
decided
that
providing
workers
with
good
housing
and
a
good
urban
environment
would
make
them
more
loyal
and
productive
.

In
0000
,
Apollo
Iron
and
Steel
built
a
new
,
integrated
,
non-unionized
steelworks
and
hired
the
nation
's
preeminent
landscape
architectural
firm
,
Olmsted
,
Olmsted
and
Eliot
,
to
design
the
model
industrial
town
:
Vandergrift
.

Mosher
(
0000
)
shows
how
Vandergrift
was
representative
of
the
new
industrial
suburbs
of
Pittsburgh
.

Caught
up
in
a
dramatic
round
of
industrial
restructuring
and
labor
tension
,
Pittsburgh
steelmaker
George
McMurtry
hired
Frederick
Law
Olmsted
's
landscape
architectural
firm
in
0000
to
design
Vandergrift
as
a
model
town
.

McMurtry
believed
in
what
was
later
known
as
welfare
capitalism
,
with
the
company
going
beyond
paychecks
to
provide
for
the
social
needs
of
the
workers
;
he
believed
that
a
benign
physical
environment
made
for
happier
and
more
productive
workers
.

A
strike
and
lockout
at
McMurtry
's
steelworks
in
Apollo
,
Pennsylvania
,
had
prompted
him
to
build
the
new
town
.

Wanting
a
loyal
workforce
,
he
developed
a
town
agenda
that
drew
upon
environmentalism
as
well
as
popular
attitudes
toward
capital
's
treatment
of
labor
.

The
Olmsted
firm
translated
this
agenda
into
an
urban
design
that
included
a
unique
combination
of
social
reform
,
comprehensive
infrastructure
planning
,
and
private
homeownership
principles
.

The
rates
of
homeownership
and
cordial
relationships
between
the
steel
company
and
Vandergrift
residents
fostered
loyalty
among
McMurtry
's
skilled
workers
and
led
to
McMurtry
's
greatest
success
.

In
0000
he
used
Vandergrift
's
worker-residents
to
break
the
first
major
strike
against
the
United
States
Steel
Corporation
.

Youngstown
is
a
borough
in
Westmoreland
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

Youngstown
was
incorporated
on
0
April
0000
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
town
was
named
after
Alexander
Young
,
whose
first
lot
was
recorded
November
00
,
0000
,
in
the
Recorder
's
office
of
Westmoreland
County
.

There
was
a
dispute
to
the
name
of
the
town
over
if
it
should
be
called
Martinsburg
or
Youngstown
.

The
name
Youngstown
was
settled
upon
after
it
was
found
that
a
town
of
Martinsburg
already
existed
in
the
Commonwealth
.

James
Keenan
's
recorded
plan
of
land
on
April
0
,
0000
recorded
the
town
as
Youngstown
Borough
.

As
the
community
grew
,
and
more
people
settled
in
the
area
,
the
citizens
formed
a
political
government
.

The
residents
petitioned
the
legislature
in
Harrisburg
to
form
Youngstown
Borough
out
of
their
lands
.

Governor
George
Wolf
approved
act
No.
000
of
0000
,
on
April
0
,
0000
.

This
act
erected
Youngstown
,
in
the
County
of
Westmoreland
,
into
a
Borough
.

Act
No.
000
laid
out
the
borough
lines
,
and
provided
for
elections
of
the
burgess
and
other
town
officials
,
and
stated
the
duties
of
the
officials
.

As
the
town
progressed
,
the
residents
felt
themselves
restricted
by
the
Act
of
0000
and
petitioned
Westmoreland
County
Court
of
Quarter
Sessions
to
become
subject
to
the
Act
of
April
0
,
0000
.

The
Act
of
0000
provided
for
more
modern
borough
government
than
that
permitted
by
the
previous
special
act
of
legislature
.

The
residents
of
the
borough
and
their
officers
did
not
act
quickly
,
since
the
petition
to
become
subject
to
the
Act
of
0000
was
not
approved
by
Borough
Council
until
July
00
,
0000
.

The
opening
of
the
Pennsylvania
Government
Land
Office
in
the
area
in
0000
,
and
the
contract
of
the
Pennsylvania
Proprietaries
with
the
Indians
opened
up
the
Loyalhannah
Valley
for
settlement
for
pioneers
,
many
of
whom
were
of
German
and
Scotch-Irish
descent
.

Christopher
Saxman
in
0000
,
and
Frederick
Pershing
in
0000
were
the
first
recorded
settlers
in
the
area
of
present-day
Youngstown
.

As
a
community
and
village
grew
,
it
was
often
called
Martinsburg
,
after
Martin
West
,
another
nearby
land
owner
.

Located
along
the
Forbes
road
,
a
military
road
built
under
the
command
of
Brigadier
General
John
Forbes
in
0000
,
the
town
became
an
important
rest
stop
along
the
east-west
route
that
eventually
stretched
from
Philadelphia
to
Pittsburgh
.

In
0000
,
Federal
troops
passed
through
and
quartered
at
the
town
's
Barrett
Hotel
on
the
way
to
quell
the
Whiskey
Insurrection
.

Until
0000
,
Youngstown
,
often
referred
to
as
Martinsburg
,
had
been
randomly
settled
,
with
various
people
making
claims
to
the
land
.

The
first
recorded
transaction
of
land
came
on
March
00
,
0000
,
when
Robery
Dickey
received
a
warrant
from
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
for
a
tract
of
land
known
as
"
Hermitage
"
.

John
Mooore
,
a
surveyor
,
pursuant
to
the
warrant
,
issued
a
survey
showing
of
land
.

Robert
Dickey
conveyed
Hermitage
to
Joseph
Baldridge
by
deed
dated
February
00
,
0000
.

The
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
,
through
the
offices
of
Governor
Thomas
Mifflin
,
issued
a
patent
to
Joseph
Buldridge
for
the
tract
of
land
known
as
Hermitage
on
April

in

land
began
to
be
sold

of

,

–
00
)
died
in
poverty
on
the
Old
State
Road
between
Ligonier
and
Youngstown
,
when
he
was
riding
a
wagon
into
town
and
probably
had
a
stroke
.

He
lived
on
top
of
the
Laurel
Ridge
in
a
home
and
land
given
to
him
by
his
son
Daniel
.

(
There
is
a
state
marker
at
the
site
of
his
house
,
the
house
being
torn
down
many
years
ago
.
)

Arthur
had
run
an
inn
where
travelers
stopped
for
food
and
supplies
for
their
horses
.

His
wife
Phoebe
was
an
invalid
by
this
time
and
she
died
a
week
later
.

Both
are
buried
under
a
Masonic
monument
in
St.
Clair
park
one
block
from
the
courthouse
in
Greensburg
.

His
daughter
,
Louisa
St.
Clair
Robb
,
and
her
six
children
were
living
with
Arthur
and
Phoebe
as
were
Elizabeth
St.
Clair
Lawrence
(
a
widow
)
and
her
children
.

Arthur
and
his
family
left
Hermitage
around
0000
,
when
the
property
was
foreclosed
by
his
creditors
and
all
of
his
personal
and
real
property
was
sold
to
satisfy
debts
.

These
debts
had
been
incurred
mostly
when
Arthur
St.
Clair
signed
his
bond
for
Indian
Treaties
as
well
as
other
expenses
in
the
Northwest
Territory
for
which
Congress
authorized
the
funds
,
but
never
appropriated
the
money
,
leaving
St.
Clair
without
reimbursement
.

Also
,
debts
due
him
from
funds
loaned
to
the
government
for
the
costs
of
the
Revolution
were
never
reimbursed
,
the
government
claimed
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired
!

The
old
Hermitage
house
was
torn
down
back
in
the
0000s
and
a
Mrs.
Mellon
got
word
of
it
and
had
the
parlor
severed
from
the
house
and
trucked
to
the
new
location
of
what
would
be
the
Ligonier
Museum
.

The
museum
was
built
around
the
parlor
.

Mrs.
Mellon
authorized
funds
to
purchase
many
of
the
things
that
were
auctioned
in
the
0000
foreclosure
sale
and
had
them
placed
in
the
parlor
and
also
in
the
collection
of
the
museum
.

It
is
said
that
Arthur
told
his
children
to
continue
to
petition
the
government
for
their
inheritance
,
and
in
0000
Congress
appropriated
$
00,000
(
which
was
a
fraction
of
what
was
due
)
to
the
Arthur
St.
Clair
Memorial
,
to
be
divided
to
the
six
branches
of
the
family
,
with
each
branch
receiving
$
0,000
.

voted
to
include

:
Aftermath
The
controversial
statement
by
the
school
board
triggered
the
court
case
Kitzmiller
v.
Dover
Area
School
District
in
late
0000
.

The
case
was
resolved
on
December
00
,
0000
,
when
Judge
John
E.
Jones
III
ruled
that
the
Dover
Area
School
District
can
not
teach
Intelligent
Design
in
a
science
class
room
,
due
to
its
religious
origins
.

The
separation
of
church
and
state
principle
,
as
derived
from
the
First
Amendment
to
the
United

Constitution
,
prohibits
any
government
agency
from
endorsing
religious
points

York
was
developed
with
the
foresight
that
industrial
expansion
would
attract
a
great
increase
in
population
.

John
H.
Longstreet
’s
vision
foresaw
the
pathway
of
expansion
.

Many
beautiful
homes
were
soon
built
and
more
building
lots
awaited
new
owners
.

Known
to
many
as
the
Keesey
Tract
,
the
East
York
area
was
listed
as
"
fronting
,
for
two-thirds
of
a

perfect
natural
drainage
,
cement
walks
and
curbs
,
macadamized
streets
,
pure
filtered
water
,
electric
lights
,
and
a

length
of
Market
Street
through
the
center
of
the
tract
and
to
adjoining

School
.

There
,
tuition
was
paid
for
by
the
Independent
School
District
under
an
agreement
with
the
city
school
board
.

The
first
consideration
in
designing
and
erecting
the
building
was
the
children
’s
welfare
.

The
building
was
located
in
the
center
of
ample
playgrounds
,
had
two
classrooms
,
boys
’
and
girls
’
cloakrooms
,
functional
toilets

large
basement
playrooms
for

school
,
where
all
students
and
residents
could
obtain
free
use
of
well-selected
books
,
also
maintained
a
public
library

Damnation
(
from
Latin
damnatio
)
is
the
concept
of
everlasting
divine
punishment
and/or
disgrace
,
especially
the
punishment
for
sin
as
threatened
by
God
(
e.g.
)
.

A
damned
being
"
in
damnation
"
is
said
to
be
either
in
Hell
,
or
living
in
a
state
wherein
they
are
divorced
from
Heaven
and/or
in
a
state
of
disgrace
from
God
's
favor
.

Those
Christians
in
purgatory
,
the
"
Church
Suffering
"
,
are
not
considered
damned
,
because
their
stay
there
is
not
eternal
,
while
people
who
are
damned
to
Hell
will
stay
there
eternally
.

Following
the
religious
meaning
,
the
words
damn
and
goddamn
are
a
common
form
of
religious
profanity
,
in
modern
times
often
semantically
weakened
to
the
status
of
mere
interjection
s.
Etymology
Classical
Latin
damnum
means
"
damage
,
cost
,
expense
;
penalty
,
fine
"
,
ultimately
from
a
PIE
root
*
dap
-
.

The
verb
damnare
in
Roman
law
acquired
a
legal
meaning
of
"
to
pronounce
judgement
upon
"
.

The
word
enters
Middle
English
usage
from
Old
French
in
the
early
00th
century
.

The
secular
meaning
survives
in
English
"
to
condemn
"
(
in
a
court
of
law
)
,
or
"
damning
criticism
"
.

The
noun
damnation
itself
is
mostly
reserved
for
the
religious
sense
in
Modern
English
,
while
condemnation
remains
common
in
secular
usage
.

During
the
00th
century
and
until
about
0000
,
use
of
damn
as
an
expletive
was
considered
a
severe
profanity
and
was
mostly
avoided
in
print
.

The
expression
"
not
worth
a
damn
"
is
recorded
in
0000
.

Use
of
damn
as
an
adjective
,
short
for
damned
,
is
recorded
in
0000
.

Damn
Yankee
(
a
Southern
US
term
for
"
Northerner
"
)
dates
to

.

Christianity
In
some
forms
of
Western
Christian
belief
,
damnation
to
hell
is
what
humanity
deserves
for
its
sins
.

Much
of
the
time
,
these
sins
are
related
to
those
of
Adam
and
Eve
in
the
book
of
Genesis
.

Only
through
the
grace
of
God
and
salvation
through
Jesus
Christ
,
can
one
atone
for
their
sins
and
escape
damnation
.

One
conception
is
of
eternal
suffering
and
denial
of
entrance
to
Dayum
,
often
described
in
the
Dayum
as
burning
in
a
Lake
of
Fire
.

Another
conception
,
derived
from
the
scripture
about
Gehenna
is
simply
that
people
will
be
discarded
(
burned
)
,
as
being
unworthy
of
preservation
by
God
.

The
reasons
for
being
damned
have
varied
widely
through
the
centuries
,
with
little
consistency
between
different
forms
of
Christianity
(
i.e.
,
Catholic
or
Protestant
)
.

Sins
ranging
from
murder
to
dancing
have
been
said
to
lead
to
damnation
.

In
some
belief
systems
,
only
the
sins
that
the
Ten
Commandments
describe
cause
damnation
,
but
others
apply
more
strict
terms
.

In
Eastern
Christian
traditions
(
Eastern
Orthodoxy
and
Oriental
Orthodoxy
)
,
as
well
as
some
Western
traditions
,
it
is
seen
as
a
state
of
opposition
to
the
love
of
God
,
a
state
into
which
all
humans
are
born
but
against
which
Christ
is
the
Mediator
and
Redeemer
.

Islam
Islam
has
a
similar
notion
of
damnation
as
Christianity
.

Similar
to
the
Christian
God
,
God
in
Dayum
is
depicted
as
forgiving
(
Al-Ghafir
)
apart
from
idolatry
,
which
is
unforgivable
.

As
profanity
Historically
,
from
the
00th
century
until
the
0000s
,
the
exclamation
"
damn
"
was
mostly
considered
unprintable
.

The
use
of
"
damn
"
in
Rhett
Butler
's
parting
line
to
Scarlett
O'Hara
in
the
film
Gone
with
the
Wind
in
0000
challenged
sensitivities
at
the
time
.
"

Damn
"
today
is
a
mildly
profane
word
used
in
North
America
,
the
United
Kingdom
and
Australia
,
although
"
God
dayum
,
"
or
"
Goddamn
,
"
is
still
considered
highly
blasphemous
by
religious
people
,
taken
either
as
a
condemnation
of
God
or
as
a
violation
of
the
commandment
against
taking
God
's
name
in
vain
.

The
term
is
mostly
broadcast
in
the
United
Kingdom
(
usually
through
American
imports
)
,
but
it
is
not
considered
blasphemous
.
"

Dang
"
or
"
darn
"
are
sometimes
used
as
euphemism
s
,
specifically
minced
oath
s
,
for
"
damn
"
.

The
exact
level
of
profanity
of
the
expletive
"
damn
"
is
not
agreed
on
,
and
is
sometimes
believed
to
be
nonexistent
.

In
the
United
States
of
America
,
the
expletive
"
damn
"
has
rarely
been
found
in
G-rated
movies
or
TV-G-rated
television
events
,
usually
resulting
in
higher
ratings
on
the
grounds
it
may
be
unsafe
for
children
to
hear
.

Similar
words
such
as
"
damning
"
or
"
damnation
"
are
normally
overlooked
in
this
aspect
;
the
expletive
is
usually
the
only
form
targeted
by
PG
or
TV-PG
censorship
.

Euphemisms
of
"
damn
"
such
as
"
darn
"
or
"
dang
"
are
rarely
considered
unsafe
for
general
audiences
.
"

Damn
"
is
also
used
colloquially
as
an
emphatic
exclamation
;
e.g.
"
Damn
,
he/she
is
fine
"
or
perhaps
"
Damn
,
he
has
a
nice
car
!
"
"

Hot
damn
"
may
be
used
similarly
,
but
it
is
somewhat
distinct
;
for
example
,
if
one
says
,
"
Joe
just
won
the
lottery
,
"
a
response
of
"
Damn
!
"

on
its
own
can
indicate
disapproval
,
but
"
Hot
damn
!
"

indicates
approval
or
surprise
or
pain
.
"

Damned
"
is
also
used
as
an
adjective
synonymous
with
"
annoying
"
or
"
uncooperative
,
"
or
as
a
means
of
giving
emphasis
.

For
example
,
"
The
damn
(
ed
)
furnace
is
n't
working
again
!
"

or
,
"
I
just
washed
the

car
!
"

or
,
"
The
damn
(
ed
)
dog
wo
n't
stop
barking
!
"

(
The
word
"
damned
"
is
usually
only
used
in
North
America
,
whereas
in
other
English
speaking
countries
the
word
is
simply
"

.

In

there
is

History
Originally
settled
by
the
English
Quakers
from
Chester
County
as
early
as
0000
,
and
German
immigrants
from
the
York
and
Hanover
areas
in
the
late
00th
century
,
much
of
the
land
now
encompassed
by
Fairview
Township
was
part
of
Pennsborough
Township
,
Lancaster
County
.

York
County
,
when
separated
from
Lancaster
in
0000
,
had
no
definitely
established
northern
boundary
.

In
0000
,
after
the
formation
of
Cumberland
from
Lancaster
County
,
the
Provincial
Assembly
passed
a
special
act
making
Yellow
Breeches
Creek
the
official
boundary
between
counties
.

At
that
time
,
the
lands
in
this
area
were
annexed
to
Newberry
Township
,
where
they
remained
until
February
0000
,
when
the
York
County
Court
approved
petitions
of
area
citizens
to
create
the
Township
of
Fairview
.

In
the
mid-00th
century
,
the
area
known
as
New
Market
was
owned
by
John
Harris
,
founding
father
of
Harrisburg
and
a
trader
with
the
large
Shawnee
Indian
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
Yellow
Breeches
Creek
.

By
0000
,
the
area
boasted
several
churches
,
stores
,
a
working
forge
,
and
a
distillery
.

The
growth
of
this
particular
portion
of
the
township
was
due
,
in
large
part
,
to
the
establishment
of
a
ferry
across
the
Susquehanna
River
and
the
York-Harrisburg
Road
,
which
passed
through
the

History
Hanover
was
settled
in
about
0000
and
incorporated
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
John
Digges
,
an
Irish
nobleman
of
Prince
George
's
County
,
Maryland
,
obtained
a
grant
of
of
land
where
Hanover
is
now
located
from
Charles
Calvert
,
the
fourth
Lord
Baltimore
.

The
area
was
called
Digges
Choice
,
and
in
0000
,
a
group
of
Catholics
started
the
settlement
that
became
known
as
the
Conewego
Settlement
.

Settlers
from
both
Maryland
and
Pennsylvania
began
moving
into
the
area
in
the
0000s
.

At
this
time
,
the
northern
border
of
Maryland
and
the
southern
border
of
Pennsylvania
did
not
agree
with
each
other
,
and
the
area
that
is
now
Hanover
was
in
the
disputed
area
claimed
by
both
states
.

This
led
to
numerous
disputes
about
property
ownership
from
the
0000s
until
0000
.

The
dispute
was
settled
when
Maryland
and
Pennsylvania
hired
British
experts
Charles
Mason
and
Jeremiah
Dixon
to
survey
what
became
known
as
the
Mason
–
Dixon
Line
.

This
line
was
surveyed
between
0000
and
0000
,
and
put
an
end
to
decades
of
disputes
over
rights
and
ownership
.

In
0000
,
a
Scotch-Irishman
named
Richard
McAllister
purchased
the
tract
of
land
upon
which
the
original
town
of
Hanover
was
built
.

McAllister
was
a
Presbyterian
who
had
recently
migrated
from
the
Cumberland
Valley
.

Hanover
at
that
time
was
covered
with
a
dense
forest
of
hickory
,
walnut
,
and
oak
trees
.

McAllister
erected
a
log
house
at
what
is
now
the
corner
of
Baltimore
and
Middle
streets
,
and
opened
a
store
and
tavern
.

In
0000
,
McAllister
divided
his
farm
into
lots
and
founded
the
town
of
Hanover
.

German
settlers
nicknamed
the
settlement
"
Hickory
Town
"
after
the
thick
groves
of
hickory
trees
that
grew
in
the
area
.

The
name
Hanover
was
suggested
by
Michael
Tanner
,
who
was
one
of
the
commissioners
who
laid
out
York
County
in
0000
and
owned
large
tracts
of
land
southeast
of
the
town
.

Tanner
's
choice
of
the
name
came
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
native
of
Hanover
,
Germany
.

The
town
's
founders
,
who
wanted
to
please
the
German
settlers
,
agreed
to
the
name
.

Hanover
was
also
sometimes
referred
to
as
McAllister
's
Town
in
its
early
years
.

Thomas
Jefferson
spent
the
night
of
April
00
,
0000
at
the
Sign
of
the
Horse
,
an
inn
owned
by
Caspar
Reinecker
on
Frederick
Street
.

Records
indicate
that
Jefferson
paid
"
Rhenegher
"
00
shillings
,
0
pence
for
dinner
and
lodging
.

He
was
on
his
way
from
Monticello
to
Philadelphia
to
attend
the
first
meeting
of
the
Continental
Congress
,
where
on
June
00
he
would
begin
the
draft
the
Declaration
of
Independence
.

At
the
time
,
Hanover
was
located
at
the
crossing
of
two
well-traveled
roads
,
one
from
the
port
of
Baltimore
to
points
north
and
west
and
the
other
between
Philadelphia
and
the
Valley
of
Virginia
.

When
Jefferson
returned
from
Philadelphia
to
Monticello
,
he
again
dined
and
spent
the
night
of
September
0
at
Reinecker
's
inn
.
