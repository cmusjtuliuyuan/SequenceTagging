.

It
is

History
Before
the
town
's
founding
in
0000
,
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
right
to
name
the
town
.

The
owner
of
the
First
General
Store
,
owned
by
the
"
White
"
family
,
pushed
for
the
town
to
be
named
Whiteville
.

Shortly
after
his
proposal
,
Deputy
U.S.
Marshall
Arthur
Green
motioned
the
town
be
named
after
a
Cherokee
Chief
named
Wakita
(
pronounced
Wok-ih-taw
)
.

Some
believe
that
Green
wanted
to
name
the
town
in
the
Chief
's
honor
because
of
a
protective
spell
supposedly
cast
to
protect
the
area
around
the
town
from
tornadoes
for
a
time
span
of
000
years
.

This
is
why
Wakita
was
used
in
the
Hollywood
blockbuster
Twister
,
because
of
the
paradox
created
between
the
spell
and
the
movie
setting
.

Citing
historian
George
Shirk
,
the
Encyclopedia
of
Oklahoma
History
and
Culture
states
that
Wakita
is
a
Cherokee
word
for
water
collected
in
a
small
depression
,
such
as
a
buffalo
wallow
.

The
same
source
states
that
Charles
N.
Gould
claimed
that
it
is
probably
a
Creek
word
meaning
to
cry
or
to
lament
.

The
town
began
after
the
Cherokee
Outlet
was
opened
to
non-Indian
settlement
September
00
,
0000
.

A
post
office
opened
November
00
,
0000
.

Population
grew
after
the
Hutchison
and
Southern
Railroad
(
later
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
and
Santa
Fe
Railway
)
built
a
line
through
the
area
in
0000
.

At
statehood
in
0000
,
Wakita
had
000
residents
.

By
0000
,
there
were
000
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
numerous
tornadoes
touched
down
in
Grant
County
,
causing
significant
damage
in
and
near
the
Wakita
area
.

However
,
the
town
itself
was
not
destroyed

was
first
called
"
KeeOtter
"
,
and
was
later
changed
to
"
Keota
"
.

The
town
's
name
may
come
from
a
Choctaw
word
meaning
"
the
fire
gone
out
"
,
referring
to
an
entire
tribe
being
destroyed
by
disease
.

Another
account
is
that
Keota
was
derived
from
"
Jim
Keese
"
,
a
rancher
who
owned
the
land
where
the
townsite
was
located
,
and
"
Otter
,
"
for
Otter
Creek
,
a
tributary
of
the
Sans
Bois
Creek
which
winds
its
way
through
town
.

History
Keota
began
as
a
tent
town

trading
post
,

Valley
Railroad
's

a
lumberyard
.

The
town

local
cotton
growers

a
railroad
shipping
point
for
their
product
.

In

,
the
McClellan
–
Kerr
Arkansas
River
Navigation
System
was
established
on
the
Arkansas
River
,
about
00
miles
north
of
Keota
.

A
dam
on
the
river
created
the
Robert
S.
Kerr
Reservoir
,
which
reach
down
to
Keota
.

This
enabled
the
Port
of
Keota
to
be
established
.

Light
industry
was
beginning
to
be
drawn
to
the
town
at

History
Local
tradition
holds
that

Gerty
was
originally
named
"
Buzzard
Flop
"
.

The
name
was
changed
early
in
the
00th
century
in
an
effort
to
attract
tourism
.

As
tastes
have
changed
,
there
is
currently
a
discussion
among
town
members
of
changing
it
back
for
the
same
reason
.

History
The
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
and
Gulf
Railroad
was
constructed
in
the
0000s
from
Arkansas
to
Indian
Territory
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
the
construction
passed
through
the
Creek
Nation
.

During
this
period
,
a
railroad
camp
was
set
up
to
service
the
railroad
construction
.

The
railroad
workers
called
the
camp
"
Holden
"
in
honor
of
J.F.
Holden
,
the
Auditor
and
Traffic
Manager
of
Choctaw
,
Oklahoma
,
and
Gulf
Railroad
.

In
0000
,
a
request
was
delivered
to
the
U.S.
Congress
to
establish
a
post
office
in
Holden
.

The
request
was
rejected
because
the
name
was
too
similar
to
another
post
office
called
"
Holder
.
"

The
proposed
name
was
then
altered
to
"
Holdenville
"
and
was
accepted
.

In
0000
,
settlers
petitioned
Indian
Territory
to
incorporate
Holdenville
as
a
town
.

A
hearing
was
granted
and
on
November
00
,
0000
,
Holdenville
was
incorporated
as
part
of
Indian
Territory
.

Upon
ratification
in
0000
,
Article

Constitution
designated
Holdenville
as

History
The
town
that
would
later
be
named
Altus
was
founded
in
0000
.

The
community
was
originally
called
Frazer
and
served
as
a
trading
post
until
it
was
relocated
after
an
0000
flood
.

It
was
renamed
Altus
,
a
Latin
word
meaning
"
high
place
"
.

The
city

seen
relatively
steady
growth
since

The
population
doubled
between
the
time
of
Oklahoma
statehood
and
the
0000
census
and
even
increased
during
the
Great
Depression
.

An
irrigation
project
in
the
0000s
and
World
War
II
led
to
further
growth
in
the
town
as
the
nearby
air
field
was
used
to
train
military
pilots
.

Altus
was
an
important

,
which
stretched
from
Wichita
Falls
,
Texas
,
to
Forgan
in
Beaver
County
in
far
northwestern
Oklahoma
.

It
was
later
purchased
by
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
and
since
0000
is
operated
by
the
Wichita
,
Tillman
and
Jackson
Railway
.

In
mathematics
,
especially
homological
algebra
and
other
applications
of
abelian
category
theory
,
the
short
five
lemma
is
a
special
case
of
the
five
lemma
.

It
states
that
for
the
following
commutative
diagram
(
in
any
abelian
category
,
or
in
the
category
of
group
s
)
,
if
the
rows
are
short
exact
sequences
,
and
if
g
and
h
are
isomorphism
s
,
then
f
is
an
isomorphism
as
well
.

It
follows
immediately
from
the
five
lemma
.

The
essence
of
the
lemma
can
be
summarized
as
follows
:
if
you
have
a
homomorphism
f
from
an
object
B
to
an
object
B
′
,
and
this
homomorphism
induces
an
isomorphism
from
a
subobject
A
of
B
to
a
subobject
A
′
of
B
′
and
also
an
isomorphism
from
the
factor
object
B/A
to
B
′
/
A
′
'
,
then
f
itself
is
an
isomorphism
.

Note
however
that
the
existence
of
f
(
such
that
the
diagram
commutes
)
has
to
be
assumed
from
the
start
;
two
objects
B
and
B
′
that
simply
have
isomorphic
sub
-
and
factor
objects
need
not
themselves
be
isomorphic
(
for
example
,
in
the
category
of
abelian
groups
,
B
could
be
the
cyclic
group
of
order
four
and
B
′
the
Klein
four-group
)

Kaw
City
(
Pawnee
:
Arahuuruʾ
,
Arahuúsiriʾ
)
is
a
city
in
Kay
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
,
an
increase
of
0.0
percent
from
000
at
the
0000
census
.

Kaw
City
was
named
for
the
Kanza
Indians
,
called
the
Kaw
by
locals
.

History
In
0000
,
the
original
Kaw
City
was
founded
,
prior
to
Oklahoma
statehood
,
as
a
farming
community
in
the
fertile
oxbow
bend
of
the
Arkansas
River
.

By
statehood
in
0000
,
it
had
000
inhabitants
.

Though
the
original
townsite
is
now
inundated
by
the
waters
of
Kaw
Lake
,
the
old
town
was
quite
a
busy
place
.

It
became
a
booming
oil
town
in
0000
,
when
'
black
gold
'
was
discovered
in
nearby
Kay
County
and
the
present
Osage
Nation
reservation
.

The
population
jumped
from
000
in
0000
to
0,000
in
0000
.

It
even
had
a
very
popular
four-story
hotel
filled
with
one
of
the
world
's
rarest
art
collections
.

Laura
A.
Clubb
,
owner
of
the
collection
and
wife
of
a
local
rancher
,
later
donated
her
collection
to
Philbrook
Art
Museum
.

The
majority
of
the
town
was
overcome
by
a
(
weather
related
)
flood
in
0000
,
and
then
devastated
again
by
the
Great
Depression
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
constructed
Kaw
Dam
on
the
Arkansas
River
just
south
of
the
original
Kaw
City
site
.

It
then
went
underwater
permanently
in
0000
,
when
the
gates
of
the
Kaw
Dam
closed
and
turned
that
particular
area
of
the
Arkansas
River
into
Kaw
Lake
.

Many
buildings
in
Kaw
City
,
including
the
original
Kaw
City
Museum
,
were
moved
to
the
town
's
present
location
,
on
high
ground
near
the
lake
.

When
the
water
in
the
lake
is
exceptionally
low
,
some
of
the
roofs
of
the
old
structures
can
still
be
seen
just
above
the
water
.

The
Kaw
City
Cemetery
(
all
headstones
and
the
majority
of
the
caskets
)
were
also
moved
and
given
a
separate
section
within
Ponca
City
's
IOOF
cemetery
,
west
of
Conoco
just
south
of
Highway
00
.

The
Kaw
Indian
cemetery
located
across
the
Arkansas
river
in
Washunga
was
moved
to
Newkirk
,
Oklahoma
.

The
museum
's
contents
are
now
housed
in
the
old
Santa
Fe
Railroad
Depot
.

Kaw
City
remains
near
Kaw
Lake
,
and
tourism
is
the
major
industry
.

The
town
has
many
retirees
and
part-time
residents
who
take
advantage
of
the
recreational
opportunities
and
the
appealing
natural
landscape
.

county
seat
of
Kay
County
.

History
Newkirk
is
located
on
land
known
as
the
Cherokee
Strip
which
belonged
to
the
Cherokee
Indians
.

In
0000
,
the
Cherokee
sold
the
land
to
the
United
States
government
.

The
land
was
opened
to
White
settlement
by
means
of
the
Cherokee
Strip
Land
Run
on
September
00
,
0000
.

More
than
000,000
people
raced
to
claim
plots
of
land
.

The
town
of
Newkirk
had
been
laid
out
before
the
Run
by
the
government
as
the
county
seat
of
“
K
”
county
.

It
was
named
Lamoreaux
after
Silas
W.
Lamoreaux
who
was
Commissioner
of
the
General
Land
Office
.

Two
miles
north
of
Lamoreaux
was
“
Kirk
”
a
station
of
the
Santa
Fe
Railroad
.

That
first
day
of
the
Land
Run
,
0,000
people
staked
claims
in
and
near
Lamoreaux
.

Claimants
were
allowed
two
town
lots
:
one
for
a
home
and
one
for
a
business
.

In
designated
rural
areas
claimants
could
select
000
acres
.

The
population
quickly
dropped
to
about
0,000
as
disappointed
land
seekers
left
.

A
town
government
was
organized
and
among
the
first
items
of
business
was
to
change
the
name
of
the
town
from
Lamoreaux
to
Santa
Fe
.

The
railroad
,
however
,
did
not
approve
the
name
as
several
other
places
were
named
Santa
Fe
.

Meanwhile
,
the
railroad
station
at
Kirk
had
been
closed
and
so
the
name
“
Newkirk
.

”
was
chosen
on
November
0
,
0000
.

In
0000
,
Newkirk
suffered
a
major
reverse
when
nearly
a
whole
block
of
its
thriving
downtown
burned
.

The
wood
buildings
that
burned
were
mostly
replaced
with
stone
buildings
from
the
distinctive
yellow
limestone
quarried
four
miles
east
of
Newkirk
.

“
Imposing
stone
buildings
began
to
give
dignity
and
permanence
to
the
dusty
streets
while
wood-frame
homes
gradually
replaced
the
“
proving-up
”
homes
of
the
Run
.

Young
Elms
,
Cottonwoods
,
shrubs
,
and
flowers
began
to
change
the
once
treeless
prairies
into
shaded
garden
spots
.

”
Newkirk
’s
business
district
was
placed
on
the
National
Register
as
a
historic
district
in
0000
.

Newkirk
was
also
the
name
of
the
town
in
the
movie
Twister
where
the
drive
in
movie
scene
took
place
.

Even
though
it
was
n't
filmed
in
Newkirk
,
but
in
Guthrie
,
Oklahoma
,
the
directors
took
the
name
from
this
town
.

History
On
September
00
,
0000
,
a
bridge
across
the
Cimarron
River
near
Dover
collapsed
beneath
a
Rock
Island
train
bound
for
Fort
Worth
,
Texas
from
Chicago
.

The
bridge
was
a
temporary
structure
unable
to
withstand
the
pressure
of
debris
and
high
water
.

Replacement
with
a
permanent
structure
had
been
delayed
by
the
railroad
for
financial
reasons
.

Several
sources
report
that
over
000
persons
were
killed
,
although
this
figure
is
disputed
.

The
true
number
may
be
as
low
as
0
.

A
tornado
in

destroyed
about
one-third

Hennessey
is
a
town
in
Kingfisher
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Hennessey
is
named
after
Pat
Hennessy
,
an
Irish
freighter
who
was
killed
at
the
present
townsite
in
April
,
0000
.

He
was
said
to
have
been
burned
on
a
wagon
wheel
,
either
by
native
Cheyenne
tribesmen
or
white
horse
thieves
.

The
Pat
Hennessey
Memorial
Park
can
be
found
at
the
streets
of
Iowa
and
Arapaho
.

The
location
of
his
body
is
another
story
.

Pat
Hennessey
was
originally
buried
next
to
the
location
of
his
death
in
a
shallow
grave
.

Rocks
were
placed
over
his
body
,
and
teamsters
passing
by
would
continue
to
place
markers
on
his
grave
.

At
some
point
in
history
Pat
’s
body
was
moved
.

It
is
possible
Pat
’s
relatives
came
from
Ireland
and
reclaimed
his
body
.

In
any
case
,
it
is
not
at
the
marker
site
at
Memorial
Park
:
excavations
there
produced
no
remains
.

History
The
town
of
Mountain
Park
began
as
a
trading
post
named
Burford
,
near
the
Wichita
Mountains
in

Oklahoma
Territory
.

A

office
was
established
at
Burford
in
August
0000
,
just
after
the
Kiowa
,
Comanche
,
and
Apache
Reservation
for
settlement
.

In
February
0000
,
the
town
that
had
sprung
up
around
the
trading
post
changed
its
name
to
Mountain
Park
.

According
to
Encyclopedia
of

History
and

,
the
Oklahoma
City
and
Western
Railroad
offered
Mountain
View
resident
Sol
Bracken
six
thousand
dollars
for
a
tract
on
which
to
build
a
station
.

Bracken
refused
the
offer
as
insufficient
and
demanded
moe
money
.

Instead
,
company
officials
rerouted
their
railroad
through
the
town
of
Snyder
,
two
miles
south
of
Mountain
Park
.

As
a
result
,
00
of
the
00
businesses
in
Mountain
Park
promptly
moved
to
Snyder
.

By
statehood
in
0000
,
Mountain
Park
had
000
residents
.

In
0000
,
it
was
named
the
county
seat
of
the
short-lived
Swanson
County
,
Oklahoma
.

That
county
was
abolished
in
the
following
year
.

The
local
economy
was
based
on
cotton
and
wheat
production
,
as
well
as
granite
quarrying
.

The
population
rose
to
000
by
0000
.

Census
population
peaked
at
000
in
0000
,
then
declined
to

,
KSWO-TV
reported
that
the
former
town
clerk
was
fired
for
allegedly
secretly
embezzling
$
000,000
over
a
period
of
two
years
,
leaving
the
town
unable
to
pay
its
bills
and
forcing
it

raise
utility
rates

Army
fort
in

,
a

History
In
0000
,
the
Choctaw
Nation
petitioned
the
U.
S.
War
Department
to
construct
a
fort
that
would
stop
the
flow
of
alcohol
and
other
illegal
items
from
flowing
into
their
territory
along
the
Arkansas
River
.

The
garrison
succeeded
in
its
mission
and
also
built
roads
connecting
Fort
Smith
,
Arkansas
,
Fort
Gibson
,
and
Fort
Towson
.

The
army
abandoned
Fort
Coffee
in
0000
when

nation
allowed
the
Methodist
Episcopal
church
to
establish
the
Fort
Coffee
Choctaw
Boys
Academy
in
the
buildings
.

This
school
continued
until

Watie
occupied

site
.

The
Union
Army
recaptured
the

foundation
stones
.

The
Choctaw
were
required
to
release
their
slaves
by
the
Reconstruction
Treaty
of
0000
.

Many

the
freed
men
remained
in
the
Choctaw
Nation
lands
.

Many

these
were
legally
adopted
into
the
Choctaw
Nation
in
0000
,
thus
qualifying
for
land
allotments
by
the
Dawes
Commission
.

A
storm
is
any
disturbed
state
of
an
astronomical
body
's
atmosphere
especially
affecting
its
surface
,
and
strongly
implying
severe
weather
.

It
may
be
marked
by
strong
wind
,
hail
,
thunder
and/or
lightning
(
a
thunderstorm
)
,
heavy
precipitation
(
snowstorm
,
rainstorm
)
,
heavy
freezing
rain
(
ice
storm
)
,
strong
winds
(
tropical
cyclone
,
windstorm
)
,
or
wind
transporting
some
substance
through
the
atmosphere
as
in
a
dust
storm
,
blizzard
,
sandstorm
,
etc.
.

Storms
generally
lead
to
negative
impacts
to
lives
and
property
such
as
storm
surge
,
heavy
rain
or
snow
(
causing
flooding
or
road
impassibility
)
,
lightning
,
wildfire
s
,
and
vertical
wind
shear
;
however
,
systems
with
significant
rainfall
can
alleviate
drought
in
places
they
move
through
.

Heavy
snowfall
can
allow
special
recreational
activities
to
take
place
which
would
not
be
possible
otherwise
,
such
as
skiing
and
snowmobiling
.

The
English
word
comes
from
Proto-Germanic
*
sturmaz
meaning
"
noise
,
tumult
"
.

Formation
Storms
are
created
when
a
center
of
low
pressure
develops
with
a
system
of
high
pressure
surrounding
it
.

This
combination
of
opposing
forces
can
create
winds
and
result
in
the
formation
of
storm
clouds
,
such
as
the
cumulonimbus
.

Small
localized
areas
of
low
pressure
can
form
from
hot
air
rising
off
hot
ground
;
resulting
in
smaller
disturbances
such
as
dust
devils
and
whirlwinds
.

Types
There
are
many
varieties
and
names
for
storms
.

Classification
A
strict
meteorological
definition
of
a
terrestrial
storm
is
a
wind
measuring
00
or
higher
on
the
Beaufort
scale
,
meaning
a
wind
speed
of
00.0
m/s
(
00
km/h
,
00
mph
)
or
more
;
however
,
popular
usage
is
not
so
restrictive
.

Storms
can
last
anywhere
from
00
to
000
hours
,
depending
on
season
and
geography
.

The
east
and
northeast
storms
are
noted
for
the
most
frequent
repeatability
and
duration
,
especially
during
the
cold
period
.

Big
terrestrial
storms
alter
the
oceanographic
conditions
that
in
turn
may
affect
food
abundance
and
distribution
:
strong
currents
,
strong
tides
,
increased
siltation
,
change
in
water
temperatures
,
overturn
in
the
water
column
,
etc.
.

Extraterrestrial
storms
Storms
are
not
unique
to
Earth
;
other
planetary
bodies
with
a
sufficient
atmosphere
(
gas
giant
s
in
particular
)
also
undergo
stormy
weather
.

A
famous
example
is
the
Great
Red
Spot
on
Jupiter
.

Though
technically
an
anticyclone
with
greater
than
hurricane
wind
speeds
,
it
is
larger
than
the
earth
and
has
been
raging
for
at
least
000
years
,
having
first
been
observed
by
astronomer
Galileo
Galilei
.

Neptune
also
had
its
own
lesser
known
Great
Dark
Spot
.

In
September
0000
Hubble
telescope
using
Wide
Field
Planetary
Camera
0
imaged
the
storms
on
Saturn
,
generated
by
upwelling
of
warmer
air
,
similar
to
a
terrestrial
thunderhead
.

The
east-west
extent
of
the
same-year
storm
was
equal
to
the
diameter
of
Earth
.

The
storm
was
observed
earlier
in
September
0000
and
acquired
the
name
Dragon
Storm
.

The
dust
storms
of
Mars
are
variable
in
size
,
but
can
often
cover
the
entire
planet
.

They
tend
to
occur
when
Mars
is
closest
to
the
Sun
,
and
have
been
shown
to
increase
the
global
temperature
.

One
particularly
large
extraterrestrial
storm
was
exhaustively
studied
up
close
simply
due
to
coincidental
timing
.

When
the
first
spacecraft
to
be
successfully
put
into
orbit
around
another
planet
,
Mariner
0
,
arrived
and
successfully
orbited
Mars
on
00
November
0000
,
planetary
scientists
were
surprised
to
find
the
atmosphere
was
thick
with
"
a
planet-wide
robe
of
dust
,
the
largest
storm
ever
observed
.
"

The
surface
was
totally
obscured
.

Mariner
0
's
computer
was
reprogrammed
from
Earth
to
delay
imaging
of
the
surface
for
a
couple
of
months
until
the
dust
settled
.

However
,
the
surface-obscured
images
contributed
much
to
the
collection
of
Mars
atmospheric
and
planetary
surface
science
.

Two
known
extrasolar
planet
s
have
known
to
be
possess
storms
:
HD
000000
b
and
HD
00000
b
.

The
former
's
storm
was
discovered
on
June
00
,
0000
and
measured
at
0,000
km/h
,
while
the
latter
has
shockwave
storms
whipping
around
the
planet
in
00
hours
.

Effects
on
human
society
Shipwrecks
are
common
with
the
passage
of
strong
tropical
cyclones
.

Such
shipwrecks
can
change
the
course
of
history
,
as
well
as
influence
art
and
literature
.

A
hurricane
led
to
a
victory
of
the
Spanish
over
the
French
for
control
of
Fort
Caroline
,
and
ultimately
the
Atlantic
coast
of
North
America
,
in
0000
.

Strong
wind
s
from
any
storm
type
can
damage
or
destroy
vehicles
,
buildings
,
bridges
,
and
other
outside
objects
,
turning
loose
debris
into
deadly
flying
projectiles
.

In
the
United
States
,
major
hurricanes
comprise
just
00
%
of
all
landfalling
tropical
cyclones
,
but
account
for
00
%
of
all
damage
.

Tropical
cyclones
often
knock
out
power
to
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
,
preventing
vital
communication
and
hampering
rescue
efforts
.

Tropical
cyclones
often
destroy
key
bridges
,
overpasses
,
and
roads
,
complicating
efforts
to
transport
food
,
clean
water
,
and
medicine
to
the
areas
that
need
it
.

Furthermore
,
the
damage
caused
by
tropical
cyclones
to
buildings
and
dwellings
can
result
in
economic
damage
to
a
region
,
and
to
a
diaspora
of
the
population
of
the
region
.

The
storm
surge
,
or
the
increase
in
sea
level
due
to
the
cyclone
,
is
typically
the
worst
effect
from
landfalling
tropical
cyclones
,
historically
resulting
in
00
%
of
tropical
cyclone
deaths
.

The
relatively
quick
surge
in
sea
level
can
move
miles/kilometers
inland
,
flooding
homes
and
cutting
off
escape
routes
.

The
storm
surges
and
winds
of
hurricanes
may
be
destructive
to
human-made
structures
,
but
they
also
stir
up
the
waters
of
coastal
estuaries
,
which
are
typically
important
fish
breeding
locales
.

Cloud-to-ground
lightning
frequently
occur
within
the
phenomena
of
thunderstorms
and
have
numerous
hazards
towards
landscapes
and
populations
.

One
of
the
more
significant
hazards
lightning
can
pose
is
the
wildfires
they
are
capable
of
igniting
.

Under
a
regime
of
low
precipitation
(
LP
)
thunderstorms
,
where
little
precipitation
is
present
,
rainfall
can
not
prevent
fires
from
starting
when
vegetation
is
dry
as
lightning
produces
a
concentrated
amount
of
extreme
heat
.

Wildfires
can
devastate
vegetation
and
the
biodiversity
of
an
ecosystem
.

Wildfires
that
occur
close
to
urban
environments
can
inflict
damages
upon
infrastructures
,
buildings
,
crops
,
and
provide
risks
to
explosions
,
should
the
flames
be
exposed
to
gas
pipes
.

Direct
damage
caused
by
lightning
strikes
occurs
on
occasion
.

In
areas
with
a
high
frequency
for
cloud-to-ground
lightning
,
like
Florida
,
lightning
causes
several
fatalities
per
year
,
most
commonly
to
people
working
outside
.

Precipitation
with
low
potential
of
hydrogen
levels
(
pH
)
,
otherwise
known
as
acid
rain
,
is
also
a
frequent
risk
produced
by
lightning
.

Distilled
water
,
which
contains
no
carbon
dioxide
,
has
a
neutral
pH
of
0
.

Liquids
with
a
pH
less
than
0
are
acidic
,
and
those
with
a
pH
greater
than
0
are
bases
.

“
Clean
”
or
unpolluted
rain
has
a
slightly
acidic
pH
of
about
0.0
,
because
carbon
dioxide
and
water
in
the
air
react
together
to
form
carbonic
acid
,
a
weak
acid
(
pH
0.0
in
distilled
water
)
,
but
unpolluted
rain
also
contains
other
chemicals
.

Nitric
oxide
present
during
thunderstorm
phenomena
,
caused
by
the
splitting
of
nitrogen
molecules
,
can
result
in
the
production
of
acid
rain
,
if
nitric
oxide
forms
compounds
with
the
water
molecules
in
precipitation
,
thus
creating
acid
rain
.

Acid
rain
can
damage
infrastructures
containing
calcite
or
other
solid
chemical
compounds
containing
carbon
.

In
ecosystems
,
acid
rain
can
dissolve
plant
tissues
of
vegetations
and
increase
acidification
process
in
bodies
of
water
and
in
soil
,
resulting
in
deaths
of
marine
and
terrestrial
organisms
.

Hail
damage
to
roofs
often
goes
unnoticed
until
further
structural
damage
is
seen
,
such
as
leaks
or
cracks
.

It
is
hardest
to
recognize
hail
damage
on
shingled
roofs
and
flat
roofs
,
but
all
roofs
have
their
own
hail
damage
detection
problems
.

Metal
roofs
are
fairly
resistant
to
hail
damage
,
but
may
accumulate
cosmetic
damage
in
the
form
of
dents
and
damaged
coatings
.

Hail
is
also
a
common
nuisance
to
drivers
of
automobiles
,
severely
denting
the
vehicle
and
cracking
or
even
shattering
windshields
and
windows
.

Rarely
,
massive
hailstones
have
been
known
to
cause
concussion
s
or
fatal
head
trauma
.

Hailstorms
have
been
the
cause
of
costly
and
deadly
events
throughout
history
.

One
of
the
earliest
recorded
incidents
occurred
around
the
0th
century
in
Roopkund
,
Uttarakhand
,
India
.

The
largest
hailstone
in
terms
of
diameter
and
weight
ever
recorded
in
the
United
States
fell
on
July
00
,
0000
in
Vivian
,
South
Dakota
in
the
United
States
;
it
measured
in
diameter
and
in
circumference
,
weighing
in
at
.

This
broke
the
previous
record
for
diameter
set
by
a
hailstone
0
inches
diameter
and
00.00
inches
circumference
which
fell
in
Aurora
,
Nebraska
in
the
United
States
on
June
00
,
0000
,
as
well
as
the
record
for
weight
,
set
by
a
hailstone
of
that
fell
in
Coffeyville
,
Kansas
in
0000
.

Various
hazards
,
ranging
from
hail
to
lightning
can
have
an
impact
on
outside
technology
facilities
,
such
as
antennas
,
satellite
dishes
,
and
towers
.

As
a
result
,
companies
with
outside
facilities
have
begun
installing
such
facilities
underground
,
in
order
to
reduce
the
risk
of
damage
from
storms
.

Substantial
snowfall
can
disrupt
public
infrastructure
and
services
,
slowing
human
activity
even
in
regions
that
are
accustomed
to
such
weather
.

Air
and
ground
transport
may
be
greatly
inhibited
or
shut
down
entirely
.

Populations
living
in
snow-prone
areas
have
developed
various
ways
to
travel
across
the
snow
,
such
as
ski
s
,
snowshoe
s
,
and
sled
s
pulled
by
horses
,
dogs
,
or
other
animals
and
later
,
snowmobile
s.
Basic
utilities
such
as
electricity
,
telephone
line
s
,
and
gas
supply
can
also
fail
.

In
addition
,
snow
can
make
roads
much
harder
to
travel
and
vehicles
attempting
to
use
them
can
easily
become
stuck
.

The
combined
effects
can
lead
to
a
"
snow
day
"
on
which
gatherings
such
as
school
,
work
,
or
church
are
officially
canceled
.

In
areas
that
normally
have
very
little
or
no
snow
,
a
snow
day
may
occur
when
there
is
only
light
accumulation
or
even
the
threat
of
snowfall
,
since
those
areas
are
unprepared
to
handle
any
amount
of
snow
.

In
some
areas
,
such
as
some
states
in
the
United
States
,
schools
are
given
a
yearly
quota
of
snow
days
(
or
"
calamity
days
"
)
.

Once
the
quota
is
exceeded
,
the
snow
days
must
be
made
up
.

In
other
states
,
all
snow
days
must
be
made
up
.

For
example
,
schools
may
extend
the
remaining
school
days
later
into
the
afternoon
,
shorten
spring
break
,
or
delay
the
start
of
summer
vacation
.

Accumulated
snow
is
removed
to
make
travel
easier
and
safer
,
and
to
decrease
the
long-term
impact
of
a
heavy
snowfall
.

This
process
utilizes
shovel
s
and
snowplow
s
,
and
is
often
assisted
by
sprinkling
salt
or
other
chloride-based
chemicals
,
which
reduce
the
melting
temperature
of
snow
.

In
some
areas
with
abundant
snowfall
,
such
as
Yamagata
Prefecture
,
Japan
,
people
harvest
snow
and
store
it
surrounded
by
insulation
in
ice
houses
.

This
allows
the
snow
to
be
used
through
the
summer
for
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
,
which
requires
far
less
electricity
than
traditional
cooling
methods
.

Agriculture
Hail
can
cause
serious
damage
,
notably
to
automobile
s
,
aircraft
,
skylights
,
glass-roofed
structures
,
livestock
,
and
most
commonly
,
farmers
'
crops
.

Wheat
,
corn
,
soybeans
,
and
tobacco
are
the
most
sensitive
crops
to
hail
damage
.

Hail
is
one
of
Canada
's
most
expensive
hazards
.

Snowfall
can
be
beneficial
to
agriculture
by
serving
as
a
thermal
insulator
,
conserving
the
heat
of
the
Earth
and
protecting
crops
from
subfreezing
weather
.

Some
agricultural
areas
depend
on
an
accumulation
of
snow
during
winter
that
will
melt
gradually
in
spring
,
providing
water
for
crop
growth
.

If
it
melts
into
water
and
refreezes
upon
sensitive
crops
,
such
as
oranges
,
the
resulting
ice
will
protect
the
fruit
from
exposure
to
lower
temperatures
.

Although
tropical
cyclone
s
take
an
enormous
toll
in
lives
and
personal
property
,
they
may
be
important
factors
in
the
precipitation
regimes
of
places
they
affect
and
bring
much-needed
precipitation
to
otherwise
dry
regions
.

Hurricanes
in
the
eastern
north
Pacific
often
supply
moisture
to
the
Southwestern
United
States
and
parts
of
Mexico
.

Japan
receives
over
half
of
its
rainfall
from
typhoons
.

Hurricane
Camille
averted
drought
conditions
and
ended
water
deficits
along
much
of
its
path
,
though
it
also
killed
000
people
and
caused
$
0.00
billion
(
0000
USD
)
in
damage
.

Aviation
Hail
is
one
of
the
most
significant
thunderstorm
hazards
to
aircraft
.

When
hail
stones
exceed
in
diameter
,
planes
can
be
seriously
damaged
within
seconds
.

The
hailstones
accumulating
on
the
ground
can
also
be
hazardous
to
landing
aircraft
.

Strong
wind
outflow
from
thunderstorms
causes
rapid
changes
in
the
three-dimensional
wind
velocity
just
above
ground
level
.

Initially
,
this
outflow
causes
a
headwind
that
increases
airspeed
,
which
normally
causes
a
pilot
to
reduce
engine
power
if
they
are
unaware
of
the
wind
shear
.

As
the
aircraft
passes
into
the
region
of
the
downdraft
,
the
localized
headwind
diminishes
,
reducing
the
aircraft
's
airspeed
and
increasing
its
sink
rate
.

Then
,
when
the
aircraft
passes
through
the
other
side
of
the
downdraft
,
the
headwind
becomes
a
tailwind
,
reducing
lift
generated
by
the
wings
,
and
leaving
the
aircraft
in
a
low-power
,
low-speed
descent
.

This
can
lead
to
an
accident
if
the
aircraft
is
too
low
to
effect
a
recovery
before
ground
contact
.

As
the
result
of
the
accidents
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
in
0000
the
U.S.
Federal
Aviation
Administration
mandated
that
all
commercial
aircraft
have
on-board
wind
shear
detection
systems
by
0000
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
wind
shear
directly
caused
or
contributed
to
00
major
civil
transport
aircraft
accidents
in
the
U.S.
that
led
to
000
deaths
and
000
injuries
.

Since
0000
,
the
number
of
major
civil
aircraft
accidents
caused
by
wind
shear
has
dropped
to
approximately
one
every
ten
years
,
due
to
the
mandated
on-board
detection
as
well
as
the
addition
of
Doppler
weather
radar
units
on
the
ground
.

Recreation
Many
winter
sports
,
such
as
skiing
,
snowboarding
,
snowmobiling
,
and
snowshoe
ing
depend
upon
snow
.

Where
snow
is
scarce
but
the
temperature
is
low
enough
,
snow
cannon
s
may
be
used
to
produce
an
adequate
amount
for
such
sports
.

Children
and
adults
can
play
on
a
sled
or
ride
in
a
sleigh
.

Although
a
person
's
footsteps
remain
a
visible
within
a
snow-covered
landscape
,
snow
cover
is
considered
a
general
danger
to
hiking
since
the
snow
obscures
landmarks
and
makes
the
landscape
itself
appear
uniform
.

Notable
storms
in
art
and
culture
In
mythology
and
literature
According
to
the
Bible
,
a
giant
storm
sent
by
God
flooded
the
Earth
.

Noah
and
his
family
and
the
animals
entered
the
Ark
,
and
"
the
same
day
were
all
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
broken
up
,
and
the
windows
of
heaven
were
opened
,
and
the
rain
was
upon
the
earth
forty
days
and
forty
nights
.
"

The
flood
covered
even
the
highest
mountains
to
a
depth
of
more
than
twenty
feet
,
and
all
creatures
died
;
only
Noah
and
those
with
him
on
the
Ark
were
left
alive
.

In
the
New
Testament
,
Jesus
Christ
is
recorded
to
have
calmed
a
storm
on
the
Sea
of
Galilee
.

The
Gilgamesh
flood
myth
is
a
deluge
story
in
the
Epic
of
Gilgamesh
.

In
Greek
mythology
there
were
several
gods
of
storms
:
Briareos
,
the
god
of
sea
storms
;
Aigaios
,
a
god
of
the
violent
sea
storms
;
and
Aiolos
,
keeper
of
storm-winds
,
squalls
and
tempests
.

The
Sea
Venture
was
wrecked
near
Bermuda
in
0000
,
which
led
to
the
colonization
of
Bermuda
and
provided
the
inspiration
for
Shakespeare
's
play
The
Tempest
(
0000
)
.

Specifically
,
Sir
Thomas
Gates
,
future
governor
of
Virginia
,
was
on
his
way
to
England
from
Jamestown
,
Virginia
.

On
Saint
James
Day
,
while
he
was
between
Cuba
and
the
Bahamas
,
a
hurricane
raged
for
nearly
two
days
.

Though
one
of
the
small
vessels
in
the
fleet
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
Florida
Straits
,
seven
of
the
remaining
vessels
reached
Virginia
within
several
days
after
the
storm
.

The
flagship
of
the
fleet
,
known
as
Sea
Adventure
,
disappeared
and
was
presumed
lost
.

A
small
bit
of
fortune
befell
the
ship
and
her
crew
when
they
made
landfall
on
Bermuda
.

The
vessel
was
damaged
on
a
surrounding
coral
reef
,
but
all
aboard
survived
for
nearly
a
year
on
the
island
.

The
British
colonists
claimed
the
island
and
quickly
settled
Bermuda
.

In
May
0000
,
they
set
forth
for
Jamestown
,
this
time
arriving
at
their
destination
.

The
children
's
novel
The
Wonderful
Wizard
of
Oz
,
written
by
L.
Frank
Baum
and
illustrated
by
W.
W.
Denslow
,
chronicles
the
adventures
of
a
young
girl
named
Dorothy
Gale
in
the
Land
of
Oz
,
after
being
swept
away
from
her
Kansas
farm
home
in
a
tornado
.

The
story
was
originally
published
by
the
George
M.
Hill
Company
in
Chicago
on
May
00
,
0000
and
has
since
been
reprinted
numerous
times
,
most
often
under
the
name
The
Wizard
of
Oz
,
and
adapted
for
use
in
other
media
.

Thanks
in
part
to
the
0000
MGM
movie
,
it
is
one
of
the
best-known
stories
in
American
popular
culture
and
has
been
widely
translated
.

Its
initial
success
,
and
the
success
of
the
popular
0000
Broadway
musical
which
Baum
adapted
from
his
original
story
,
led
to
Baum
's
writing
thirteen
more
Oz
books
.

Hollywood
director
King
Vidor
(
February
0
,
0000
–
November
0
,
0000
)
survived
the
Galveston
Hurricane
of
0000
as
a
boy
.

Based
on
that
experience
,
he
published
a
fictionalized
account
of
that
cyclone
,
titled
"
Southern
Storm
"
,
for
the
May
0000
issue
of
Esquire
magazine
.

Erik
Larson
excerpts
a
passage
from
that
article
in
his
0000
book
,
Isaac
's
Storm
:
Numerous
other
accounts
of
the
Galveston
Hurricane
of
0000
have
been
made
in
print
and
in
film
.

Larson
cites
many
of
them
in
Isaac
's
Storm
,
which
centrally
features
that
storm
,
as
well
as
chronicles
the
creation
of
the
Weather
Bureau
(
which
came
to
known
as
the
National
Weather
Service
)
and
that
agency
's
fateful
rivaly
with
the
weather
service
in
Cuba
,
and
a
number
of
other
major
storms
,
such
as
those
which
ravaged
Indianola
,
Texas
in
0000
and
0000
.

The
Great
Storm
of
0000
is
key
in
an
important
scene
near
the
end
of
Possession
:
A
Romance
,
the
bestselling
and
Man
Booker
Prize
-
winning
novel
by
A.
S.
Byatt
.

The
Great
Storm
of
0000
occurred
on
the
night
of
October
00
–
00
,
0000
,
when
an
unusually
strong
weather
system
caused
winds
to
hit
much
of
southern
England
and
northern
France
.

It
was
the
worst
storm
to
hit
England
since
the
Great
Storm
of
0000
(
000
years
earlier
)
and
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
at
least
00
people
in
England
and
France
combined
(
00
in
England
,
at
least
four
in
France
)
.

Hurricane
Katrina
(
0000
)
has
been
featured
in
a
number
of
works
of
fiction
.

In
fine
art
The
Romantic
seascape
painters
J.
M.
W.
Turner
and
Ivan
Aivazovsky
created
some
of
the
most
lasting
impressions
of
the
sublime
and
stormy
seas
that
are
firmly
imprinted
on
the
popular
mind
.

Turner
's
representations
of
powerful
natural
forces
reinvented
the
traditional
seascape
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
.

Upon
his
travels
to
Holland
,
he
took
note
of
the
familiar
large
rolling
waves
of
the
English
seashore
transforming
into
the
sharper
,
choppy
waves
of
a
Dutch
storm
.

A
characteristic
example
of
Turner
’s
dramatic
seascape
is
The
Slave
Ship
of
0000
.

Aivazovsky
left
several
thousand
turbulent
canvases
in
which
he
increasingly
eliminated
human
figures
and
historical
background
to
focus
on
such
essential
elements
as
light
,
sea
,
and
sky
.

His
grandiose
Ninth
Wave
(
0000
)
is
an
ode
to
human
daring
in
the
face
of
the
elements
.

The
0000

The
Johnstown
Flood
features
the
Great

The
flood
,
caused
by
the
catastrophic
failure
of
the
South
Fork
Dam
after
days
of
extremely
heavy

,
prompted
the

The

)
,
as

feature
the

The

,
was
a
nor'easter
that

Hurricane

and
ultimately
evolved
into
a

,
and
officially
started
that

wagon
.

Soon
he
took
on
a
partner
,
Benjamin
Ryland
,
and
the
two
moved
into
a
log
cabin
.

A

christened
"
Crescent
City

,
the
name
taken

began
.

In

the
town
site
was
platted
,

capital
of
the
new
Territory
of
Oklahoma
.

Within
months
,
Guthrie
became
a
modern
brick
and
stone
"
Queen
of
the
Prairie
"
with
municipal
water
,
electricity
,
a
mass
transit
system
,
and
underground
parking
garages
for
horses
and
carriages
.

Hobart
Johnstone
Whitley
,
also
known
as
HJ
and
the
Father
of
Hollywood
,
was
the
first
president
of
the
Guthrie
Chamber
of
Commerce
.

Whitley
built
the
first
brick
block
building
in
the
territory
for
his
National
Loan
&
Trust
Company
.

He
was
asked
by
the
local
people
to
be
the
first
Governor
of
Oklahoma
.

Whitley
traveled
to
Washington
,
D.C.
where
he
persuaded
the
U.S.
Congress
to
allow
Guthrie
to
be
the
new
capital
of
the
state
of
Oklahoma
.

This
was
specified
in
the
0000
Oklahoma
Enabling
Act
that
established
certain
requirements
for
the
new
state
constitution
.

By
0000
,
when
Guthrie
became
the
capital
,
it
looked
like
a
well
established
Eastern
city
.

Guthrie
prospered
briefly
as
the
administrative
center
of
the
territory
,
but
was
eclipsed
in
economic
influence
by
Oklahoma
City
early
in
the
00th
century
.

Oklahoma
City
had
managed
to
become
a
major
junction
for
several
railroads
and
had
attracted
a
major
industry
in
the
form
of
meat
packing
.

Oklahoma
City
business
leaders
began
campaigning
soon
after
statehood
to
make
Oklahoma
City
the
new
state
capital
,
and
in
0000
a
special
election
was
held
to
determine
the
location
of
the
state
capital
.

00,000
votes
were
cast
for
Oklahoma
City
;
00,000
for
Guthrie
;
and
0,000
for
Shawnee
.

Governor
Charles
N.
Haskell
,
who
was
in
Tulsa
on
the
day
of
the
election
,
ordered
his
secretary
W.B.
Anthony
to
have
Oklahoma
Secretary
of
State
Bill
Cross
obtain
the
state
seal
and
transport
it
to
Oklahoma
City
despite
having
been
served
a
restraining
order
by
Logan
County
Sheriff
John
Mahoney
blocking
the
transfer
.

Anthony
obtained
written
authorization
from
Cross
,
retrieved
the
seal
from
the
Logan
County
courthouse
,
and
delivered
it
to
Oklahoma
City
.

After
the
move
of
the
capital
,
Guthrie
began
to
dwindle
in
size
and
soon
lost
its
status
as
Oklahoma
's
second
largest
city
,
first
to
Muskogee
,
then
later
to
Tulsa
.

The
move
was
upheld
by
the
Oklahoma
Supreme
Court
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
by
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
in
0000
.

Guthrie
was
designated
a
National
Historic
Landmark
by
the
National
Park
Service
in
0000
.

today
As
a
result
of
Guthrie
's
early
loss
of
prominence
,
it
remains
as
a
well-preserved
Victorian
enclave
.

Whereas
growth
and
inattentive
urban
planning
caused
other
Oklahoma
towns
such
as
Oklahoma
City
to
destroy
much
of
their
early
downtown
architecture
,
much
of
the
entire
central

of
Guthrie
is
intact

History
Marshall
began
as
a
community
when
the
Unassigned
Lands
were
opened
for
settlement
in

.

Sylvan
T.
Rice
opened

Rice
was
from

He
also
opened

The
town
boomed
after
the
opening
of

built
a
track

Famous
Oklahoma
author
Dr.
Angie
Debo
was
from
Marshall
,
Oklahoma
.

She
died
in
0000
.

She
has
written
many
books
about
the
fate
of
Indians
.

Her
portrait
hangs
in
the
Oklahoma
Capitol
.

Miss
Debo
wrote
a
book
called
Prairie
City
which
was
loosely
based
on
Marshall
.

Marshall
started
a
town
celebration
in
0000
in
honor
of
Miss
Debo
called
Prairie
City
Days
.

Marshall
was
known
as
the
school
band
"
capital
"
of
the
world
in
the
0000s
.

Area
schools
would
come
to
compete
and
march
down
main
street
.

It
was
known
as
"
The
Biggest
Little
Band
Festival
in
the
World
"
and
was
held
from
0000
to
0000
.

It
was
founded
by
Tibby
Shades
(
school
superintendent
)
and
Ashley
Alexander
Sr.
(
band
director
)
.

It
was
cancelled
in
0000
due
to
the
state
band
contest
being
scheduled
on
the
same
date
and
was
never
revived
.

It
grew
to
such
magnitude
that
WKY
radio
out
of
Oklahoma
City
broadcast
the
marching
band
performances
held
on
main
street
.

The
Oklahoma
Highway
Patrol
increased
participation
on
festival
day
to
assist
with
the
traffic
situation
.

Fifty-Seven
towns
converged
on
Marshall
in
0000
to
participate
in
the
festival
with
sixty-five
performing
groups
.

It
is
believed
0,000
participated
in
the
0000
festival
.

Marshall
's
two-story
brick
school
was
built
in
0000
and
in
the
0000s
the
second
story
was
torn
down
and
classes
was
built
around
the
first
story
.

Marshall
's
had
its
last
high
school
graduating
class
in
0000
.

It
continued
as
a
middle
school
(
grades
0
–
0
)
until
0000
when
the
school
closed
its
doors
for
good
.

Today
most
of
the
roof
has
fallen
in
.

The
gymnasium
is
the
only
part
of
the
school
that
is
still
in
good
shape
.

Today
it
is
used
for
the
annual
volunteer
firemen
's
rib
dinner
.

People
come
from
all
around
to
attend
and
it
averages
over
0000
people
.

Marshall
is
said
to
have
the
widest
main
street
in
the
USA
.

It
is
said
that
a
team
of
horses
made
a
"
U
"
turn
and
that
determined
how
wide
they
made
main
street
.

Also
,
it
is
said
that
when
the
town
was
moved
0/0
mile
west
in
order
to
be
located
adjacent
to
the
railroad
,
the
city
fathers
,
when
laying
out
the
town
site
,
decided
to
make
the
streets
wide
enough
to
accommodate
angle
parking
at
the
curbs
,
two
lanes
of
traffic
,
and
sufficient
room
for
street
cars
.

It
was
thought
if
Marshall
should
ever
become
a
large
city
like
Chicago
that
having
the
streets
wide
enough
would
be
of
great
benefit
.

The
main
street
lacks
six
feet
being
as
wide
as
a
football
field
which
was
perfect
for
marching
band
performances
during
the
band
festival
.

Outlaw
Dick
Yeager
alias
Zip
Wyatt
was
shot
and
killed
SW
of
Marshall
.

Miss
Debo
wrote
in
one
of
her
books
that
the
Dalton
gang
stopped
in
one
time
and
bought
supplies
from
the
general
merchandise
store
and
left
with
no
problems
.

There
are
two
cemeteries
in
Marshall
.

One
that
used
to
be
called
Pleasant
Ridge
or
today
called
South
Marshall
IOOF
and
the
North
Marshall
IOOF
.

Mulhall
is
a
town
in
Logan
and
Payne
counties
in
the
U.S.
state
of
Oklahoma
.

The
population
was
000
at

0000
census
,
down
0.0
percent
from
000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Oklahoma
City
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

History
The
town
began
as
a
railroad
station
for
the
Santa
Fe
railroad
,
and
was
named
Alfred
,
for
the
son
of
an
attorney
.

The
town
is
named
after
Zach
Mulhall
,
father
of
Lucille
Mulhall
who
was
the
first
official
'
cowgirl
'
to
actually
compete
against
men
in
rodeo
events
and
win
.

The
town
name
was
changed
from
Alfred
to
Mulhall
due
to
a
petition
made
by
Zach
to
the
railroad
shortly
after
the
land
run
of
0000
because
there
were
two
towns
named
'
Alfred
'
at
that
time
.

Zach
Mulhall
hosted
his
own
show
for
many
years
across
the
country
with
Lucille
starring
in
those
shows
along
with
her
siblings
.

Zach
and
the
Mulhall
family
were
also
friends
with
the
Miller
Brothers
of
000
Ranch
Fame
in
nearby
Ponca
City
and
often
performed
with
them
and
shared
talent
for
their
shows
when
needed
.

Will
Rogers
and
Tom
Mix
were
also
integral
parts
of
the
early
years
of
the
shows
and
Will
(
then
performing
under
the
stage
name
,
"
The
Cherokee
Kid
}
"
)
is
credited
with
teaching
Lucille
how
to
twirl-another
talent
for
which
she
was
known
.

Carrie
Nation
visited
Mulhall
in
0000
to
tell
the
town
saloons
about
the
evils
of
liquor
and
warning
that
she
would
return
.

The
town
immediately
ordered
the
saloon
out
of
business
.

In
0000
,
Leslie
's
Weekly
carried
a
picture
of
Lucille
,
calling
her
the
world
's
champion
lariat
thrower
,
a
title
she
won
in
San
Antonio
.

It
also
states
that
she
entertained
President
Theodore
Roosevelt
.

About
00
percent
of
the
town
was
destroyed
on
May
0
,
0000
,
000
years
after
the
town
's
founding
,
by
a
violent
high-end
F0
tornado
(
possibly
F0
before
hitting
the
town
)
which
was
recorded
to
be
well
over
one
mile
wide
at
times
.

The
town
's
water
tower
collapsed
due
to
the
violent
winds
.

Lucille
's
Restaurant
,
located
in
the
old
Bank
Building
,
was
one
of
the
few
original
structures
to
survive
the
tornado
.

The
restaurant
boasted
eclectic
photographs
of
Lucille
and
her
family
during
the
heyday
of
their
lives
and
performances
in
Wild
West
Shows
featured
in
the
decor
.

On
September
0
,

the
restaurant
was
extensively
damaged
by
fire
.

It
was
rebuilt
and
is
still
open
today

catering

a
variety
of

History
Thackerville
was
founded
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

The
community
is
named
after
Zacariah
Thacker
,
a
pioneer
from
Arkansas
.

It
is
believed
that
he
was
headed
for
the
Amarillo
,
Texas
area
,
but
he
camped
one
night
at
Wolf
Hollow
Creek
in
Indian
Territory
and
remained
there
until
his
death
a
few
years
later
.

Thacker
befriended
some
of
the
local
Indians
and
together
they
farmed
a
very
productive
corn
crop
.

Before
long
,
many
people
began
settling
in
the
area
.

After
Thacker
's
death
in
0000
,
the
community
relocated
from
its
original
site
near
Addington
Bend
,
to
its
present
location
.

The
main
reason
behind
the
move
was
to
be
closer
to
the
Atchison
,
Topeka
,
and
Santa
Fe
Railway
.

A
depot
was
constructed
and
the
first
grocery
store
,
built
by
Oce
McCage
,
opened
across
from
it
.

Soon
after
,
a
school
,
churches
,
and

post
office
were
constructed
.

walks
that
connected
store
porches
.

to
incorporate
Thackerville
under

00
,
0000
.

At

time
,
approximately

people
lived

community
.

On
July
0
,
0000
,
Thackerville
was
officially
incorporated
into
Indian
Territory
by
Judge
Hosea
Townsend
.

U.S.
Highway
00
was
established
from
the
Red
River
through
Thackerville
in

.

At
that
time
,
the
town
moved
to
each
side
of
the
highway
,
which
became
the
new
"
main
"
street
in
the
community
.

station
and
ordered
him
to
"
flag
down
"
the
train
.

As

train
pulled
to
a
stand-still
two
members
of
the
gang
boarded
the
engine
while
the
others
covered
the
conductor
and
train

.

The
station
operator
was
taken
to

,
were
he
ordered
the
messenger
inside
to
open

When
the
messenger
refused
,
the
train
's
fireman
was
ordered
to
break
open
the
door
with
his
pick
.

Once
inside
the
bandits
were
quick
in
rifling
the
safe

J.
H.
LaFlore

the
Cherokee
Indian
police

was
happening
the
guards
unloaded
from
the
train
on
the
east
side
of
the
train
-
the
opposite
side
of
the
depot
.

Several
of
the
bandits
had
been
positioned
on
that
side
and
a
brief
gun
battle
took
place
.

With
their
work
in
the
train
finished
and
the
gun
battle
insignia
,
the
bandits
proceeded
to
make
their
get-away
.

With
bullets
whistling
about
,
the
bandits
made
their

and
capturing
another
000
while
sustaining
only
minimal

a
loss
of
morale
and
desertions
among
the
Cherokee
Confederate
supporters
.

,
the

project
five

to
return
.

chamber
of
commerce
formed
,

farming
and
cattle
ranching
.

Pryor
Creek
,
usually
known
as
simply
Pryor
,
is
a
city
in
Mayes
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
,
compared
to
0,000
in
the
0000
census
.

Originally
named
Coo-Y-Yah
,
Cherokee
for
Huckleberry
,
it
was
renamed
Pryor
Creek
,
the
name
of
the
local
railroad
station
(
named
for
the
creek
)
.

Due
to
confusion
in
distinguishing
handwritten
mailing
addresses
to
Pryor
Creek
and
Pond
Creek
,
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
name
for
the
city
was
shortened
to
Pryor
,
though
the
official
name
of
the
city
remains
Pryor
Creek
.

History
The
history
of
Pryor
Creek
,
Oklahoma
has
roots
that
go
back
over
000
years
.

The
Union
Mission
was
established
in
0000
,
southeast
of
what
is
the
Chouteau-Mazie
area
.

Here
was
where
the
first
school
and
printing
press
were
established
in
what
is
now
the
State
Of
Oklahoma
.

Just
prior
to
the
establishment
of
Union
Mission
,
Captain
Nathaniel
Pryor
settled
near
here
and
established
a
trading
post
on
Grand
River
.

Captain
Pryor
was
a
member
of
the
Lewis
and
Clark
Expedition
,
a
veteran
of
the
War
of
0000
,
and
agent
to
the
Osage
Indians
.

Over
a
period
of
years
,
pioneers
and
explorers
carved
a
trail
through
this
section
of
the
country
that
became
known
as
the
Texas
or
Old
Military
Road
.

It
passed
north
and
south
near
what
is
now
known
as
U.S.
Highway
00
.

In
0000
,
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
started
construction
in
the
Cherokee
Nation
along
the
Kansas
border
,
laying
tracks
to
Texas
.

By
June
0000
,
the
railroad
reached
the
point
where
the
present
town
now
lies
.

Now
known
as
the
Union
Pacific
,
the
railroad
continues
to
be
a
valuable
asset
to
the
commerce
of
the
community
and
county
.

A
post
office
was
eventually
established
naming
the
town
Coo-y-yah
,
Indian
Territory
.

Coo-y-yah
is
the
Cherokee
name
for
"
huckleberry
"
.

On
April
00
,
0000
,
Coo-y-yah
was
changed
to
Pryor
Creek
,
but
the
"
Creek
"
was
dropped
by
the
post
office
on
January
00
,
0000
.

The
official
name
of
the
city
government
is
still
Pryor
Creek
despite
a
proposition
put
before
voters
in
0000
to
change
the
name
.

The
first
mayor
,
James
Lee
Mills
,
a
Cherokee
,
served
from
0000-0000
.

Mayor
Mills
was
a
businessman
,
newspaper
publisher
,
and
lawman
.

In
0000
,
voters
approved
the
present
City
Charter
of
a
Mayor-Council
form
of
government
.

In
this
form
of
government
,
voters
elect
a
Mayor
,
Clerk
,
Treasurer
,
Police
Chief
and
eight
Council
Members
.

The
charter
also
established
a
Cemetery
,
Park
,
and
Library
Board
as
well
as
a
Municipal
Utility
Board
(
MUB
)
,
which
oversees
operations
of
the
city-owned
gas
,
water
,
electric
and
sewer
systems
.

The
Whitaker
Orphan
's
Home
was
established
in
0000
by
W.T.
and
Stacy
Whitaker
to
provide
for
the
orphan
white
children
of
the
Indian
Territory
.

In
0000
,
the
home
became
a
state
institution
for
orphans
and
other
children
in
need
.

In
0000
the
state
closed
down
the
home
and
turned
the
facility
over
to
the
Oklahoma
Military
Department
.

Under

Tornado
On
April
00
,
0000
,
a
tornado
swept
along
Pryor
Creek
's
main
street
from
the
western
edge
of
the
business
district
to
the
eastern
edge
of
the
city
,
destroying
nearly
every
building
and
causing
extensive
damage
to
the
residential
section
.

The
twister
was
described
by
a
witness
as
the
"
most
awful
looking
thing
anyone
could
imagine
"
.

The
storm
killed
00
people
,
according
to
the
U.S.
Weather
Bureau
,
but
The
Associated
Press
set
the
total
at
00
two
days
after
the
storm
.

More
than
000
were
injured
in
the
storm
that
caused
damage
estimated
at
US$
0
million
.

The
F0
tornado
struck
about
0
pm
(
00:00
)
local
time
,
an
hour
and
a
half
after
one
hit
near
Talala
,
and
mowed
a
path
about
long
,
killing
three
and
injuring
00
.

Talala
,
which
was
not
hit
,
is
about
northwest
of
Pryor
Creek
.

Both
of
Pryor
Creek
's
hospitals
were
wrecked
by
the
storm
,
the
city
's
water
supply
was
disrupted
,
and
there
was
no
electrical
or
telephone
service
.

Residential
areas
also
suffered
extensive
damage
.

Gov.
Leon
C.
Phillips
put
the
area
under
martial
law
,
but
because
the
Oklahoma
National
Guard
had
been
activated
for
service
during
World
War
II
,
he
sent
state
troopers
to
rescue
victims
,
maintain
order
and
prevent
looting
.

The
troopers
were
assisted
by
soldiers
stationed
at
the
Oklahoma
Ordnance
Works
south
of
the
city
and
by
employees
of
duPont
Co.
that
was
to
operate
the
gunpowder
plant
at
the
OOW
.

Ambulances
were
on
the
scene
from
Tulsa
,
Muskogee
,
Vinita
,
Claremore
,
Wagoner
,
and
Siloam
Springs
,
Arkansas
.

Water
was
trucked
in
from
Vinita
and
from
the
Oklahoma
Ordnance
Works
.

Tulsa
doctors
interrupted
their
weekly
meeting
,
and
a
team
of
00
went
to
Pryor
to
care
for
victims
.

Others
went
to
the
Tulsa
hospitals
to
treat
any
victims
sent
there
.

A
shuttle
train
that
usually
transported
workers
between
Muskogee
and
the
Ordnance
Works
site
was
pressed
into
service
to
transport
injured
victims
to
Vinita
for
treatment
.

The
Pryor
tornado
ranks
as
the
fifth
deadliest
in
Oklahoma
history
behind
tornadoes
at
Woodward
in
0000
,
Snyder
in
0000
,
Peggs
in
0000
,
and
Antlers
in
0000
.

The
May
0
,
0000
,
tornado
at
Midwest
City
caused
more
damage
but
fewer
deaths
.

Talala
residents
said
they
did
not
see
the
typical
funnel
of
a
tornado
in
the
storm
.

They
described
what
looked
like
a
series
of
streaks
reaching
from
the
clouds
to
the
ground
which
leveled
everything
in
their
paths
.

At
Pryor
Creek
,
however
,
the
tornado
had
a
definite
funnel
.

History
For
thousands
of
years
indigenous
peoples
had
lived
along
the
rivers
in
this
area
,
with
varying
cultures
.

By
the
time
of
European
encounter
,
the
Osage
was
a
major
tribe
in
the
area
.

Their
territory
started
at
the
Missouri
River
and
extended
west
,
including
to
parts
of
present-day
Arkansas
.

In
0000
the
Spanish
explorer
Hernando
de
Soto
and
expedition
passed
through
the
area
,
as
did
the
0000
expedition
of
Bernard
de
la
Harpe
.

They
gave
Spanish
names
to
many
of
the
local
streams
,
which
the
Osage
had
already
named
.

In
0000
Jean
Pierre
Chouteau
,
a
French
trader
from
St.
Louis
,
established
the
first
trading
post
in
0000
at
the
junction
of
the
Grand
/
Neosho
River
and
Saline
Creek
for
business
with
the
Osage
.

Remembered
today
as
one
of
the
first
permanent
"
white
"
(
European-American
)
settlements
in
present-day
Oklahoma
,
at
that
time
the
area
was
part
of
the
Province
of
Louisiana
.

The
United
States
took
possession
of
the
land
that
included
Salina
with
the
Louisiana
Purchase
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
keelboats
were
landing
goods
at
Salina
from
Ft.
Smith
,
Arkansas
,
and
the
area
was
considered
part
of
what
was
known
as
"
Indian
Territory
"
of
the
United
States
.

That
year
,
Chouteau
's
son
Auguste
Pierre
and
his
partner
Joseph
Revoir
received
an
exclusive
license
from
Spanish
authorities
to
trade
with
the
Osage
.

In
0000
,
the
Spanish
government
of
the
time
took
the
monopoly
away
.

Chouteau
convinced
the
Osage
tribe
,
under
the
leadership
of
Cashesgra
(
"
Big
Trek
"
)
,
to
migrate
into
Indian
Territory
near
the
trading
post
,
and
ensured
the
survival
of
the
business
.

In
0000
,
the
United
States
Department
of
War
authorized
Epaphras
Chapman
to
establish
the
Union
Mission
near
the
mouth
of
Chouteau
Creek
to
educate
and
convert
the
Osage
.

The
mission
had
the
first
printing
press
in
present-day
Oklahoma
.

Under
its
policy
of
Indian
Removal
,
the
US
government
began
to
remove
Native
American
tribes
from
the
Southeast
,
giving
them
land
in
the
Territory
in
exchange
.

The
Indians
boiled
salt
from
the
water
rising
from
limestone
rock
about
a
mile
south
of
the
trading
post
.

Springs
included
one
hot
water
geyser
that
shot
boiling
water
0
to
into
the
air
.

Chouteau
obtained
the
springs
in
a
treaty
in
0000
and
sold
them
to
Sam
Houston
in
0000
.

A
Cherokee
,
Captain
John
Rogers
,
began
making
salt
from
the
springs
and
named
them
Grand
Saline
.

He
built
his
home
nearby
.

Washington
Irving
visited
on
October
0
,
0000
,
accompanied
by
Sam
Houston
.

In
0000
the
government
began
moving
Cherokee
to
the
area
in
implementation
of
the
Indian
Removal
Act
.

By
0000
,
Rogers
was
operating
000
salt
kettles
.

He
lost
the
salt
works
in
0000
to
the
Cherokee
Nation
under
a
new
law
defining
their
territory
.

The
Cherokee
leased
the
works
to
Lewis
Ross
(
brother
of
Chief
John
Ross
)
.

Ross
built
a
house
there
and
operated
the
salt
business
using
African
American
slave
labor
.

Drilling
for
salt
water
,
in
0000
Ross
accidentally
hit
the
first
vein
of
oil
in
Indian
Territory
(
Oklahoma
)
.

It
flowed
at
the
rate
of
00
barrels
a
day
for
a
year
.

He
operated
two
stores
in
Salina
.

In
0000
during
the
American
Civil
War
,
Union
soldiers
came
down
unopposed
on
the
Grand
River
to
Salina
and
set
all
slaves
free
.

The
soldiers
ransacked
the
Ross
home
,
had
the
slaves
load
everything
on
wagons
,
and
hauled
the
goods
across
the
border
to
the
free
state
of
Kansas
.

In
0000
the
Cherokee
Nation
purchased
the
Ross
home
for
$
00,000
and
used
it
for
years
as
the
Cherokee
Orphan
Asylum
.

It
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
0000
.

Reconstructed
,
the
structure
is
now
used
as
a
gym
.

The
Cherokee
chief
Samuel
Houston
Mayes
established
a
ferry
and
mercantile
business
on
the
Grand
River
in
0000
.

During
his
term
as
Chief
,
the
Dawes
Commission
of
0000/0000
divided
the
Cherokee
lands
into
allotments
of
approximately
000
acres
per
household
,
breaking
up
the
communal
lands
.

They
allotted
00
acres
per
household
for
Cherokee
Freedmen
,
not
having
determined
if
they
had
Cherokee
ancestry
or
identified
as
Cherokee
,
but
classifying
all
persons
of
identifiably
African
descent
as
"
Freedmen
"
on
the
Dawes
Rolls
.

Some
had
sufficient
Cherokee
ancestry
to
be
classified
as
Cherokee
;
this
has
been
one
of
the
issues
since
the
late
twentieth
century
and
the
membership
controversy
of
Cherokee
Freedmen
.

The
establishment
of
the
Old
Chouteau
Trading
Post
at
Salina
was
commemorated
on

.

The
Ozark
Trail
bridge
over
the
South
Canadian
River
between
Newcastle
and
Oklahoma
City
was
the
first
federal
funded
highway
project
built
in
Oklahoma
,
in
0000
.

It
was
a
steel
thru-truss
bridge
with
timber
flooring
and
carried
traffic
on
the
Ozark
Trail
,
which
was
later
designated
as
US
00
.

Until
the
mid-twenties
,
there
was
a
major
river
ford
at
May
Avenue
that
was
used
whenever
the
water
was
n't
too
deep
.

Farmers
from
Newcastle
forged
the
river
with
their
horses
and
wagons
and
traveled
up
May
Avenue
on
their
way
to
the
Oklahoma
City
Farmer
's
Market
by
Western
and
Reno
.

Today
,
the

bridge

few
square
miles
until
around
0000
,
when

City
began
annexing
huge
chunks
of
land
across
the
river
.

Newcastle
expanded
,
as
did
Tuttle
and
Blanchard
,
to
prevent
the
city
from
trying
to
move
across
the
river
.

The
population
grew
very
little
until
the
mid-0000s
,
when
Oklahoma
City
began
expanding
past
SW
00th
Street
,
populating
near
the
I-00
corridor
.

In
the
0000s
,
most
of
the
city
's
territory
near
Norman
(
north
of
state
HW
0
)
was
annexed
.

The
0000
Oklahoma
tornado
outbreak
struck
parts
of
Newcastle
,
resulting
in
the
destruction
of
several
homes
in
the
city
limits
,
however
much
greater
destruction
occurred
in
Bridge
Creek
,
Oklahoma
and
Moore
,
Oklahoma
.

In
0000
,
a
Wal-Mart
Super
Center
opened
,
which
resulted
in
significant
development
at
Tri-City
shopping
district
.

In
0000
,
Newcastle
was
listed
in
the
Top

fastest
growing
communities
in
Oklahoma
with
a

increase
of

There
were
an

Notable
people
Popular
Media
In
"
Broken
Bow
"
,
the
0000
pilot
episode
of
the
television
series
Star
Trek
:
Enterprise
,
Broken
Bow
was
the
site
of
Human
-
Klingon
first
contact
in
0000
.

A
messenger
named
Klaang
was
shot
down
by
the
Suliban
over
a
corn
field
.

Shortly
after
dispatching
his
enemies
,
Klaang
was
shot
by
a
farmer
named
Moore
.

Although
severely
injured
,
Klaang
survived
.

It
is
worth
noting
that
the
area
depicted
in
this
episode
is
flat
farmland
,
whereas
the
area
around
Broken
Bow
in
the
present
day
is
hilly
and
forested
.

Because
of
this
anomalous
depiction
,
it
was
speculated
that
the
locale
in
the
Star
Trek
episode
may
have
referred
to
Broken
Bow
,
Oklahoma
's
namesake
Broken
Bow
,
Nebraska
.

However
,
dialog
in
the
Enterprise
episode
"
Detained
"
,
Captain
Archer
is
asked
what
he
might
know
about
a
place
called
Broken
Bow
in
Oklahoma
-
seeming
to
settle
which
Broken
Bow
was
referred
to
in
the
pilot
episode
.

Broken
Bow
and
the
surrounding
area
also
served
as
the
location
for
the
episode
"
00:00
"
of
the
television
series
Millennium
,
in
which
Frank
Black
led
a
search
for
a
group
of
children
who
had
been
abducted
on
their
way
to
school
.

The
abductor
,
a
crazed
visionary
who
believed
he
was
the
one
destined
to
carry
out
the
Book
of
Revelation
's
instructions
,
entombed
the
children
in
an
abandoned
quarry
.

This
ultimately
saved
them
from
a
deadly
tornado
that
destroyed
the
schoolhouse
where
they
otherwise
would
have
been
.

Idabel
is
a
city
in
McCurtain
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
McCurtain
County
.

The
town
is
located
in
the
tourist
area
Kiamichi
Country
.

History
Idabel
was
established
in
0000
by
the
Arkansas
and
Choctaw
Railway
(
later
part
of
the
St.
Louis
and
San
Francisco
Railway
(
Frisco
)
.

The
city
was
first
named
Purnell
,
after
Isaac
Purnell
,
a
railroad
official
.

When
postal
officials
rejected
that
designation
,
the
name
was
changed
to
Mitchell
,
honoring
another
railroad
company
officer
.

Postal
officials
also
rejected
because
another
post
office
of
that
name
existed
elsewhere
in
the
territory
.

They
named
the
post
office
Bokhoma
(
a
Choctaw
word
meaning
Red
River
)
,
which
opened
December
00
,
0000
.

Railroad
officials
then
chose
the
name
Idabel
,
a
compound
of
the
names
of
Isaac
Purnell
's
two
daughters
,
Ida
and
Bell
.

The
post
office
was
then
renamed
Idabel
.

Idabel
had
no
local
government
for
its
first
four
years
,
since
that
was
the
responsibility
of
the
Choctaw
tribal
government
for
members
of
the
tribe
.

The
federal
government
was
responsible
for
enforcing
the
law
among
non-members
.

In
0000
,
the
citizens
elected
thei
first
mayor
and
established
a
mayor-council
form
of
government
.

At
the
time
of
statehood
,
November
00
,
0000
,
the
town
was
designated
as
the
county
seat
of
McCurtain
County
.

A
census
in
that
year
reported
000
residents
.

By
0000
,
the
population
had
grown
to
0,000
.

In
0000
,
there
were
0,000
residents
,
but
the
number
fell
to
0,000
in
0000
.

Growth
resumed
by
the
end
of
the
0000s
.

Initially
,
timber
was
the
basis
for
the
local
economy
,
but
this
was
supplanted
by
cotton
production
after
the
nearby
forests
were
cleared
.

One
cotton
gin
operated
in
Idabel
in
0000
,
but
six
were
in
business
in
0000
.

However
,
the
Great
Depression
,
depleted
soil
and
destructive
pests
essentially
wiped
out
this
industry
around
Idabel
.

Landowners
converted
their
properties
to
pastures
and
expanded
beef
production
.

Chicken
farms
were
also
established
in
the
area
and
marginal
agricultural
land
was
turned
into
pine
plantations
.

for
a
major
processing
plant
that
utilized
abundant
timber
harvested
from
the
region
's
virgin
forests
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
a
post
office
charter
was
issued
for
Bismark
,
a
name
chosen
by
the
Dierks
brothers
,
the
company
founders
,
for
a
Nebraska
town
where
they
formerly
operated
a
lumber
outlet
.

The
name
of
the
town
and
post
office
changed
to
Wright
during
World
War
I
because
of
public
association
of
the
Bismark
name
with
that
of
the
former
German
chancellor
,
Otto
von
Bismarck
.

The
new
name
was
chosen
to
honor
William
Wiley
Wright
,
the
county
's
first
war
casualty
.

On
May
00
,
0000
,
the
name
was
altered
to
Wright
City
.

The
"
company
town
"
included
a
sawmill
,
planer
,
railroad
maintenance
shops
,
housing
,
and
stores
,
a
bank
,
hotel
,
and
ice
factory
,
and
provision
for
fire
and
police
protection
.

The
lumber
conglomerate
also
provided
land
for
construction
of
a
school
and
churches
.

The
company
,
then
known
as
Dierks
Forests
,
Inc.
,
divested
itself
of
residential
and
other
properties
unrelated
to
the
primary
mission
on
August
00
,
0000
.

In
0000
the
town
achieved
incorporation
and
elected
its
first
officials
.

As
Wright
City
was
no
longer
just
a
"
mill
town
,
"
citizens
took
the
initiative
to
create
an
independent
,
distinctive
municipality
.

A
business
district
was
developed
,
utilities
were
upgraded
and
expanded
,
and
new
schools
,
a
community
building
,
and
a
medical
center
were
built
.

In
0000
,
the
Weyerhaeuser
Company
of
Tacoma
,
Washington
,
purchased
the
Dierks
's
holdings
,
including
the
Wright
City
production
complex
and
continued
the
operations
,
which
remained
the
primary
economic
base
of
the
community
until
March
0000
when
all
operations
of
the
mill
ceased
due
to
low
demand
for
lumber
and
the
worsening
economy
.

The
town
population
initially
was
included
in
a
large
census
tract
and
not
counted
separately
until
0000
when
the
residents
numbered
0,000
.

In
the
0000s
the
population
was
estimated
to
be
less
than
five
hundred
.

In
0000
the
count
stood
at
0,000
but
by
0000
had
decreased
to
000
.

At
the
turn
of
the
twenty-first
century
the
town
had
000
residents
.

Wright
City
hosts
one
of
the
oldest
continuous
rodeos
in
Oklahoma
,
known
as
Little
Cheyenne
,
held
each
July
0
through
0
.

In
0000
a
few
local
cowboys
started
it
as
a
rodeo
,
barbecue
,
and
dance
.

Since
0000
,
the
American
Legion
,
William
Wright
Post
Number

,
has
sponsored
the
event
.

southern
part
of
the
county
,
on
the
Missouri
,
Kansas
&
Texas
Railway
,
not
far
from
the
Canadian
River
.

The
name
"
Eufaula
"
comes
from
the
Eufaula
tribe
,
part
of
the
Muscogee
Creek
Confederacy
,
whose
tribal
jurisdictional
area
the
town
falls
under
today
.

As
early
as
the
year
0000
,
the
Muscogee
Creeks
had
a
town
of
that
name
,
on
Eufaula
Creek
,
near
the
present
site
of
Talladega
,
Alabama
.

It
was
one
of
their
early
Upper
Creek
towns
.

Pickett
's
History
of
Alabama
mentions
an
Indian
town
,
belonging
to
the
Creeks
,
which
he
calls
Eufaulahatche
.

Little
Eufauly
is
mentioned
by
one
of
the
historians
as
early
as
0000
.

Another
upper
creek
town
called
Eufaula
,
was
located
on
the
Tallapoosa
River
,
near
the
present
town
of
Dadeville
,
Alabama
.

Another
Eufaula
,
known
as
a
lower
creek
town
,
was
located
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Chattahoochee
River
,
within
the
limits
of
the
present
County
of
Quitman
in
the
State
of
Georgia
.

In
0000
some
of
the
Indians
of
this
settlement
went
down
to
the
mouth
of
Flint
River
and
established
another
town
of
the
same
name
.

And
still
another
lower
creek
town
,
called
Eufaula
,
was
located
on
the
Chattahoochee
River
,
in
Henry
County
,
Alabama
.

Eufaula
began
to
develop
into
a
town
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
railroad
in
0000
,
although
for
forty
years
before
that
time
it
was
a
well-known
Indian
center
,
a
favorite
meeting
place
for
the
Creeks
.

Many
of
the
pow-wow
s
or
Indian
conferences
were
held
in
that
vicinity
during
the
early
days
.

The
old
Indian
settlement
of
that
name
was
,
however
,
several
miles
from
the
present
site
of
the
town
,
but
through
the
influence
of
G.
W.
Grayson
,
the
present
Chief
of
the
Creeks
,
his
brother
Samuel
,
George
Stidham
and
others
,
the
Railroad
Company
was
induced
to
locate
one
of
its
stations
at
the
present
site
of
the
town
and
the
old
Indian
village
was
moved
to
the
station
.

D.
B.
Whitlow
and
Joseph
Coody
established
the
first
store
on
the
west
side
of
the
railroad
and
the
Graysons
and
G.
E.
Seales
started
a
store
on
the
east
side
about
the
same
time
.

Dr.
W.
H.
Bailey
was
the
first
physician
and
druggist
to
locate
in
the
new
town
.

Rev.
R.
C.
McGee
,
a
Presbyterian
missionary
,
established
one
of
the
first
churches
in
Eufaula
and
remained
in
charge
of
it
for
many
years
.

The
old
Asbury
Mission
School
,
located
two
miles
northeast
of
Eufaula
was
,
for
many
years
previous
to
the
Civil
war
,
the
leading
educational
institution
of
that
vicinity
.

It
served
the
Creek
people
faithfully
,
but
was
finally
destroyed
by
fire
.

Some
of
the
most
prominent
citizens
of
the
Creek
Nation
have
resided
in
or
near
Eufaula
,
among
whom
were
the
two
Graysons
,
George
W.
and
his
brother
,
Samuel
.

Samuel
was
an
intelligent
Indian
,
deeply
interested
in
the
educational
welfare
of
his
people
.

He
resided
in
that
vicinity
for
many
years
,
and
was
extensively
engaged
in
cattle
raising
and
merchandising
.

His
death
occurred
in
Eufaula
in
the
early
0000s
.

Grayson
,
the
late
Chief
of
the
Creek
Nation
who
died
recently
at
about
seventy-eight
years
of
age
,
was
over
six
feet
in
height
,
and
notwithstanding
his
advanced
age
,
was
as
straight
as
an
arrow
.

He
was
born
near
Eufaula
and
had
resided
in
the
Creek
Nation
from
his
birth
.

He
attended
school
at
the
old
Asbury
Mission
in
his
youth
and
later
attended
the
University
of
Arkansas
.

He
acquired
a
good
English
education
and
so
thoroughly
learned
the
Creek
language
,
that
his
services
as
an
interpreter
have
been
in
frequent
demand
.

He
had
given
much
of
his
time
to
his
people
having
served
for
several
terms
in
the
Creek
Council
,
and
having
made
frequent
trips
to
Washington
as
the
Creek
delegate
.

Charles
Gibson
Charley
Gibson
was
a
well-known
Creek
citizen
who
spent
his
whole
life
in
the
vicinity
of
Eufaula
.

He
was
born
in
0000
,
on
a
farm
near
Eufaula
,
and
although
his
opportunities
for
securing
an
education
were
very
limited
,
he
acquired
a
good
practical
education
.

Upon
reaching
manhood
he
engaged
in
the
mercantile
business
,
first
as
a
clerk
in
Grayson
's
store
,
then
as
the
proprietor
of
a
grocery
.

During
the
latter
part
of
his
life
he
acquired
quite
a
reputation
as
a
local
news
correspondent
and
his
inimitable
style
of
composition
made
him
popular
with
the
newspaper
fraternity
.

He
was
a
generous-hearted
man
and
interested
in
the
welfare
of
his
people
,
as
was
proven
by
the
fact
that
he
reared
and
educated
several
Creek
orphans
.

E.
Foley
Among
the
early
white
settlers
,
no
one
has
stood
higher
in
the
estimation
of
the
citizens
of
Eufaula
,
than
Mr.
C.
E.
Foley
.

He
showed
his
faith
in
the
future
of
the
town
by
organizing
a
bank
,
building
a
hotel
,
and
in
promoting
various
other
enterprises
.

His
kindheartedness
and
his
public
spiritedness
have
caused
him
to
be
regarded
as
everybody
's
friend
.

Alexander

'

His
long
,
black
hair
,
his
characteristic
Indian
complexion
,
his
straight
manly
bearing
and
genteel
manners
,
gave
him
a
close
resemblance
of
the
ideal

.

He
was
a
persistent
reader
and
student
,
well
informed
in

an
American
politician
from

for

and
professionally

Schools
The
settlers
of
Eufaula
demonstrated
their
interest
in
education
by
erecting
a
school
on
the
east
side
of
the
railroad
,
and
establishing
a
free
school
by
voluntary
taxation
,
before
there
was
any
law
authorizing
the
levy
of
taxes
for
school
purposes
.

As
soon
as
the
Curtis
Act
was
passed
by
Congress
,
Eufaula
took
advantage
of
it
by
levying
taxes
and
starting
to
build
up
a
first
class
public
school
system
,
and
to
make
other
needed
public
improvements
.

The
city
now
has
paved
streets
,
a
splendid
"
White
Way
,
"
five
brick
and
stone
schoolhouses
,
seven
churches
,
a

,
four

,
the

brick
boarding
school
for
Creek
girls
and
an
abundance
of
natural
gas
for
domestic
and
commercial
purposes
.

There
is
also
a
very
active
civic
club
whose
purpose
is
to
make
the
town
a
better
place
to
live
in
,
rather
than
to
increase
its
numbers
,
an
ambition
which
is
concurred
in
generally
by
the
0,000
prosperous
and
contented
people
who
live
here

When
the
Jefferson
Highway
was
first
located
through
Eufaula
the
only
way
of
crossing
the
South
Canadian
River
,
about
four
miles
below
the
town
,
was
by
means
of
a
rather
uncertain
ferry
,
and
the
citizens
of
Eufaula
,
feeling
the
great
need
of
a
good
bridge
across
the
river
,
incorporated
-
The
Jefferson
Highway
Bridge
Company
,
and
at
a
cost
of
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
,
built
the
present
splendid
structure
of
steel
and
concrete
,
forty
feet
above
low
water
;
affording
a

day
crossing
throughout

.

Already
the
traffic
over
this
bridge
,
which
was
opened
for
use
April

,

,
bids
fair
to
justify
the
large
expenditure
upon
it
and
it
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
the
notable

of

,
All
American
,
starring

Lancaster
,
was
filmed
on

campus
of

Indian
College
at

History
French
fur
traders
were
believed
to
have
established
a
temporary
village
near
Muskogee
in
0000
,
but
the
first
permanent
settlement
was
established
in
0000
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Verdigris
River
,
north
of
Muskogee
.

The
Creek
Indians
and
their
slaves
relocated
to
the
area
after
the
passage
of
the
Indian
Removal
Act
of
0000
under
President
Andrew
Jackson
.

Muskogee
became
the
site
of
the
Indian
Agency
,
a
two-story
stone
building
where
the
heads
of
the
Five
Civilized
Tribes
met
.

Today
it
serves
as
a
museum
at
the
top
of
Agency
Hill
,
in
Honor
Heights
Park
,
on
the
west
side
of
Muskogee
.

In
0000
,
the
Missouri
–
Kansas
–
Texas
Railroad
was
extended
to
the
area
.

A
federal
court
was
established
in
the
city
in
0000
around
the
same
time
that
Indian
Territory
was
opened
to
settlers
via
land
rush
es
.

The
city
was
incorporated
on
March
00
,
0000
.

Ohio
native
Charles
N.
Haskell
moved
to
the
city
in
March
0000
.

He
took
a
quiet
town
of
more
than
0,000
people
to
a
center
of
business
and
industry
with
a
population
of
more
than
00,000
inhabitants
.

Haskell
built
the
first
five-story
business
block
in
Oklahoma
Territory
;
he
organized
and
built
most
of
the
railroads
running
into
the
city
.

He
built
and
owned
fourteen
brick
buildings
in
the
city
.

As
Muskogee
’s
economic
and
business
importance
grew
,
so
did
its
political
power
.

When
the
Civilized
Tribes
met
together
to
propose
an
Indian
State
,
the
State
of
Sequoyah
,
they
met
on
August
00
,
0000
in
Muskogee
to
draft
its
constitution
.

They
planned
to
have
Muskogee
serve
as
the
State
's
capital
.

Vetoed
by
US
President
Theodore
Roosevelt
,
the
proposed
State
of
Sequoyah
did
not
receive
federal
recognition
.

The
US
admitted
the
State
of
Oklahoma
to
the
Union
on
November
00
,
0000
as
the
00th
State
.

Muskogee
received
national
and
international
attention
when
,
in
May
0000
,
voters
elected
John
Tyler
Hammons
as
mayor
.

Nineteen
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
election
,
Hammons
is
among
the
youngest
mayors
in

.

History
The
town
of
Wann
has
connections
to
both
Cherokee
and
Eastern
Delaware
origins
.

The

and
a
nearby
creek
were
originally
named
Coon
,
after
a
Delaware
family
,
when
the
first
post
office
opened
July
00
,
0000
.

The
town
was
renamed
Wann
on
October

,
0000
,
to
honor
a
local
Cherokee
,
Robert
F.
Wann
.

The
town
was
a
station
on
the
stage
route
between
Coffeyville
,
Kansas
and
Bartlesville
,
Indian
Territory
.

When
the
Katy
Railroad
built
its
track
northwest

townspeople
relocated
to
be
nearer
the
Wann
railroad
station

's
first

Oil
was
discovered

Oil
Pool

time
,
leading
the
population
to
grow
to
000
in
0000
and
000
in
0000
.

The
boom
collapsed
and
so
did
the
population
.

railroad
track
was
abandoned
in
the
0000s
,
following
the
demise
of
the

Railroad

's
economy
now
depends
on

History
This
area
was
settled
by
Creek
Freedmen
,
whose
ancestors
had
been
held
as
slaves
of
the
Creek
at
the
time
of
Indian
Removal
in
the
0000s
.

After
the
American
Civil
War
,
the
United
States
negotiated
new
treaties
with
tribes
that
allied
with
the
Confederacy
.

It
required
them
to
emancipate
their
slaves
and
give
them
membership
in
the
tribes
.

Those
formerly
slaves
were
called
the
Creek
Freedmen
.

At
the
time
of
allotments
to
individual
households
under
the
Dawes
Commission
,
Creek
Freedmen
were
registered
as
such
on
the
Dawes
Rolls
(
even
if
they
were
of
mixed-race
and
also
descended
directly
from
Creek
ancestors
.
)

Creek
Freedmen
set
up
independent
townships
,
of
which
Boley
was
one
.

The
coming
of
the
Fort
Smith
&
Western
Railroad
allowed
agricultural
land
to
be
more
profitably
used
as
a
townsite
.

other
Creek
Freedmen
,
was
midway
between
Paden
and
Castle
,
and
ideal
for
a
station
stop
.

With
the
approval
of
the
railroad
management
,
Boley
,
Creek
Nation
,
Indian
Territory
was
created
.

As
there
were
no
other
African-American
towns
nearby
,
it
became
a
center
of
regional
business
.

During
the
early
part
of
the
00th
century
,
Boley
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
Negro
towns
in
the
US
.

It
boasted
the
first
nationally
chartered
bank
owned
by
blacks
,
and
its
own
electric
company
.

Booker
T.
Washington
visited
Boley
in
0000
,
and
was
so
impressed
that
he
included
Boley
in
his
speeches
.

Boley
's
development
paralleled
that
of
the
railroad
.

After
World
War
I
,
a
fall
in
agricultural
prices
and
the
bankruptcy
of
the
railroad
caused
Boley
's
failure
.

It
went
bankrupt
in
0000
during
the
Great
Depression
.

With
the
Second
Great
Migration
underway
,
by
0000
most
of
the
population
had
left
for
other
urban
areas
.

So
far
the
New
Great
Migration
has
not
benefited
Boley
.

History
Historically
occupied
by
the
Osage
and
Quapaw
,
who
ceded
their
lands
to
the
United
States
by
0000
,
after
Indian
Removal
of
tribes
from
the
Southeast
United
States
in
the
0000s
,
this
area
was
assigned
to
the
Creek
Nation
and
specifically
,
the
Thlopthlocco
Tribal
Town
.

Okemah
was
named
after
a
Kickapoo
Indian
chief
named
Chief
Okemah
.

In
March
0000
,
Chief
Okemah
built
a
bark
house
in
his
tribe
's
traditional
fashion
.

He
had
come
to
await
the
opening
of
the
townsite
which
took
his
name
April
00
,
0000
.

In
the
Kickapoo
language
,
okemah
means
"
things
up
high
,
"
such
as
highly
placed
person
or
town
or
high
ground
.

Okemah
had
the
chief
's
name
to
live
up
to
in
leadership
.

In
preparation
for
Oklahoma
's
being
admitted
as
a
state
,
the
Dawes
Commission
was
authorized
in
0000
to
work
with
the
Five
Civilized
Tribes
to
enroll
their
members
for
allotments
of
tribal
land
to
individual
households
.

Registration
of
tribal
members
lasted
from
0000-0000
.

After
allotment
,
the
government
was
going
to
declare
as
"
surplus
"
the
remaining
tribal
lands
,
and
sell
them
to
European-American
settlers
.

Okemah
was
platted
by
a
group
of
Shawnee
residents
in
March
0000
on
land
belonging
to
Mahala
and
Nocus
Fixico
,
full-blood
Creek
.

The
Fixicos
had
no
legal
right
at
the
time
to
sell
their
holding
,
as
enrollment
of
tribal
members
on
the
Dawes
Roll
continued
until
0000
,
and
no
land
sales
were
to
take
place
by
Indians
until
it
was
completed
.

That
did
not
appear
to
affect
the
promoters
or
the
development
of
the
town
.

A
post
office
opened
in
Okemah
on
May
00
,
0000
.

On
April

.

In
the
spring
of

,
Commission
restrictions
on
the
sale
of
townsite
lots
were
removed
.

The
Department
of
Interior
trustees
of
land
held
by
American
Indians
paid
the
Fixicos
$
00
an
acre
for
their
land
,
and
gave
legal
deeds
to
the
purchasers
who
claimed
title
.

in

The

two
railroad
surveyors

Perry
Rodkey

H.R.
Dexter

Dexter
is
credited
with
choosing

never

History
Weleetka
was
once
a
major
railroad
town
,
serving
as
the
division
point
for
the
Fort
Smith
and
Western
Railway
.

All
train
crews
changed
out
in
Weleetka
,
the
town
also
housed
major
shops
and
repair
facilities
for
the
Steam
Locomotives
.

Headquartered
in
Fort
Smith
,
Arkansas
,
the
Fort
Smith
and
Western
was
a
railroad
that
operated
in
the
states
of
Arkansas
and
Oklahoma
.

The
railroad
's
main
line
extended
000
miles
,
from
Ft.
Smith
,
Arkansas
,
through
Weleetka
to
Guthrie
,
Oklahoma
.

The
Fort
Smith
and
Western
owned
a
subsidiary
,
St.
Louis
,
El
Reno
and
Western
which
began
operating
00
miles
between
Guthrie
and
El
Reno
,
Oklahoma
in
June
0000
.

The
railroad
also
acquired
00.0
miles
of
trackage
rights
over
the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
from
Fallis
,
Oklahoma
to
Oklahoma
City
.

The
railroad
supported
much
of
the
business
and
hotels
of
the
City
in
the
first
half
of
the
0000s
.

Trains
entering
town
from
the
East
were
switched
and
broken
down
in
Weleetka
,
and
dispatched
Northwest
for
either
Oklahoma
City
,
Guthrie
or
El
Reno
.

Thanks
to
the
railroad
yard
in
Weleetka
,
the
single
Westbound
train
could
thus
become
two
Westbound
trains
.

The
reverse
was
true
for
Eastbound
Trains
.

Weleetka
was
vital
to
the
life
of
the
railroad
.

The
railroad
provided
regular
passenger
service
and
at
one
time
boasted
through
Pullman
sleeping
cars
to
and
from
St.
Louis
and
Oklahoma
City
.

The
route
of
the
FS&W
served
no
major
population
centers
,
but
did
serve
major
coal
mining
operations
in
eastern
Oklahoma
at
Coal
Creek
,
Bokoshe
,
and
McCurtain
.

Other
towns
served
included
Crowder
,
Okemah
,
Boley
,
Prague
,
Vernon
,
Indianola
and
Meridian
.

A
major
portion
of
the
road
's
freight
traffic
was
metallurgical-grade
coal
from
San
Bois
Coal
Company
mines
near
McCurtain
.

As
coal
traffic
declined
,
an
oil
discovery
near
Okemah
brought
additional
traffic
,
which
postponed
the
abandonment
of
the
railroad
.

The
Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad
withdrew
trackage
rights
between
Fallis
and
Oklahoma
City
in
January
0000
after
FS&W
defaulted
on
rental
fees
,
and
when
the
Fort
Smith
and
Western
ceased
operations
on
February
0
,
0000
,
Weleetka
lost
its
major
employer
.

History
The
Santa
Fe
rail
line
in
Oklahoma
Territory
,
established
a
water
and
coaling
station
for
steam
engines
at
this
location
when
the
Santa
Fe
Railroad
built
into
Indian
Territory
in
0000
.

The
site
for
the
station
was
chosen
because
it
was
the
highest
point
on
the
line
in
Oklahoma
County
;
train
could
more
easily
accelerate
going
downhill
while
leaving
the
station
in
either
direction
.

The
railroad
then
named
the
station
for
Edmond
Burdick
,
the
Santa
Fe
’s
traveling
freight
agent
;
when

town
was
formed
after

Midwest
City
is
a
city
in
Oklahoma
County
,
Oklahoma
,
United
States
,
and
a
part
of
the
Oklahoma
City
metropolitan
area
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
population
was
00,000
,
making
it
the
eighth
largest
city
in
the
state
.

The
city
was
developed
in
response
to
talk
of
an
air
field
being
located
nearby
and
named
for
the
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
's
original
designation
as
the
Midwest
Air
Depot
.

The
city
suffered
damage
during
two
tornados
,
the
first
in
May
0000
and
the
second
on
May
0
,
0000
.

History
W.P.
"
Bill
"
Atkinson
bought
land
in
the
area
that
would
become
Midwest
City
after
hearing
speculation
that
an
air
field
was
going
to
be
built
nearby
.

The
city
,
which
was
incorporated
on
March
00
,
0000
,
was
named
for
the
air
field
's
original
designation
as
the
Midwest
Air
Depot
.

When
Major
General
Clarence
L.
Tinker
of
Pawhuska
,
Oklahoma
became
the
first
American
general
killed
in
World
War
II
(
June
0
,
0000
)
near
Wake
Island
,
the
airfield
was
renamed
in
his
honor
.

Seward
Mott
,
the
director
of
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
's
Land
Planning
Division
,
helped
design
the
city
,
gaining
national
print
and
broadcast
attention
,
and
it
became
a
model
for
postwar
community
development
.

The
city
incorporated
the
Mishak
community
of
Czech
and
German
immigrants
that
had
formed
in
what
now
is
the
southeast
part
of
the
city
.

In
0000
,
returning
veteran
Nicholas
Harroz
opened
Nick
's
Brett
Drive
Grocery
,
which
later
became
Crest
Discount
Foods
.

Soon
after
its
opening
,
Midwest
City
citizens
opted
for
a
charter-council-city
manager
form
of
government
to
better
manage
their
rapid
growth
.

Midwest
City
's
regional
hospital
was
dedicated
October
0
,
0000
,
built
with
the
use
of
bond
money
.

Voters
also
approved
the
creation
of
a
junior
college
district
in
0000
.

Oscar
Rose
Junior
College
opened
its
doors
to
students
in
0000
and
is
now
known
as
Rose
State
College
.

The
Heritage
Park
Mall
opened
in
0000
on
North
Air
Depot
and
was
a
prime
shopping
area
in
the
city
for
several
decades
.

The
first
Sam
's
Club
was
opened
in
Midwest
City
on
April
0
,
0000
.

In
many
ways
,
the
city
remains
relatively
unchanged
over
the
last
twenty
years
.

Air
Depot
Blvd
spanning
from
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
to
Heritage
Park
Mall
still
serves
as
the
major
commercial
district
of
the
city
.

Of
course
,
many
businesses
have
come
and
gone
,
but
there
are
a
few
that
have
stood
the
test
of
time
.

Andy
's
Akropolis
,
a
Greek
restaurant
started
by
Larry
Hicks
,
has
served
many
thousands
of
hungry
airmen
through
the
last
thirty
years
.

The
restaurant
,
like
its
city
,
remains
almost
the
same
as
it
was
when
it
first
opened
its
doors
in
the
0000s
.

Midwest
City
's
economic
base
is
heavily
dependent
upon
Federal
tax
dollars
via
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
.

TAFB
remains
the
region
's
largest
employer
.

The
General
Motors
Oklahoma
City
Assembly
plant
was
another
major
employer
from
its
opening
in
0000
until
its
closure
in
February
0000
.

GM
closed
the
plant
as
part
as
a
cost-savings
measure
.

The
property
was
later
acquired
by
Oklahoma
County
Council
and
leased
to
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
for
$
0/year
.

Tinker
renamed
the
facility
the
Tinker
Aerospace
Complex
.

Portions
of
Midwest
City
particularly
northwest
of
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
sustained
extreme
damage
from
a
violent
tornado
that
swept
through
the
southern
and
eastern
areas
of
the
Oklahoma
City
Metro
on
May
0
,
0000
.

While
it
produced
F0
damage
in
South
Oklahoma
City
,
damage
in
Midwest
City
was
rated
F0
with
numerous
destroyed
homes
and
three
fatalities
.

Another
strong
struck
almost
exactly
the
same
area
four
years
later
on
May
0
,
0000
.

City
officials
worked
to
revitalize
S.E.
00th
Street
in
the
early
00st
century
,
leading
to
the
development
of
a
new
Town
Center
Plaza
shopping
area
that
faces
Interstate
00
and
Tinker
Air
Force
Base
.

The
Town
Center
Plaza
development
replaced
an
aging
,
largely
deserted
Atkinson
Plaza
shopping
center
.

In
0000
,
the
Reed
Center
,
a
convention
center
,
was
built
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Heritage
Park
Mall
has
slowly
dwindled
,
becoming
an
issue
of
contention
in
the
0000
mayoral
race
.
