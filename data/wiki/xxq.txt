Lionel-Adolphe
Groulx
(
;
January
00
,
0000
–
May
00
,
0000
)
was
a
Canadian
Roman
Catholic
priest
,
historian
and
Quebec
nationalist
.

Biography
Early
life
and
ordination
Groulx
,
the
son
of
a
farmer
and
lumberjack
,
and
direct
descendent
of
New
France
pioneer
Jean
Grou
,
was
born
at
Chenaux
,
Quebec
,
Canada
,
and
died
in
Vaudreuil
,
Quebec
.

After
his
seminary
training
and
studies
in
Europe
,
he
taught
at
Valleyfield
College
in
Salaberry-de-Valleyfield
,
and
then
the
Université
de
Montréal
.

In
0000
he
co-founded
a
monthly
journal
called
Action
Française
,
becoming
its
editor
in
0000
.

Study
of
Confederation
Groulx
was
one
of
the
first
Quebec
historians
to
study
Confederation
:
he
insisted
on
its
recognition
of
Quebec
rights
and
minority
rights
,
although
he
believed
a
combination
of
corrupt
political
parties
and
French
Canadian
minority
status
in
the
Dominion
had
failed
to
deliver
on
those
promises
,
as
the
Manitoba
conflict
exposed
.

Groulx
believed
that
only
through
national
education
and
the
Quebec
government
could
the
economic
and
social
inferiority
of
French
Canadian
s
be
repaired
.

Groulx
was
quite
successful
promoting
his
brand
of
ultramontanism
.

His
main
focus
was
to
restore
Quebeckers
'
pride
in
their
identity
by
knowledge
of
history
,
both
the
heroic
acts
of
New
France
and
the
French
Canadian
and
self-government
rights
obtained
through
a
succession
of
important
political
victories
:
0000
,
the
Quebec
Act
recognized
the
rights
of
the
Quebec
province
and
its
people
with
respect
to
French
law
,
Catholic
religion
and
the
French
language
;
in
0000
,
responsible
government
was
finally
obtained
after
decades
of
struggle
,
along
with
the
rights
of
the
French
language
;
in
0000
,
the
autonomy
of
the
province
of
Quebec
was
restored
as
Lower
Canada
was
an
essential
partner
in
the
creation
of
a
new
Dominion
through
Confederation
[
La
Confederation
canadienne
,
Montreal
,
Quebec
00/00
,
0000
(
0000
)
]
.

Lionel
Groulx
called
the
Canadian
Confederation
of
0000
a
failure
and
espoused
the
theory
that
French
Canada
's
only
hope
for
survival
was
to
bolster
a
French
State
and
a
Roman
Catholic
Quebec
as
the
means
to
emancipate
the
nation
and
a
bulwark
against
English
power
.

He
believed
the
powers
of
the
provincial
government
of
Quebec
could
and
should
be
used
,
within
Confederation
,
to
better
the
lot
of
the
French
Canadian
nation
,
economically
,
socially
,
culturally
and
linguistically
.

His
curriculum
and
writings
de-emphasized
or
ignored
conflicts
between
the
clergy
and
those
who
were
struggling
for
democratic
rights
,
and
de-emphasized
any
conflicts
between
the
"
habitants
"
or
peasant
class
and
the
French-Canadian
elites
.

He
preferred
the
settled
habitants
to
the
more
adventurous
and
,
in
his
view
,
licentious
coureurs
de
bois
.

In
0000
,
the
Université
de
Montréal
insisted
that
Groulx
sign
a
paper
saying
that
he
would
respect
Confederation
and
English-Canadian
sensibilities
as
a
condition
of
receiving
a
respectable
salary
for
his
teaching
work
.

He
would
not
sign
,
but
finally
agreed
to
a
condition
that
he
would
limit
himself
to
historical
studies
;
he
resigned
from
the
editorship
of
L'action
canadienne-française
soon
after
,
and
the
magazine
ceased
publication
at
the
end
of
the
year
.

Lionel
Groulx
's
major
writings
include
L'Appel
de
la
race
(
0000
)
,
Histoire
de
la
Confédération
,
Notre
grande
aventure
,
Histoire
du
Canada
français
(
0000
)
,
and
Notre
maître
le
passé
.

Writings
on
New
France
In
order
to
inculcate
such
pride
in
a
nation
he
considered
degraded
by
Conquest
,
he
engaged
in
national
myth-making
,
celebrating
the
days
of
New
France
as
a
golden
age
and
elevating
Dollard
des
Ormeaux
into
a
legendary
hero
.

He
has
been
described
as
the
first
French
Canadian
historian
to
consider
the
period
of
the
French
regime
superior
to
that
of
the
English
rule
that
followed
it
,
evaluating
the
Conquest
as
a
disaster
rather
than
the
common
nineteenth
century
view
of
it
as
a
blessing
that
saved
Quebec
from
the
atheist
terror
of
the
French
Revolution
.

He
also
developed
a
Quebec
history
curriculum
that
emphasized
the
heroism
of
New
France
,
the
challenge
British
Conquest
posed
to
the
survival
of
the
"
Canadiens
"
,
and
how
this
challenge
was
met
by
lengthy
political
struggles
for
democratic
rights
.

He
particularly
insisted
,
as
had
many
before
him
,
on
the
Quebec
Act
of
0000
as
the
official
recognition
of
his
nation
's
rights
.

He
bore
particular
affection
for
the
undertaking
of
Robert
Baldwin
and
Louis-Hippolyte
Lafontaine
,
that
in
0000
successfully
restored
the
rights
of
the
French
language
along
with
the
obtention
of
responsible
government
,
thus
thwarting
the
assimilation
plans
of
Lord
Durham
's
policy
of
forced
Union
between
Upper
and
Lower
Canada
.

(
See
Lord
Elgin
)
Ligue
d'action
française
At
the
Ligue
d'Action
française
,
Groulx
and
his
colleagues
hoped
to
inspire
revival
of
the
French
language
and
French
Canadian
culture
,
but
also
to
create
a
think
tank
and
public
space
of
reflection
,
so
that
the
French
Canadian
nation
's
elites
would
find
ways
to
remedy
French
Canada
's
underdevelopment
and
exclusion
from
big
business
.

Some
collaborators
of
the
review
thus
actively
participated
in
the
development
of
the
HEC
business
school
.

Others
were
actively
involved
in
the
promotion
of
the
Church
's
Social
doctrine
,
an
official
Catholic
answer
to
socio-economic
distress
that
was
meant
to
prevent
the
appeal
of
socialism
and
improve
capitalism
.

Groulx
's
conservative
Catholicism
was
not
very
appreciative
of
other
religions
,
although
he
also
acknowledged
that
racism
was
not
Christian
,
and
he
maintained
that
Quebec
should
aspire
to
be
a
model
society
by
Christian
standards
,
including
intense
missionary
action
.

.

Catholic
social
teaching
This
Catholic
social
doctrine
later
became
part
of
the
0000s
Action
liberale
nationale
(
ALN
)
party
,
a
new
party
that
intellectuals
close
to
Groulx
and
the
defunct
Action
française
appreciated
.

When
Maurice
Duplessis
's
victory
became
apparent
,
some
instead
accepted
to
cooperate
with
his
government
and
its
reforms
.

But
Groulx
,
and
with
him
a
large
number
of
intellectuals
,
chose
to
oppose
him
.

During
the
Second
World
War
Groulx
,
like
many
Canadien
nationalists
,
spoke
in
favour
of
the
Vichy
regime
of
Philippe
Pétain
,
although
public
statements
to
this
effect
remained
rare
.

Groulx
and
other
intellectuals
settled
into
a
partial
alliance
with
Liberal
Party
of
Quebec
Leader
Adelard
Godbout
,
who
served
as
Premier
from
0000
to
0000
.

They
soon
broke
with
him
on
account
of
his
submission
to
the
federal
Liberals
.

Yet
in
0000
they
opposed
Duplessis
again
,
this
time
placing
their
hopes
in
another
new
party
,
the
Bloc
populaire
Canadien
,
led
by
André
Laurendeau
.

Future
Montreal
Mayor
Jean
Drapeau
was
part
of
this
young
party
,
which
soon
suffered
the
same
fate
as
the
previous
third
party
,
the
ALN
.

After
the
0000
election
,
the
Bloc
populaire
Canadien
disappeared
.

Economic
protectionism
Groulx
was
later
remembered
both
for
his
strong
case
in
favour
of
economic
reconquest
of
Quebec
by
French
Canadians
,
defense
of
the
French
language
,
and
pioneer
work
as
the
first
chair
of
Canadian
history
in
Quebec
(
Universite
de
Montreal
;
see
Ronald
Rudin
,
Making
History
in
Twentieth
Century
Quebec
,
Toronto
University
Press
,
0000
)
.

Rudin
underscores
Groulx
's
founding
role
in
scholarly
History
with
the
development
of
the
Montréal
History
Department
.

Groulx
founded
the
Institut
d'histoire
d'Amérique
française
in
0000
,
an
institute
located
in
Montreal
devoted
to
the
historical
study
of
Quebec
and
of
the
French
presence
in
the
Americas
and
the
publication
of
La
revue
d'histoire
de
l'Amérique
française
,
still
today
arguably
the
main
publication
for
professional
historians
in
Quebec
.

His
main
intellectual
contribution
was
to
create
a
rapprochement
between
nationalism
and
the
Catholic
religion
,
blunting
the
hostility
between
them
that
had
existed
in
the
nineteenth
century
.

Later
influence
Through
his
writings
and
teaching
at
the
university
,
and
his
association
with
the
intellectual
elite
of
Quebec
he
had
a
profound
influence
on
many
people
including
Michel
Chartrand
and
Camille
Laurin
although
the
many
young
intellectuals
he
influenced
often
did
not
share
his
conservative
leanings
,
such
as
his
personalist
successor
at
the
Université
de
Montréal
,
Guy
Frégault
.

Groulx
's
traditionalist
,
religious
form
of
Quebecois
nationalism
,
called
clerico-nationalism
continued
to
influence
Quebec
society
through
the
0000s
.

In
November
0000
,
Michel
Bock
won
the
Governor
General
’s
Literary
Award
in
the
category
of
Non-fiction
for
the
book
Quand
la

débordait
les

Lionel
Groulx
(

.

are
named
in
his
honor
.

Delisle-Richler
controversy
There
are
allegations
of
antisemitism
made
by
Mordecai
Richler
and
Esther
Delisle
against
several
pre-WW0
Quebec
intellectuals
,
including
Groulx
.

The
Art
Ross
Trophy
is
awarded
to
the
National
Hockey
League
player
who
leads
the
league
in
scoring
points
at
the
end
of
the
regular
season
.

It
was
presented
to
the
NHL
by
former
player
,
general
manager
,
and
head
coach
Art
Ross
.

The
trophy
has
been
awarded
sixty-one
times
to
twenty-five
players
since
its
inception
in
the
0000
–
00
NHL
season
.

The
current
holder
is
Martin
St.
Louis
,
who
scored
00
points
in
the
shortened
0000
–
00
NHL
season
.

The
scoring
title
came
nine
years
after
St.
Louis
won
the
Art
Ross
in
0000-00
–
the
longest
gap
between
wins
by
any
player
in
NHL
history
.

At
age
00
,
he
's
the
oldest
player
to
win
the
scoring
championship
,
displacing
Bill
Cook
,
who
was
00
when
he
won
it
while
playing
for
the
0000-00
New
York
Rangers
.

History
The
Art
Ross
Trophy
was
presented
to
the
National
Hockey
League
in
0000
by
Arthur
Howie
"
Art
"
Ross
,
former
general
manager
and
head
coach
of
the
Boston
Bruins
and
Hockey
Hall
of
Fame
inductee
as
a
player
.

Elmer
Lach
was
the
winner
of
the
first
Art
Ross
Trophy
,
which
was
awarded
at
the
conclusion
of
the
0000
–
00
NHL
season
.

Wayne
Gretzky
won
the
Art
Ross
Trophy
ten
times
,
including
seven
consecutive
,
during
his
00-year
NHL
career
.

Gordie
Howe
and
Mario
Lemieux
each
won
it
six
times
,
while
Phil
Esposito
and
Jaromir
Jagr
each
have
five
.

The
non-Canadian
player
with
the
most
awards
is
Czech
Jaromir
Jagr
.

Gretzky
is
the
only
player
to
win
the
trophy
for
more
than
one
team
and
Joe
Thornton
is
the
only
player
to
win
it
while
playing
for
two
different
teams
in
one
season
.

Stan
Mikita
is
the
only
player
in
NHL
history
to
win
the
Art
Ross
,
Hart
and
Lady
Byng
trophies
all
in
the
same
season
—
and
he
did
it
twice
(
0000
–
00
and
0000
–
00
)
.

Players
from
the
Pittsburgh
Penguins
have
won
the
trophy
00
times
(
within
00
seasons
)
;
players
from
the
Montreal
Canadiens
have
won
it
nine
times
;
and
the
Chicago
Blackhawks
have
seen
players
win
the
award
eight
times
.

From
0000
to
0000
,
Marcel
Dionne
and
Bryan
Trottier
were
the
only
single-time
winners
of
the
scoring
title
,
while
Stan
Mikita
,
Phil
Esposito
,
Bobby
Orr
,
Guy
Lafleur
,
Wayne
Gretzky
,
Mario
Lemieux
,
and
Jaromir
Jagr
had
won
it
on
multiple
occasions
.

For
two
decades
,
from
0000
to
0000
,
only
three
players
won
the
Art
Ross
Trophy
—
Wayne
Gretzky
,
Mario
Lemieux
,
and
Jaromir
Jagr
.

The
streak
ended
when
Jarome
Iginla
won
the
trophy
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
00-year-old
Sidney
Crosby
became
the
youngest
player
to
win
the
Art
Ross
Trophy
and
the
youngest
scoring
champion
in
any
major
North
American
professional
sport
by
scoring
000
points
,
meanwhile
,
at
almost
twice
this
age
,
Martin
St.
Louis
became
the
oldest
player
to
capture
the
Art
Ross
at
the
age
of
00
.

In
capturing
the
award
,
he
also
went
the
longest
between
scoring
titles
(
0
years
)
.

Only
one
defenseman
has
won
the
NHL
scoring
title
:
Bobby
Orr
did
it
in
0000
–
00
and
0000
–
00
.

Henrik
and
Daniel
Sedin
are
the
only
siblings
to
win
the
award
,
in
0000
–
00
and
0000
–
00
,
respectively
.

Since
0000
,
only
two
players
,
Pittsburgh
's
Evgeni
Malkin
,
and
Tampa
Bay
's
Martin
St.
Louis
have
won
the
award

History
Humble
beginnings
(
0000
–
0000
)
Present-day
Scranton
and
its
surrounding
area
had
been
inhabited
by
the
native
Lenape
tribe
,
from
whose
language
"
Lackawanna
"
(
or
"
le-can-hanna
"
,
meaning
"
stream
that
forks
"
)
is
derived
.

In
0000
,
Isaac
Tripp
,
known
as
the
area
's
first
white
settler
,
built
his
home
here
;
it
still
stands
in
the
city
's
Providence
section
.

More
settlers
from
New
England
came
to
the
area
in
the
late
00th
century
,
gradually
establishing
mills
and
other
small
businesses
in
a
village
that
became
known
as
Slocum
Hollow
.

Industrial
foundation
established
:
iron
,
coal
and
railroads
(
0000
–
0000
)
Though
anthracite
coal
was
being
mined
in
Carbondale
to
the
north
and
Wilkes-Barre
to
the
south
,
the
industries
that
precipitated
the
city
's
growth
were
iron
and
steel
.

In
0000
,
brothers
Selden
T.
and
George
W.
Scranton
founded
what
would
become
the
Lackawanna
Steel
Company
.

On
October
0
,
0000
,
the
Montour
Iron
Works
in
Danville
,
Pennsylvania
,
produced
the
first
iron
T-rail
s
made
in
America
,
offering
the
first
domestic
competition
to
British
exports
.

The
Scrantons
'
firm
followed
suit
two
years
later
,
making
rails
for
the
Erie
Railroad
in
New
York
state
,
and
soon
became
a
major
producer
.

In
0000
,
the
Scrantons
founded
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
and
Western
Railroad
(
DL&W
)
to
transport
iron
and
coal
products
from
the
Lackawanna
valley
.

The
Pennsylvania
Coal
Company
built
a
gravity
railroad
here
for
the
same
purpose
.

In
0000
,
the
Borough
of
Scranton
was
officially
incorporated
.

The
Delaware
and
Hudson
(
D&H
)
Canal
Company
,
which
had
its
own
gravity
railroad
from
Carbondale
to
Honesdale
,
built
a
steam
railroad
that
entered
Scranton
in
0000
.

Scranton
was
incorporated
as
a
city
of
00,000
in
0000
in
Luzerne
County
when
the
surrounding
boroughs
of
Hyde
Park
(
now
part
of
the
city
's
West
Side
)
and
Providence
(
now
part
of
North
Scranton
)
were
merged
with
Scranton
.

Twelve
years
later
,
the
city
became
the
county
seat
of
the
newly
formed
Lackawanna
County
.

The
nation
's
first
successful
,
continuously
operating
electrified
streetcar
(
trolley
)
system
was
established
in
the
city
in
0000
,
giving
it
the
nickname
"
The
Electric
City
"
.

Ten
years
later
,
the
city
's
various
streetcar
companies
were
consolidated
into
the
Scranton
Railway
Company
,
which
ran
trolleys
until
0000
.

By
0000
,
three
other
railroads
had
built
lines
to
tap
into
the
rich
supply
of
coal
in
and
around
the
city
,
including
the
Erie
Railroad
,
the
Central
Railroad
of
New
Jersey
and
finally
the
New
York
,
Ontario
and
Western
Railway
(
NYO&W
)
.

Underneath
the
city
,
a
network
of
coal
veins
was
mined
by
workers
who
were
given
jobs
by
the
wealthy
coal
barons
with
low
pay
,
long
hours
and
unsafe
working
conditions
.

Children
as
young
as
0
or
0
worked
00-hour
days
separating
slate
from
coal
in
the
breakers
.

In
the
late
0000s
,
Scranton
was
home
to
a
series
of
early
International
League
baseball
teams
.

Growth
and
prosperity
(
0000
–
0000
)
By
the
United
States
Census
of
0000
,
the
population
of
Scranton
was
about
000,000
,
making
it
the
00th-largest
U.S.
city
.

The
turn
of
the
00th
century
saw
many
beautiful
homes
of
Victorian
architecture
built
in
the
Hill
and
Green
Ridge
sections
of
the
city
.

In
0000
,
the
dwindling
local
iron
ore
supply
cost
the
city
the
industry
on
which
it
was
founded
.

The
Lackawanna
Steel
Company
moved
to
Lackawanna
,
New
York
,
where
iron
ore
was
more
readily
available
,
thanks
to
a
Great
Lakes
port
that
gave
it
easy
access
to
ore
from
Minnesota
.

Scranton
forged
ahead
as
the
center
of
Pennsylvania
's
anthracite
coal
industry
.

During
the
first
half
of
the
00th
century
,
it
became
home
to
many
groups
of
new
immigrants
from
Eastern
Europe
.

This
patchwork
still
survives
and
is
represented
by
the
Catholic
and
Orthodox
churches
that
primarily
dot
the
North
Scranton
,
West
Side
,
and
South
Side
neighborhoods
of
the
city
;
a
substantial
Jewish
community
was
established
as
well
.

In
0000
,
an
electric
interurban
railroad
known
as
the
Laurel
Line
was
started
,
and
two
years
later
connected
to
nearby
Wilkes-Barre
,
to
the
southwest
.

Working
conditions
for
miners
were
improved
by
the
efforts
of
labor
leaders
like
John
Mitchell
,
who
is
honored
with
a
statue
on
the
downtown
Courthouse
Square
.

Starting
in
the
early
0000s
,
the
Scranton
Button
Company
(
founded
in
0000
and
a
major
maker
of
shellac
buttons
)
became
one
of
the
primary
makers
of
phonograph
records
.

They
pressed
records
for
Emerson
(
whom
they
bought
in
0000
)
,
as
well
as
Regal
,
Cameo
,
Romeo
,
Banner
,
Domino
,
Conqueror
.

In
July
0000
,
the
company
merged
with
Regal
,
Cameo
,
Banner
,
and
the
U.S.
branch
of
Pathe
(
makers
of
Pathe
and
Perfect
)
to
become
the
American
Record
Corporation
.

By
0000
,
the
Scranton
company
was
also
pressing
records
for
Brunswick
,
Melotone
,
and
Vocalion
.

In
0000
,
the
company
was
acquired
by
Capitol
,
and
continued
to
produce
Capitol
Records
through
the
end
of
the
vinyl
era
.

By
the
mid-0000s
,
the
city
population
had
swelled
beyond
000,000
thanks
largely
to
the
growing
mining
and
silk
textile
industries
.

World
War
II
created
a
great
demand
for
energy
,
which
led
to
more
strip
mining
in
the
area
.

The
end
of
an
era
(
0000
–
0000
)
After
World
War
II
,
coal
lost
favor
to
oil
and
natural
gas
.

While
some
U.S.
cities
prospered
in
the
post-war
boom
,
the
fortunes
and
population
of
Scranton
(
and
the
rest
of
Lackawanna
and
Luzerne
Counties
)
began
to
diminish
.

Coal
production
and
rail
traffic
declined
rapidly
throughout
the
0000s
.

In
0000
,
the
Laurel
Line
ceased
passenger
service
.

The
Scranton
Transit
Company
,
whose
trolleys
had
given
the
city
its
nickname
,
transferred
all
operations
to
buses
as
the
0000
holiday
season
approached
.

In
0000
,
some
eastern
and
southern
parts
of
the
city
were
destroyed
by
the
floods
of
Hurricane
Diane
,
and
00
lives
were
lost
.

The
NYO&W
Railroad
,
which
depended
heavily
on
its
Scranton
branch
for
freight
traffic
,
was
abandoned
in
0000
.

The
Knox
Mine
Disaster
of
January
0000
erased
the
mining
industry
in
Northeastern
Pennsylvania
.

The
event
eliminated
thousands
of
jobs
as
the
waters
of
the
Susquehanna
River
flooded
the
mines
.

The
DL&W
Railroad
,
nearly
bankrupt
by
the
drop
in
coal
traffic
and
the
effects
of
Hurricane
Diane
,
merged
with
the
Erie
Railroad
in
0000
.

Scranton
had
been
the
hub
of
its
operations
until
the
Erie
Lackawanna
merger
,
when
it
was
no
longer
needed
in
this
capacity
;
it
was
another
severe
blow
to
the
labor
market
.

Mine
subsidence
was
a
spreading
problem
in
the
city
as
pillar
supports
in
abandoned
mines
began
to
fail
;
cave-ins
sometimes
consumed
entire
blocks
of
homes
.

The
area
was
then
scarred
by
abandoned
coal
mining
structures
,
strip
mines
,
and
massive
culm
dump
s.
During
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
the
silk
and
other
textile
industries
shrunk
as
jobs
moved
south
or
overseas
.

There
were
some
small
bright
spots
during
the
era
.

In
0000
,
businessman
Alex
Grass
opened
his
first
"
Thrif
D
Discount
Center
"
drugstore
on
Lackawanna
Avenue
in
downtown
Scranton
.

The
store
,
an
immediate
success
,
was
the
progenitor
of
the
Rite
Aid
drugstore
chain
.

In
0000
,
the
Secretary
of
Mines
for
Pennsylvania
suggested
that
so
many
underground
voids
had
been
left
by
mining
underneath
Scranton
that
it
would
be
"
more
economical
"
to
abandon
the
city
than
make
them
safe
.

During
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
many
downtown
storefronts
and
theaters
became
vacant
as
suburban
shopping
malls
became
the
dominant
venues
for
shopping
and
entertainment
.

Stabilization
and
restoration
(
0000
–
0000
)
There
has
been
an
emphasis
on
revitalization
since
the
mid-0000s
.

Local
government
and
much
of
the
community
at
large
have
adopted
a
renewed
interest
in
the
city
's
buildings
and
history
.

Aged
and
empty
properties
are
being
redesigned
and
marketed
as
tourist
attractions
.

The
Steamtown
National
Historic
Site
captures
the
area
's
once-prominent
position
in
the
railroad
industry
.

The
former
DL&W
train
station
was
restored
as
the
Radisson
Lackawanna
Station
Hotel
.

The
Electric
City
Trolley
Museum
was
created
next
to
the
DL&W
yards
that
the
Steamtown
NHS
occupies
.

The
Houdini
Museum
opened
in
Scranton
by
nationally
known
magician
Dorothy
Dietrich
in
0000
and
is
the
only
museum
in
the
world
dedicated
to
Harry
Houdini
.

The
museum
has
been
featured
on
more
national
television
than
other
NE
PA
attractions
combined
.

In
0000
,
Hilton
Hotels
&
Resorts
opened
the
Hilton
Scranton
Hotel
&
Conference
Center
at
the
corner
of
Adams
Street
&
Lackawanna
Street
in
the
heart
of
downtown
Scranton
.

Due
to
the
current
rage
of
paranormal
themed
televisions
shows
a
popular
downtown
historic
Scranton
Ghost
Walk
[
0
]
is
now
available
000
days
a
year
.

Other
attractions
responsible
for
recent
popularity
and
favorable
attention
to
the
Scranton
area
include
the
Snö
Mountain
ski
resort
(
formerly
Montage
Mountain
)
,
the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
Penguins
,
AHL
affiliate
of
the
Pittsburgh

,
the
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre
Rail
Riders
(
formerly
the
Scranton/Wilkes

Yankees
and
before
that
the
Red
Barons
)
,
AAA
affiliate
of
the
New

,
and
their
PNC

,
and
the
Toyota

at
Montage

.

Crisis
(
0000
)
According
to
The
Guardian
,
the
city
was
close
to
bankruptcy
in
July
0000
,
with
the
wages
of
all
municipal
officials
,
including
the
mayor
and
fire
chief
,
being
cut
to
$
0.00
/
hour
.

Financial
consultant
Gary
Lewis
,
who
lives
in
Scranton
,
was
quoted
as
estimating
that
"
on
0
July
the
city
had
just
$
0,000
cash
in
hand
.

History
of
Borough
of

The

contains
a
lead-contaminated
parcel
of
land
commonly
known
as
the
Marjol
Battery
site
.

Now
owned
by
Gould
Electronics
,
the
empty
land
was
a
former
battery
processing
facility
closed
in

.

Since
the
late
0000s
,
the
federal
United
States
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
the
state
DEP
have
worked
to
clean
up
contamination
in
adjacent
areas
,
but
a
final
remedy
for
the
site
itself
has
remained
on
hold
in
recent
years
,
as
local
officials
and
citizens
fight
with
the
government
agencies
and
Gould
over
the
best
solution
.

In
the
meantime
,
the
landowner
has
maintained
a
policy
of
basic
containment

monitoring
.

baseball
and
softball
programs
in
the
borough
.

,
formerly
held
on

Sunday
in

)
event
that
features

Club
and
parents
of
throop
athletes
,
to
produce
.

The
Makropulos
Affair
(
or
The
Makropoulos
Case
,
or
The
Makropulos
Secret
or
,
literally
,
The
Makropulos
Thing
;
(
Czech
Věc
Makropulos
)
is
a
three-act
opera
by
Czech
composer
Leoš
Janáček
.

The
libretto
,
based
on
a
play
of
the
same
name
by
Karel
Čapek
,
was
written
by
the
composer
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
Makropulos
Affair
was
his
penultimate
opera
and
,
like
much
of
his
later
work
,
it
was
inspired
by
his
infatuation
with
Kamila
Stösslová
,
a
married
woman
much
younger
than
himself
.

The
world
premiere
of
the
opera
was
given
at
the
National
Theatre
in
Brno
on
December
00
,
0000
,
conducted
by
František
Neumann
.

Composition
history
Janáček
's
operatic
version
was
written
between
0000
and
0000
.

He
had
seen
the
play
early
in
its
run
in
Prague
on
00
December
0000
,
and
immediately
saw
its
potential
.

He
entered
into
a
correspondence
with
Čapek
,
who
was
accommodating
towards
the
idea
,
although
legal
problems
in
securing
the
rights
to
the
play
delayed
work
.

When
these
problems
were
cleared
on
00
September
0000
,
Janáček
began
work
on
the
opera
straight
away
.

He
wrote
the
libretto
himself
,
and
by
December
0000
had
completed
the
first
draft
of
the
work
.

He
spent
another
year
refining
the
score
,
before
completing
it
on
0
December
0000
.

Musically
,
much
of
the
piece
has
little
in
the
way
of
thematic
development
,
instead
presenting
the
listener
with
a
mass
of
different
motifs
and
ideas
.

Janáček
's
writings
indicate
that
this
was
a
deliberate
ploy
to
give
musical
embodiment
to
the
disruptive
,
unsettling
main
character
Emilia
Marty/Elina
Makropulos
.

Only
at
the
end
of
the
final
act
,
when
Makropulos
'
vulnerability
is
revealed
,
does
the
music
tap
into
and
develop
the
rich
lyrical
vein
that
has
driven
it
throughout
.

It
is
often
argued
that
Emilia
Marty
,
like
the
other
female
heroes
in
Janáček
's
later
operas
,
stands
for
one
of
the
aspects
of
Kamila
Stösslová
,
the
woman
with
whom
he
was
in
love
for
the
last
decade
of
his
life
.

Marty
,
with
a
clever
and
manipulative
exterior
hiding
a
core
of
vulnerability
,
is
a
'
snapshot
'
of
Stösslová
,
like
the
coquettish
and
shy
Cunning
Little
Vixen
and
the
tragic
Káťa
Kabanová
.

Performance
history
Two
years
after
its
premiere
,
the
opera
was
given
in
Prague
,
and
also
in
Germany
in
0000
,
but
it
did
not
become
really
popular
until
a
production
by
the
Sadler
's
Wells
company
in
London
in
0000
.

While
performed
with
some
regularity
,
it
has
not
become
part
of
the
core
opera
repertory
in
the
same
way
as
have
Jenůfa
,
Káťa
Kabanová
or
The
Cunning
Little
Vixen
.

In
0000
,
the
San
Francisco
Opera
gave
the
first
performances
(
in
an
English
translation
)
of
the
opera
in
the
U.S.
with
Marie
Collier
in
the
lead
role
.

Other
notable
sopranos
who
have
performed
the
opera
include
Anja
Silja
,
Maralin
Niska
(
in
Frank
Corsaro
's
production

,
Karan

's
clerk

notes
that
the
probate
case
of
Gregor
v.
Prus
has
been
going
on
for
almost
a
century
.

Kolenatý
represents
the
middle-class
Gregors
against
the
wealthy
and
aristocratic
Prus
family
.

Albert
Gregor
comes
in
asking
about
the
case
,
Kolenatý
has
taken
it
to
the
Supreme
Court
,
but
has
not
returned
because
he
is
expecting
the
final
resolution
.

Vitek
's
daughter
Kristina
,
enters
.

She
is
a
young
singer
,
and
praises
Emilia
Marty
,
a
famous
singer
she
has
seen
rehearsing
and
admits
that
she
will
never
be
the
artist
Emilia
Marty
is
.

Kolenatý
returns
,
accompanied
(
surprisingly
)
by
Emilia
Marty
,
who
reviews
the
case
with
her
.

Baron
Joseph
Ferdinand
Prus
died
in
0000
,
leaving
no
will
or
legitimate
children
.

His
cousin
claimed
the
estate
,
but
so
did
Albert
's
ancestor
,
Ferdinand
Gregor
,
who
asserted
that
the
Baron
had
promised
the
estate
to
him
both
presenting
different
evidence
to
their
case
but
no
actual
will
.

Speaking
with
unusual
familiarity
of
these
long-ago
events
,
she
states
that
Ferdinand
Gregor
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
Baron
Joseph
(
who
was
a
very
centered
and
diligent
man
,
contradicting
Dr.
Kolenatý
's
description
of
the
man
)
and
opera
singer
Ellian
MacGregor
.

Kolenatý
says
that
the
case
seems
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
Prus
family
,
because
there
is
no
will
.

Emilia
asks
what
would
be
required
for
Albert
Gregor
to
win
,
and
Kolenatý
says
the
missing
will
.

Emilia
says
that
there
is
in
fact
a
will
and
proceeds
to
describe
an
old
cupboard
in
the
Prus
mansion
where
important
papers
were
kept
where
he
will
find
the
document
they
need
.

Kolenatý
thinks
Emilia
is
making
up
stories
,
but
Albert
insists
he
investigate
at
once
and
even
threatens
to
take
the
case
to
a
rival
lawyer
.

Kolenatý
leaves
,
and
Albert
tells
Emilia
that
if
he
does
not
get
the
estate
,
he
will
be
penniless
and
shoot
himself
.

He
is
already
infatuated
with
Emilia
,
and
tries
to
make
love
to
her
.

But
Emilia
,
bored
and
indifferent
,
coldly
refuses
him
.

However
,
she
asks
his
help
in
retrieving
a
document
that
will
be
found
with
the
will
.

Kolenatý
returns
with
Jaroslav
Prus
.

They
found
the
will
where
Emilia
said
it
would
be
,
and
Jaroslav
congratulates
Albert
on
his
victory
-
if
he
can
prove
that
Ferdinand
Gregor
was
the
Baron
's
illegitimate
son
.

Emilia
says
she
can
prove
that
.

accompanied

his

Kristina

Emilia
enters

spurns
them
all
,
including
Janek
,
who
falls
under
her
spell
,
and
Albert
,
who
brings
her
expensive
flowers
.

Old

Emilia
as
Eugenia
Montez

a
gypsy
woman
with
whom
he
had
an
affair
in

half
a
century
before

Eugenia
is
not

and
in
Spanish
,
calls
him
by
a
pet
name
and
asks
him
for

All
except
Jaroslav
leave

He
demands
an
explanation
of
her
strange
interest
in

family

and
reveals
that
the
mother
of
the
Baron
's

was

as
"

Makropulos
"
-
who
might
be
the

as
"
Ellian
MacGregor
"
,
whose
love
letters
he
has
read
,
Prus
describes
her
as
a
passionate
woman
with
probably
flexible
morals
,
to
which
Emilia
takes
an
offense
.

He
continues
saying
that
only
a
descendant
of
"
Ferdinand
Makropoulos
"
can
claim
the
estate
.

Emilia
offers
to
buy
a
mysterious
document
found

Jaroslav
refuses
and
leaves

Albert

again
pleads
his

,
but
Emilia
merely
falls
asleep
,
and
Albert
leaves
.

Janek
returns
,
and
Emilia
asks
him
to
get
the
document
for
her
.

Jaroslav
overhears
this
,
and
orders
Janek

Though
Jaroslav
was
disappointed
by
Emilia
's
coldness
,
he
gives
her
the
envelope
containing
the
document
.

They
are
informed
that
Janek
has
committed
suicide
due

his
infatuation

,

Emilia
is
absolutely
indifferent

hardly
has
time
to
express
his
anger
at
her
reaction
before
Count
Hauk-Šendorf
enters

he
has
left

and
plans

elope

,

enter

with
a
doctor
who
takes
Count
Hauk-Šendorf
away
.

Kolenatý
has
noticed
that
Emilia
's
handwriting
matches
that
of
"
Ellian
MacGregor
"
,
and
suspects
her
of
forgery
.

She
leaves
the
room
to
get
dressed
and
after
she
has
had
her
breakfast
,
she
will
clarify
everything
.

The
rest
of
the
party
begins
to
search
her
papers
and
belongings
.

The
searchers
find
many
documents
and
keepsakes
,
all
bearing
names
with
the
initials
"
E.M.
"
,
Jaroslav
says
that
the
handwriting
of
"
Elina
Makropulos
"
(
on
Ferdinand
's
birth
certificate
)
also
matches
that
of
Emilia
.

Emilia
comes
back
,
drunk
and
with
a
pistol
,
but
Albert
disarms
her
.

Emilia
at
last
decides
to
tell
the
truth
:
she
is
Elina
Makropulos
,
born
in
0000
,
daughter
of
Hieronymus
Makropulos
,
an
alchemist
in
Emperor
Rudolf
II
's
Court
,
who
ordered
him
to
prepare
a
potion
that
would
extend
his
life
,
when
it
was
ready
,
the
Emperor
ordered
his
alchemist
to
test
it
on
her
.

She
fell
into
a
coma
and
Hieronymus
was
sent
to
prison
.

After
a
week
Elina
woke
up
and
fled
with
the
formula
and
now
she
has
lived
for
three
centuries
on
an
itinerant
life
,
becoming
one
of
the
best
singers
of
all
time
.

To
conceal
her
longevity
,
she
has
assumed
many
identities
:
Eugenia
Montez
,
Ekaterina
Myshkin
,
Ellian
McGregor
,
and
others
.

She
confided
her
secret
to
Baron
Joseph
and
gave
him
the
formula
,
which
he
attached
to
his
will
for
his
son
.

The
potion
is
finally
wearing
off
.

Elina
wanted
the
formula
to
gain
another
000
years
of
life
.

As
the
potion
wears
off
and
the
first
signs
of
old
age
appear
on
her
face
,
they
come
to
believe
her
.

Elina
has
realized
that
perpetual
youth
has
led
her
to
exhausted
apathy
,
and
resolves
to
allow
death
to
come
naturally
to
her
,
understanding
that
a
sense
of
transcendence
and
purpose
come
from
a
naturally
short
span
of
life
.

Aging
rapidly
before
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
onlookers
,
she
offers
Kristina
the
formula
so
she
now
can
become
a
great
artist
herself
,
but
she
burns
it
in
a
candle
flame
.

Elina
expires
as
she
recites
the
first
words
of
the
Lord
's
Prayer
in
Greek
.

Lancaster
Township
is
a
civil
township
of
Lancaster
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

It
is
in
the
central
area
and
it
immediately
surrounds
Lancaster
City
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
township
population
was
00,000
.

Lancaster
Township
is
one
of
the
six
immediate
suburb
s
of
the
city
of
Lancaster
,
all
sharing
the
same
official
designation
as
Lancaster
,
Pennsylvania
by
the
United
States
Postal
Service
.

History
Lancaster
Township
was
established
in
0000
as
one
of
seventeen
original
townships
in
Lancaster
County
.

It
was
the
smallest
of
the
townships
with
its
boundaries
being
defined
by
the
Conestoga
River
,
Manor
Township
,
the
Little
Conestoga
Creek
,
(
East
)
Hempfield
Township
,
and
Manheim
Township
.

A
two-mile
square
was
later
cut
out
of
the
northern
part
of
Lancaster
Township
to
create
the
county
seat
of
Lancaster
City
.

The
creation
of
the
county
caused
an
influx
of
people
to
come
to
Lancaster
City
,
and
Lancaster
Township
,
its
closest
suburb
,
received
many
people
too
,
with
many
people
living
here
and
working
in
the
city
.

As
Lancaster
became
larger
and
more
prominent
,
larger
roads
and
railroads
needed
to
extend
out
to
its
suburbs
,
including
Lancaster
Township
.

The
town
even
had
its
own
canal
,
the
Conestoga
Navigation
Canal
on
the
Conestoga
River
.

Lancaster
Township
's
growth
was
slow
but
steady
,
with
about
000
people
joining
the
community
each
decade
prior
to
0000
.

Since
then
,
as
the
Industrial
Revolution
came
to
a
close
,
Lancaster
Township
has
been
transformed
into
a
mostly
residential
municipality
.

Geography
According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
township
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

It
is
bounded
by
the
Conestoga
River
to
the
south
and
east
,
and
its
tributary
,
the
Little
Conestoga
Creek
to
the
west
.

Most
of
the
township
lies
to
west
and
south
of
the
city
of
Lancaster
,
but
smaller
exclaves
of
the
township
lies
to
the
east
and
southeast
of
the
city
.

Its
neighboring
municipalities
are
Manheim
Township
,
the

,
East
Lampeter
Township
,
Pequea
Township
,
the
borough
of
Millersville
,
Manor
Township
,
and
East
Hempfield
Township
.

The
township
also
surrounds
the
village
of
Bausman
,
an
unincorporated
community
that
has
its
own
post
office
and
ZIP
code
(

)
,
while
the
township
is
covered
by

The
township
is
home
to
President
James
Buchanan
's
summer
residence
,
Wheatland
,
located
at
0000
Mariette
Avenue
.

The
0000
Federal-style
mansion
is
National
Historic
Landmark
and
has
been
restored
to
reflect
the
period
of
Buchanan
's
occupancy
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

Wheatland
is
featured
within
the
township
's
seal
.

Government
and
Politics
Lancaster
Township
is
governed
by
a
three-member
Board
of
Supervisors
,
who
serve
staggered
six-year
terms
.

The
current
supervisors
are
Tom
Schaller
(
chair
)
,
Benjamin
Bamford
(
vice-chair
)
and
Kathy
Wasong
(
treasurer
)
.

Their
terms
expire
at
the
end
of
0000
,
0000
,
and
0000
,
respectively
.

In
the
most
recent
municipal
election
on
November
0
,
0000
,
Tony
Allen
was
defeated
in
his
bid
for
a
fourth
term
as
supervisor
by
Democrat
Benjamin
Bamford
in
a
very
close
race
.

Initial
results
gave
Bamford
an
00-vote
margin
of
victory
,
or
less
than
one-half
of
one
percent
of
votes
cast
.

Unofficial
results
had
0,000
votes
for
Bamford
to
0,000
votes
for
Allen
.

After
00
registered
voters
petitioned
the
elections
board
,
a
later
manual
recount
increased
Bamford
's
margin
to
00
votes
out
of
0,000
votes
cast
,
with
0,000
votes
for
Bamford
to
Allen
's
0,000
(
00.0
%
to
00.0
%
)
.

In
a
county
with
a
strong
history
of
voting
for
Republicans
,
Bamford
's
victory
made
history
.

When
Bamford
takes
office
,
Lancaster
Township
will
be
the
first
township
in
the
county
to
be
governed
by
a
board
that
is
majority
Democratic
.

Optoelectronics
is
the
study
and
application
of
electronic
devices
that
source
,
detect
and
control
light
,
usually
considered
a
sub-field
of
photonics
.

In
this
context
,
light
often
includes
invisible
forms
of
radiation
such
as
gamma
ray
s
,
X-ray
s
,
ultraviolet
and
infrared
,
in
addition
to
visible
light

Optoelectronic
devices
are
electrical-to-optical
or
optical-to-electrical
transducer
s
,
or
instruments
that
use
such
devices
in
their
operation
.

Electro-optics
is
often
erroneously
used
as
a
synonym
,
but
is
in
fact
a
wider
branch
of
physics
that
deals
with
all
interactions
between
light
and
electric
field
s
,
whether
or
not
they
form
part
of
an
electronic
device
.

Optoelectronics
is
based
on
the
quantum

effects
of
light
on
electronic
materials
,

History
Manor
Township
takes
its
name
from
the
Manor
of
Conestoga
,
which
was
originally
surveyed
and
reserved
for
William
Penn
in
0000
.

There
is
evidence
that
William
Penn
visited
this
area
prior
to
0000
.

At
this
time
the
area
was
Native
American
territory
.

The
Susquehannocks
were
the
largest
tribe
in
the
Susquenhanna
Valley
with
the
center
of
their
community
in
the
Turkey
Hill
area
.

The
Quaker
government
had
surveyors
lay
off
a
large
area
bounded
by
the
Little
Conestoga
Creek
near
Millersville
,
to
the
Susquehanna
River
,
and
to
the
Conestoga
Creek
.

This
area
was
called
the
Manor
of
Conestoga
,
and
some
historians
believe
it
was
set
aside
as
a
domain
in
which
the
Indians
could
live
and
hunt
.

The
Manor
contained
00,000
acres
east
of
the
Susquehanna
River
.

For
the
most
part
the
land
was
flat
and
well
watered
,
and
the
soil
was
rich
and
fertile
.

William
Penn
had
reserved
a
0,000
acre
site
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
just
north
of
Turkey
Hill
for
his
New
Philadelphia
.

The
city
would
have
been
at
the
end
of
the
present
Blue
Rock
Road
.

Blue
Rock
Road
was
an
ancient
Native
American
trail
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
white
settlers
.

The
road
today
is
known
as
Route
000
as
it
leaves
Millersville
,
crosses
the
Little
Conestoga
and
heads
to
the
river
just
south
of
Washington
Boro
.

Blue
Rock
Ferry
,
which
operated
around
0000
,
was
located
at
the
end
of
Blue
Rock
Road
.

Blue
Rock
Road
had
great
significance
and
was
considered
the
first
gateway
to
the
west
.

Following
Penn
's
death
three
of
his
sons
assumed
control
of
the
Manor
in
the
early
0000s
.

The
Swiss-German
Mennonites
were
among
the
first
Europeans
to
occupy
the
subdivided
lots
.

.

One
thing
which
made
the
Manor
vastly
different
from
other
localities
in
Lancaster
County
at
this
period
was
the
existence
of
the
Indian
reservation
(
Indiantown
)
established
by
William
Penn.
.

It
remained
until
December
0000
when
the
Paxton
Boys
invaded
the
reservation
and
massacred
the
few
remaining
Indians
.

For
the
next
000
years
the
Township
was
subdivided
as
the
large
plantations
were
cut
into
smaller
tracts
to
accommodate
growing
families
.

The
iron
industry
came
to
the
Township
in
0000
when
the
Iron
Works
was
built
in
the
village
of
Safe
Harbor
.

The
T-shape
rail
was
the
principal
produce
of
the
mill
.

The
Civil
War
came
close
to
Manor
Township
in
0000
.

Governor
Curtin
called
every
able-bodied
man
to
enroll
for
the
defense
of
the
States
.

Citizens
of
Manor
and
Millersville
assembled
at
the
headquarters
at
Safe
Harbor
.

The
invasion
threat
to
Lancaster
County
ended
as
the
Columbia-Wrightsville
bridge
was
burned
and
Lee
's
army
was
defeated
at
Gettysburg
.

By
0000
the
population
of
Manor
Township
was
approximately
0,000
people
.

From
the
late
0000s
through
the
mid
0000s
Manor
Township
was
known
for
producing
fine
tobacco
crops
.

Manor
farmers
produced
more
tobacco
than
any
township
in
Lancaster
County
.

Churches
and
schools
were
built
as
the
area
continued
to
grow
.

The
railroad
along
the
western
boundary
of
the
township
enabled
industries
to
develop
,
including
a
woolen
factor
near
Safe
Harbor
,
match
factory
in
Safe
Harbor
,
and
an
implement
factor
near
Millersville
.

In
April
0000
construction
began
on
the
dam
for
the
Safe
Harbor
Water
Power
Corporation
and
was
completed
twenty
months
later
in
0000
.

Washington
Boro
's
official
merger
into
Manor
Township
in
August
0000
was
one
of
the
most
significant
changes
in
recent
memory
.

Today
,
Washington
Boro
remains
famous
for
the
tomatoes
grown
by
its
farmers
.

Most
of
Manor
Township
remains
rural
and
agricultural
in
use
.

The
land
is
considered
by
soil
scientists
to
be
as
fertile
as
any
in
the
United

History
In
0000
,
John
Carlysle
Stewart
,
a
civil
engineer
,
traveled
to
western
Pennsylvania
to
resurvey
the
"
donation
lands
"
resurveyed
lands
,
which
had
been
reserved
for
veterans
of
the
Revolutionary
War
.

He
discovered
that
the
original
survey
had
neglected
to
stake
out
approximately
at
the
confluence
of
the
Shenango
River
and
the
Neshannock
Creek
,
at
that
time
a
part
of
Allegheny
County
.

Claiming
the
land
for
himself
,
he
laid
out
what
was
to
become
the
town
of
New
Castle
.

Stewart
laid
out
the
town
of
New
Castle
in
April
0000
.

It
comprised
approximately
,
in
what
was
then
part
of
Allegheny
County
.

New
Castle
became
a
borough
in
0000
,
having
a
population
of
about
000
.

The
city
later
became
a
part
of
Mercer
County
.

On
April
0
,
0000
the
Governor
of
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
signed
an
act
creating
Lawrence
County
named
in
honor
of
U.S.
Navy
Captain
James
Lawrence
.

New
Castle
became
a
city
in
0000
and
was
headed
by
its
first
Mayor
,
Thomas
B.
Morgan
.

At
that
time
,
the
population
had
increased
to
about
0,000
.

In
0000
,
a
group
of
Old
Order
Amish
families
from
Mifflin
County
,
Pennsylvania
settled
just
north
of
New
Castle
in
New
Wilmington
.

Later
migrations
from
Holmes
County
,
Ohio
would
make
this
Amish
community
one
of
the
largest
in
Pennsylvania
.

Approximately
0,000
Amish
live
and
work
presently
in
the
townships
north
of
New
Castle
.

Business
in
New
Castle
began
to
flourish
in
the
early
00th
century
with
the
construction
of
the
canal
system
,
which
made
its
way
through
the
city
.

Numerous
manufacturing
plants
became
located
in
New
Castle
because
of
the
availability
of
transportation
facilities
and
ready
access
to
raw
material
markets
.

The
canal
system
was
later
supplemented
and
then
replaced
by
railroads
which
offered
greater
speed
and
capacity
for
freight
,
as
well
as
year
round
service
.

In
the
0000s
,
the
city
became
a
major
hub
of
the
Pittsburgh
and
Lake
Erie
Railroad
.

New
Castle
's
population
swelled
from
00,000
in
0000
to
00,000
in
0000
,
and
to
00,000
in
0000
,
as
immigrants
flocked
to
the
city
to
work
in
the
mills
and
nearby
limestone
quarries
,
particularly
from
Italy
.

Italian
laborers
of
the
era
were
frequent
victims
of
the
Black
Hand
society
,
which
employed
blackmail
and
extortion
to
rob
the
workers
of
their
pay
.

In
0000
the
headquarters
of
the
Black
Hand
for
the
entire
region
was
discovered
in
the
village
of
Hillville
a
few
miles
west
of
New
Castle
.

By
this
time
New
Castle
was
one
of
the
fastest
growing
cities
in
the
country
,
and
with
the
construction
of
the
largest
tin
plate
mill
in
America
,
the
city
became
the
tin
plate
capital
of
the
world
.

The
tin
plate
industry
marked
a
new
increase
the
city
's
prosperity
.

In
0000
New
Castle
was
linked
to
Pittsburgh
by
the
Pittsburgh
,
Harmony
,
Butler
and
New
Castle
Railway
,
an
interurban
trolley
line
.

Steel
and
paper
mills
,
foundries
,
a
bronze
bushing
factory
,
and
car-construction
plants
contributed
to
the
economy
.

In
addition
,
the
Shenango
China
produced
commercial
china
and
created
fine
china
for
the
White
House
,
including
dinnerware
for
Presidents
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
and
Lyndon
B.
Johnson
.

Other
ceramic
factories
produced
bathroom
fixtures
and
industrial
refractory
materials
.

In
the
0000s
,
New
Castle
enjoyed
its
greatest
prosperity
.

The
landscape
of
the
city
was
transformed
with
the
building
of
many
beautiful
structures
,
some
of
which
still
stand
,
such
as
The
Cathedral
,
St.
Mary
's
Church
,
and
the
Castleton
Hotel
.

The
city
also
established
its
identity
.

New
Castle
is
known
both
as
the
"
hot
dog
capital
of
the
world
"
and
the
"
fireworks
capital
of
America
.
"

Its
chili
dogs
are
the
product
of
Greek
immigrants
who
came
to
New
Castle
in
the
early
00th
century
and
established
restaurants
along
with
their
homes
.

The
notoriety
for
fireworks
is
credited
to
two
local
fireworks
companies
of
international
stature
,
S.
Vitale
Pyrotechnic
Industries
,
Inc.
(
Pyrotecnico
)
and
Zambelli
Internationale
.

In
the
0000s
the
city
,
along
with
most
cities
of
America
,
suffered
during
the
Great
Depression
.

During
this
trying
time
,
the
federal
government
established
the
Works
Progress
Administration
(
WPA
)
and
the
Civilian
Conservation
Corps
(
CCC
)
.

These
programs
offered
jobs
to
many
displaced
workers
.

Many
of
the
stone
walls
built
by
the
WPA
and
the
CCC
still
stand
as
a
reminder
of
the
historic
demise
of
the
economy
.

Industry
temporarily
surged
during
wartime
.

In
0000
,
the
population
peaked
at
00,000
,
but
became
part
of
the
rust
belt
,
with
population
dwindling
to
00,000
by
0000
.

History
Channel
Great
Race
.

Over

with
a

that
attracted
over

people
.

The
first
fireworks
manufacturer
in
New
Castle
was
Leopold
Fazzoni
,
who
owned
and
operated
the
Fazzoni
Brothers
Fireworks
Company
.

Mr.
Fazzoni
came
to
New
Castle
from
Italy
in
0000
and
worked
in
the
tin
mills
to
earn
enough
money
to
start
his
own
business
.

Mr.
Fazzoni
was
issued
the
first
certificate
for
fireworks
manufacturing
in
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
.

Of
the
people
who
worked
with
the
Fazzoni
family
,
many
founded
their
own
businesses
,
such
as
:
Paul
Rozzi
,
Jacob
Conti
,
Constantino
Vitale
,
and
Joseph
Zambelli
.

economic
challenges
,

Vitale
in
Italy
in
0000
,
Constantino
immigrated
to
New
Castle
continuing
his
business
there
in
the
0000s
.

Five
generations
of
the
Vitale
family
have
transformed
the
company
.

In
the
0000s
the
company
's
name
was
changed
to
Pyrotecnico
and
has
grown
to
be
a
world
leader
in
the
industry
.

Also

fireworks
companies
have

Culture
The
city
was
the
site
of
an
important
development
in
the
history
of
Warner
Bros.
studios
,
given
that
the
first
Warner
Bros.
theater
,
the
Cascade
,
opened
there
in
0000
.

(
The
Warners
,
most
of
whom
were
Polish
Jewish
immigrants
,
resided
in
Youngstown
.
)

The
theater
was
restored
and
reopened
in
0000
.

The
building
was
nearly
condemned
ten
years
earlier
after
a
wall
fell
on
the
sidewalk
near
East
Washington
Street
(
one
of
the
city
's
main
thoroughfares
)
before
its
historical
significance
was
discovered
,
saving
the
building
.

Municipal
officials
have
planned
recent
revitalization
efforts
around
the
former
theater
,
which
is
now
known
as
Cascade
Center
.

The
facility
currently
features
two
restaurants
and
a
local
stage
theater
,
and
plans
are
in
progress
to
turn
the
complex
into
New
Castle
's
version
of
Station
Square
in
Pittsburgh
.

This
revitalization
plan
,
however
,
will
focus
on
motion
pictures
rather
than
railroads
.

The
Cascade
Center
itself
is
named
after
Cascade
Park
,
located
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
's
East
Side
in
Shenango
Township
along
Pennsylvania
Route
00
.

A
former
trolley
park
,
it
was
restored
and
converted
into
a
regular
outdoor
park
in
the
0000s
with
a
few
historical
buildings
as
well
as
the
park
's
entrance
sign
restored
,
avoiding
the
fate
of
nearby
Idora
Park
in
Youngstown
.

The
park
hosts
the
annual
Back
to
the
00s
Weekend
classic
car
show
,
and
previously
hosted
the
similarly
themed
Thunder
in
the
Cascades
motorcycle
show
until
concerns
about
nudity
and
alcohol
use
at
the
event
as
opposed
to
the
more
family-friendly
Back
to
the
00
's
Weekend
had
the
event
moved
to
the
Lawrence
County
Fairgrounds
in
nearby
Hickory
Township
in
the
early
00st
century
.

The
New
Castle
Playhouse
,
a
community
theatre
,
is
located
along
Long
Avenue
and
puts
on
several
shows
a
year
,
and
is
one
of
the
only
such
theatres
between
Youngstown
and
theatre-rich
Pittsburgh
.

The
Old
Princeton
School
,
located
nearby
,
has
been
the
venue
for
rock
concerts
.

New
Castle
is
also
a
short
drive
from
McConnells
Mill
State
Park
in
Slippery
Rock
Township
and
neighboring
Moraine
State
Park
in
Muddy
Creek
Township
in

County
.

In
the

,
New
Castle
,
Pennsylvania
is
referenced
as
the
"
fireworks
capital
of

.
"

New
Castle
has
a
large
Arab-American
population
whose
culture
is
visible
throughout
the
community
.

Large
numbers
of
Lebanese
and
Syrian
immigrants
were
attracted
by
the
city
's
prosperity
in
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
.

Their
culture
is
especially
visible
in
the
local
cuisine
,
which
makes
popular
use
of
items
such
as
stuffed
grape
leaves
,
lamb
on
the
rod
,
kibbe
,
and
garlic
sauce
.

Although
many
other
Rust
Belt
cities
contain
large
Arab-American
populations
,
New
Castle
is
unique
for
its
large
population
of
Alawite
Muslims
from
Syria
.

The
Muslim
community
of
the
city
has
a
mosque
on
the
East
Side
of

;
Lawrence
County
did
not
yet
exist
.

Shenango
later
became
one
of
Lawrence
County
's
original
townships
and
quickly
became
one
of
the
most
populous
areas
,
because
the
land
was
suitable
for
many
different
purposes
.

One
of
the
first

to
live
in

was
William
Carins

goods
.

bought
up
large
portions
of

the
township
under
assumed
names
for
pennies
an
acre
.

He
later
resold
the
land
for
a
profit
,
and
the
small
town
of
Chewton
was
later
named
after
him
.

Transportation
Residential
Shenango
Township
is
made
up
of
several
smaller
residential
neighborhoods
which
were
built
by
local
developers
over
the
last
00
years
.

These
neighborhoods
are
connected
by
the
current
state
local
road
system
in
the
township
.

Shenango
saw
its
first
residential
developments
in
the
late
0000s
and
0000s
with
the
construction
of
most
of
the
homes
that
can
be
found
today
in
Ridgewood
Court
and
Willowhurst
Circle
.

These
two
developments
were
built
at
the
same
time
that
a
new
high
school
was
being
constructed
to
serve
the
community
.

The
0000s
and
0000s
saw
limited
residential
development
throughout
the
township
,
possibly
due
to
the
struggling
local
economy
at
the
time
.

The
0000s
through
the
present
have
shown
a
great
turnaround
for
the
township
,
with
the
construction
of
several
residential
developments
.

Single
family
developments
such
as
Woodland
Hills

Orchardale
Estates
Phase
I
,
Jason
's
Woods
Phase

Hidden
Lakes
Phase
I
have
led
to
a
significant
population
growth
in
Shenango
Township
over
the
last
00
years
.

The
construction
of
townhomes
and
condos
in
The
Fields
and
Shenango
Greens
has
added
to
the
diversity
of
residences
in
Shenango
Township
.

Volant
is
a
borough
in
Lawrence
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
land
on
which
the
borough
of
Volant
currently
sits
on
was
bought
from
the
Native
Americans
in
0000
.

The
first
gristmill
was
built
on
Neshannock
Creek
in
0000
,
upstream
from
the
current
site
.

It
was
abandoned
after
a
few
years
,
and
a
new
mill
was
built
in
0000
at
its
current
location
.

In
0000
,
J.P.
Locke
purchased
the
mill
and
of
land
and
began
laying
out
a
settlement
of
00
lots
,
which
he
called
Lockeville
.

With
the
help
of
the
railroad
,
his
attempts
to
create
a
settlement
were
successful
.

Lockeville
began
to
grow
and
prosper
,
and
in
June
0000
the
settlement
changed
its
name
to
Volant
and
was
incorporated
as
a
self-governing
unit
.

The
first
store
was
built
in
0000
by
John
and
William
Graham
.

By
the
turn
of
the
00th
century
the
village
was
a
bustling
commercial
community
.

Thanks
to
the
New
Castle
-
Franklin
railroad
Volant
became
a
popular
shopping
district
.

The
mill
remained
the
nucleus
of
the
town
.

Because
of
Volant
's
rural
location
there
was
a
livery
stable
,
two
harness
shops
,
a
blacksmith
and
a
veterinarian
,
as
well
as
some
shops
.

In
addition
,
there
was
a
college
which
attracted
students
from
the
surrounding
communities
.

As
the
town
progressed
toward
establishing
larger
business
ventures
,
a
stone
quarry
was
begun
around
0000
,
as
well
as
a
lumber
mill
and
brick
company
.

The
growing
need
for
petroleum
spurred
an
oil
boom
north
of
Volant
.

The
drilling
continued
until
the
beginning
of
World
War
I
.

With
the
Great
Depression
came
a
gradual
decline
of
the
economy
.

As
the
economy
worsened
the
business
district
diminished
to
almost
nothing
.

The
mill
,
which
was
primarily
responsible
for
Volant
's
success
,
closed
its
doors
in
the
early
0000s
,
and
the
trains
stopped
running
through
Volant
in
0000
.

Volant
soon
became
forgotten
and
returned
to
its
rural
roots
.

In
0000
,
a
renaissance
began
with
the
old
mill
as
its
centerpiece
.

Opening
its
doors
for
the
first
time
in
over
00
years
as
a
country
gift
and
antique
store
,
it
paved
the
way
for
a
business
revival
that
still
continues
.

Encouraged
by
its
success
,
other
shops
were
opened
on
Main
Street
.

After
several
years
of
rapid
growth
,
there
are
now
over
00
shops
and
restaurants
,
turning
Volant
from
a
sleepy
little
village
into
one
of
western
Pennsylvania
's
most
popular
tourist
attractions
.

Cornwall
is
a
borough
in
Lebanon
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

It
is
part
of
the
Lebanon
,
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Cornwall
was
founded
by
Peter
Grubb
in
0000
.

Peter
,
a
Chester
County
stonemason
,
came
to
Lancaster
County
around
0000
in
search
of
building
materials
.

First
building
his
house
and
then
a
store
,
he
discovered
very
high
quality
magnetite
iron
ore
nearby
and
decided
to
mine
for
it
,
acquiring
by
0000
and
over
by
0000
when
mining
was
initiated
.

He
called
it
the
Cornwall
Iron
Mines
after
his
father
's
birthplace
in
Cornwall
,
England
.

The
Cornwall
Iron
Mines
,
also
known
as
Cornwall
Banks
,
turned
out
to
be
the
largest
United
States
'
iron
deposit
east
of
Lake
Superior
,
and
were
once
the
largest
open-pit
iron
mine
in
the
world
.

They
were
mined
continuously
until
0000
,
totaling
000
uninterrupted
years
of
production
.

Finding
the
necessary
components
nearby
for
making
iron
(
water
,
limestone
and
timber
for
charcoal
)
,
Grubb
built
the
Cornwall
Iron
Furnace
and
began
production
in
0000
.

The
operation
also
included
the
Hopewell
Forges
on
nearby
Hammer
Creek
.

Peter
Grubb
did
not
stay
long
to
run
the
operation
,
but
leased
it
out
in
0000
for
00
years
and
returned
to
Wilmington
,
Delaware
.

In
0000
Peter
's
sons
Curtis
and
Peter
Jr.
took
over
the
operation
,
and
in
0000
it
passed
to
Robert
Coleman
and
his
family
.

Cornwall
Furnace
was
in
production
from
0000
until
0000
,
and
appears
today
much
as
it
was
when
production
ended
.

In
0000
the
Coleman
family
deeded
the
property
to
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
and
it
is
now
a
designated
National
Historic
Landmark
open
to
the
public
.

Eventually
the
whole
town
became
known
as
Cornwall
.

It
was
incorporated
as
a
township
on
October
00
,
0000
after
having
been
a
part
of
Lancaster
County
and
for
a

of
Dauphin

History
The

German-Swiss
Protestants
,
particularly
Lutherans
,
who
began
clearing
and
farming
the
land
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Even
today
,
most
residents
can
trace
their
ancestry
to
one
or
more
of
those
early
settlers
.

The
native
Indian
population
was
quickly
driven
north
into
the
Appalachian
Mountains
,

conflicts
between
natives
and
settlers
were
recorded
as
late
as
0000
.

,
except
for
the
southern
edge
,
which
was
incorporated
into
the
town
of
Annville
in
0000
.

The
main
industry
has
always
been
farming
.

Many
of
the
farms
,
dairy
and
livestock
,
have
passed
from
generation
to
generation
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
.

The
countryside
is
dotted
with
small
residential
communities
,
the
largest
of
which
are
Bellegrove
,
Water
Works
,
and
Steelstown
.

Apart
from
a
few
family-owned
businesses
,
the
only
major
employer
is
a
limestone
quarry
,
which
mines
the
high-calcium
geological
formation
known
as
the
Annville
Belt

Palmyra
is
a
borough
in
Lebanon
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

It
is
part
of
the
Lebanon
,
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

Geography
Palmyra
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States
Census
Bureau
,
the
borough
has
a
total
area
of
,
all
of
it
land
.

Palmyra
is
located
in
the
Lebanon
Valley
between
Annville
and
Hershey
.

Situated
on
the
western
edge
of
Lebanon
County
,
the
borough
is
west
of
Lebanon
,
and
east
of
Harrisburg
.

The
village
of
Campbelltown
is
only
south
of
Palmyra
.

Although
no
water
source
runs
directly
through
the
borough
,
the
Killinger
,
Quittapahilla
,
Spring
,
and
Swatara
Creeks
are
all
nearby
.

Geology
Geologist
William
E.
Kochanov
wrote
an
extensive
report
on
the
geology
of
the
Palmyra
area
as
part
of
the
0000
publication
,
Karst
Geohazards
.

In
his
article
,
Kochanov
discusses
how
the
geology
of
the
region
contributes
to
the
high
number
of
sinkhole
s
found
in
the
area
.

Palmyra
lies
in
the
eastern
section
of
the
Great
Valley
,
locally
known
as
the
Lebanon
Valley
.

The
specific
formation
beneath
Palmyra
is
an
Ordovician
Epler
Formation
,
characterized
by
a
high
number
of
surface
depressions
and
sinkholes
.

These
features
serve
as
natural
drains
,
allowing
any
water
on
the
surface
to
permeate
the
soil
and
run
underground
into
water
tables
or
into
local
springs
or
creeks
.

The
development
of
the
borough
has
interrupted
the
natural
drainage
systems
present
in
the
Epler
Formation
.

Palmyra
is
,
in
reality
,
a
waterless
community
.

All
of
the
natural
drainage
ways
,
including
the
Killinger
,
Quittapahilla
,
Spring
and
Swatara
Creeks
,
lie
outside
the
borough
’s
municipal
borders
.

The
storm
water
runoff
is
directed
outside
the
borough
via
a
multitude
of
ways
,
and
it
is
these
discharge
areas
in
which
the
appearance
of
sinkholes
is
most
prevalent
.

Residents
and
legislators
met
in
October
0000
to
discuss
possible
solutions
to
the
recurring
sinkhole
problems
.

The
installation
of
a
storm
sewer
system
was
widely
supported
,
but
the
estimated
$
00
Million
cost
was
a
major
hurdle
.

Since
the
meeting
,
several
projects
have
been
introduced
to
correct
some
of
the
water
flow
problems
of
the
borough
.

Despite
their
efforts
,
sinkholes
continue
to
create
headaches
for
the
people
of
Palmyra
.

The
once
Palmyra-based
,
hard-rock
band
Adrenaphine
released
a
song
entitled
Sinkhole
on
their
0000
album
Lake
of
the
Dead
.

The
song
's
lyrics
expressed
feelings
of
dislike
for
the
town
and
some
of
its
inhabitants
.

History
Early
Settlement
The
land
on
which
Palmyra
rests
was
originally
home
to
the
Lenape
and
Susquehannock
tribes
.

The
first
European
explorers
and
traders
came
to
the
region
around
0000
.

Settlers
were
drawn
to
the
area
because
of
its
rich
land
and
abundance
of
fish
and
game
.

Additionally
,
being
part
of
William
Penn
’s
colony
,
his
charter
providing
civil
rights
and
religious
freedom
also
attracted
settlers
to
the
area
.

Johannes
Palm
,
whose
name
is
often
anglicized
to
John
Palm
,
is
given
credit
for
founding
Palmyra
.

He
was
a
prominent
figure
in
the
early
days
of
the
community
,
serving
as
a
doctor
and
soldier
in
the
Revolutionary
War
.

In
the
beginning
of
its
colonization
,
many
of
Pennsylvania
’s
settlers
occupied
the
land
not
through
acquiring
the
legal
rights
,
but
by
building
on
any
unclaimed
land
they
found
,
or
squatting
.

The
squatters
came
to
the
Palmyra
area
between
0000
and
0000
.

Because
the
squatters
had
no
official
documents
stating
when
they
came
to
the
land
,
it
is
difficult
to
precisely
trace
family
migrations
to
and
from
the
area
.

From
looking
at
what
records
do
exist
,
and
by
the
people
still
living
in
the
Palmyra
area
,
it
is
clear
that
the
first
settlers
to
live
near
Palmyra
came
from
two
distinct
nationalities
,
the
Scotch-Irish
and
the
German
Palatinates
.

The
Scotch-Irish
immigrants
left
their
homelands
due
to
a
number
of
political
,
economic
and
religious
reasons
.

As
expected
,
they
were
clannish
,
and
tended
not
to
mix
with
the
other
ethnic
groups
settling
the
area
at
the
same
time
.

They
were
also
politically
minded
,
and
became
involved
in
local
governments
quickly
after
settling
in
the
area
.

A
majority
of
the
Scotch-Irish
were
Presbyterian
,
and
they
established
several
churches
as
they
moved
westward
across
the
state
.

Examples
of
the
churches
they
built
include
Donegal
in
Lancaster
County
,
Derry
near
Hershey
,
Paxtang
near
Harrisburg
,
and
Silver
Spring
near
Carlisle
.

As
the
years
passed
,
many
of
the
Scotch-Irish
continued
westward
,
leaving
the
Lebanon
Valley
.

Of
the
first
Scotch-Irish
settlers
in
the
Palmyra
area
,
the
surnames
of
Aspey
,
Campbell
,
Caruthers
,
Ewing
,
Galbraith
,
McCallen
,
McClure
,
McCord
,
Mitchell
,
Sawyer
,
Walker
and
Wilson
are
recorded
.

The
German
Palatinates
who
settled
in
Pennsylvania
,
erroneously
known
as
the
Pennsylvania
Dutch
,
also
left
their
homelands
for
a
number
of
reasons
.

Politically
they
had
been
oppressed
in
the
old
country
,
and
economically
they
were
poor
.

They
were
also
gravely
persecuted
for
their
religious
beliefs
.

Like
the
Scotch-Irish
,
the
Germans
kept
to
themselves
and
did
not
interfere
with
settlers
of
other
backgrounds
.

Throughout
the
parts
of
Pennsylvania
that
had
already
been
settled
,
German
was
the
prominently
spoken
language
,
surpassing
English
.

This
encouraged
more
German
settlers
to
lay
down
roots
in
Pennsylvania
more
so
than
in
the
other
colonies
.

Most
of
the
German
settlers
were
farmers
,
and
they
flourished
in
rural
areas
.

These
Germans
saw
farming
as
a
way
of
life
,
and
tended
to
be
conservative
,
religious
,
frugal
and
hard
working
people
.

Unlike
the
Scotch-Irish
,
the
Germans
were
not
politically
minded
,
and
they
had
no
qualms
with
the
English
governing
them
.

A
majority
of
the
Germans
did
not
leave
Pennsylvania
,
but
stayed
to
work
the
rich
soil
.

Of
the
first
German
settlers
in
the
Palmyra
area
,
the
surnames
of
Bindnagle
,
Bowman
,
Carmany
,
Deininger
,
Early
,
Forney
,
Gingrich
,
Hemperly
,
Hetrick
,
Kettering
,
Killinger
,
Naftzger
,
Nye
,
Ober
,
Ricker
,
and
Zimmerman
are
recorded
.

The
Palmyra
area
,
as
well
as
the
entire
western
edge
of
the
European
colonies
,
was
susceptible
to
attack
from
the
tribes
of
natives
living
in
the
region
.

In
their
histories
of
Lebanon
County
,
Rupp
and
Egle
note
many
raids
that
took
place
in
what
is
now
northern
Lebanon
County
.

In
0000
,
the
Provincial
government
decided
to
build
a
chain
of
forts
stretching
from
the
Susquehanna
River
at
Harrisburg
in
the
west
to
the
Delaware
River
at
Easton
in
the
east
.

These
forts
were
built
at
regular
intervals
,
roughly
ten
to
fifteen
miles
(
00
km
)
apart
,
and
in
any
major
gaps
along
the
mountains
.

One
of
these
forts
,
Fort
Swatara
,
was
built
by
Capt.
Frederick
Smith
near
modern-day
Inwood
where
the
Swatara
Creek
flows
through
the
Blue
Mountain
.

By
the
end
of
the
French
and
Indian
War
in
0000
,
the
frequency
and
intensity
of
native
attacks
diminished
.

Growth
of
Palmstown
Transportation
from
one
settlement
to
the
next
was
essential
if
either
settlement
wanted
to
grow
.

Most
of
the
early
settlers
built
their
homes
along
the
road
(
now
US
000
)
leading
from
Millerstown
(
now
Annville
)
to
Derry
(
now
Hershey
)
.

Other
important
roads
that
crossed
the
Palmyra
area
include
the
road
which
led
from
the
Bindnagle
settlement
to
Campbelltown
(
now
PA
000
)
,
and
the
Downingtown
,
Ephrata
and
Harrisburg
Pike
,
which
was
known
as
the
Horseshoe
Pike
(
now
US
000
)
.

With
the
incorporation
of
Harrisburg
as
the
State
Capital
in
0000
,
even
more
travelers
began
to
come
to
the
area
.

A
direct
route
from
Reading
to
Harrisburg
opened
in
0000
.

Known
as
the
Berks
and
Dauphin
Turnpike
,
U.S.
Route
000
ran
directly
through
Palmyra
,
and
employed
the
settlement
’s
only
real
street
,
Main
St.
With
the
opening
of
these
routes
,
more
and
more
traffic
moved
through
the
Palmyra
area
.

The
passage
of
more
travelers
encouraged
taverns
and
hotels
to
be
built
in
Palmyra
to
accommodate
them
.

In
the
first
decades
of
the
00th
century
,
Palmyra
had
five
taverns
and
three
hotels
to
serve
the
needs
of
those
moving
through
the
area
.

Blacksmith
shops
,
general
stores
and
other
small
business
also
began
to
pop
up
in
Palmyra
to
serve
both
travelers
and
locals
alike
.

The
U.S.
Mail
also
began
to
arrive
in
Palmyra
.

The
settlement
’s
Post
Office
was
established
on
April
0
,
0000
.

The
name
of
the
town
submitted
to
the
Postal
Service
was
“
Palmstown
”
,
in
honor
of
Johannes
Palm
.

Yet
in
the
following
year
,
there
are
records
of
the
settlement
being
referred
to
as
“
Palmyra
”
,
most
likely
referencing
the
Roman
outpost
of
Palmyra
in
Syria
.

The
exact
date
of
the
name
change
,
and
the
reason
for
the
change
,
remains
one
of
the
town
’s
mysteries
.

Both
names
were
used
throughout
the
early
00th
century
.

The
demand
of
greater
speed
and
tonnage
of
goods
being
moved
prompted
the
building
of
the
Union
Canal
.

Completed
in
0000
,
the
Union
Canal
connected
the
Schuylkill
River
at
Reading
to
the
Susquehanna
River
at
Middletown
.

The
canal
passed
just
north
of
Palmyra
,
and
the
settlement
’s
citizens
benefited
from
the
increased
traffic
.

The
canal
was
later
widened
to
allow
larger
boats
to
pass
through
in
0000
.

The
Age
of
Steam
also
came
to
Palmyra
in
0000
,
as
the
first
locomotives

move
to
the
Palmyra
area
.

In
0000
,
the
Lebanon
Valley
Street
Railway
Company
was
formed
to
provide
transit
across
the

in
Palmyra
.

This
trolley
connected
lasted
until
0000
,
when

History
Richland
is
unusual
in
that
an
active
railroad
crossing
intersects
the
town
square
.

Further
,
the
two
streets
that

,
Main

,
are
the
only
streets
linking

As

that

Allentown
was
named
the
00th
most
conservative
city
in
America
by
the
non-partisan
Bay
Area
Center
.

History
Founding
The
area
that
is
today
the
center
of
Allentown
was
laid
out
as
Northampton
Town
in
0000
by
William
Allen
,
a
wealthy
shipping
merchant
,
former
mayor
of
the
city
of
Philadelphia
and
then-Chief
Justice
of
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
.

The
property
was
part
of
a
plot
Allen
purchased
on
September
00
,
0000
from
his
business
partner
Joseph
Turner
,
who
was
assigned
the
warrant
to
the
land
by
Thomas
Penn
,
son
of
William
Penn
,
on
May
00
,
0000
.

The
tract
was
originally
surveyed
on
November
00
,
0000
.

A
subsequent
survey
done
in
0000
by
David
Schultz
for
a
road
from
Easton
to
Reading
,
of
which
present-day
Union
and
Jackson
streets
were
links
,
shows
the
location
of
a
log
house
owned
by
Allen
,
situated
near
the
western
bank
of
the
Jordan
Creek
,
which
was
believed
to
have
been
built
around
0000
.

Used
primarily
as
a
hunting
and
fishing
lodge
,
here
Allen
entertained
prominent
guests
including
his
brother-in-law
,
James
Hamilton
,
and
colonial
governor
John
Penn
.

The
original
plan
for
the
town
,
now
in
the
archives
of
the
Historical
Society
of
Pennsylvania
,
comprised
forty-two
city
blocks
and
consisted
of
000
lots
,
mostly
in
width
and
in
depth
.

The
town
was
located
between
present-day
Fourth
and
Tenth
Streets
,
and
Union
and
Liberty
Streets
.

Many
streets
on
the
original
plan
were
named
for
Allen
's
children
:
Margaret
(
present-day
Fifth
Street
)
,
William
(
now
Sixth
)
,
James
(
now
Eighth
)
,
Ann
(
now
Ninth
)
and
John
(
now
Walnut
)
.

Allen
Street
(
now
Seventh
)
was
named
for
Allen
himself
,
and
was
the
main
thoroughfare
.

Hamilton
Street
was
named
for
James
Hamilton
.

Gordon
Street
was
named
for
Sir
Patrick
Gordon
,
Deputy
Governor
of
Colonial
Pennsylvania
from
0000
–
0000
.

Chew
Street
was
named
for
Benjamin
Chew
,
and
Turner
Street
was
named
for
Allen
's
business
partner
,
Joseph
Turner
.

Allen
hoped
that
Northampton
Town
would
displace
Easton
as
the
seat
of
Northampton
County
and
also
become
a
commercial
center
due
to
its
location
along
the
Lehigh
River
and
its
proximity
to
Philadelphia
.

Allen
gave
the
property
to
his
son
James
in
0000
.

Three
years
later
,
in
0000
,
James
built
a
summer
residence
,
Trout
Hall
,
in
the
new
town
,
near
the
site
of
his
father
's
former
hunting
lodge
.

On
March
00
,
0000
,
the
town
was
formally
incorporated
as
the
Borough
of
Northamptown
.

On
March
0
,
0000
,
Lehigh
County
was
formed
from
the
western
half
of
Northampton
County
,
and
Northampton
Town
was
selected
as
the
county
seat
.

The
town
was
officially
renamed
"
Allentown
"
on
April
00
,
0000
,
after
years
of
popular
usage
.

Allentown
was
formally
incorporated
as
a
city
on
March
00
,
0000
.

Liberty
Bell
and
the
American
Revolutionary
War
Allentown
holds
historical
significance
as
the
location
where
the
Liberty
Bell
(
then
known
as
the
Pennsylvania
State
House
bell
)
was
successfully
hidden
from
the
British
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.

After
George
Washington
's
defeat
at
the
Battle
of
Brandywine
on
September
00
,
0000
,
the
revolutionary
capital
of
Philadelphia
was
defenseless
,
and
that
city
prepared
for
British
attack
.

The
Supreme
Executive
Council
of
the
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania
ordered
that
eleven
bells
,
including
the
State
House
bell
and
the
bells
from
Philadelphia
's
Christ
Church
and
St.
Peter
's
Church
,
be
taken
down
and
removed
from
the
city
to
prevent
the
British
,
who
would
melt
the
bells
down
to
cast
into
cannon
s
,
from
taking
possession
of
them
.

The
bells
were
transported
north
to
Northampton-Towne
,
and
hidden
in
the
basement
of
the
Old
Zion
Reformed
Church
,
in
what
is
now
center
city
Allentown
.

Today
,
a
shrine
and
museum
in
the
church
's
basement
,
known
as
the
Liberty
Bell
Museum
,
marks
the
spot
where
the
bell
was
hidden
.

After
the
Battle
of
Trenton
on
December
00
,
0000
,
Hessian
prisoners-of-war
were
kept
in
the
vicinity
of
present-day
Seventh
and
Gordon
Streets
.

The
Old
Zion
Reformed
Church
,
and
a
house
near
James
(
now
Eighth
)
and
Hamilton
Streets
,
served
as
hospitals
for
injured
and
sick
Continental
Army
troops
.

In
0000
,
a
factory
manufacturing
paper
cartridge
s
for
musket
s
was
relocated
here
from
nearby
Bethlehem
.

That
same
year
,
a
shop
of
sixteen
armorers
was
established
along
the
Little
Lehigh
Creek
,
and
employed
in
the
repair
of
weapons
and
the
manufacture
of
saddle
s
and
scabbard
s.
American
Industrial
Revolution
Prior
to
the
0000s
,
Allentown
was
a
small
town
with
only
local
markets
.

The
arrival
of
the
Lehigh
Canal
,
however
,
expanded
the
city
's
commerce
and
industrial
capacity
greatly
.

With
this
,
the
town
underwent
significant
industrialization
,
ultimately
becoming
a
major
center
for
heavy
industry
and
manufacturing
.

While
Allentown
was
not
as
large
as
neighboring
Bethlehem
at
the
time
,
the
local
iron
industry
—
which
included
the
Allentown
Iron
Company
(
established
0000
)
and
the
Allentown
Rolling
Mills
(
established
0000
)
—
employed
the
majority
of
Allentown
's
workforce
.

Railroads
,
such
as
the
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
,
were
vital
to
the
movement
of
raw
materials
and
finished
goods
,
and
employed
a
significant
workforce
during
this
time
.

This
period
of
rapid
economic
growth
in
the
region
was
halted
by
two
events
,
the
Panic
of
0000
and
the
Long
Depression
.

In
addition
to
the
iron
and
railroad
industries
,
Allentown
also
had
a
strong
tradition
in
the
brewing
of
beer
and
was
home
to
several
notable
breweries
,
including
the
Horlacher
Brewery
(
founded
0000
,
closed
0000
)
,
the
Neuweiler
Brewery
(
founded
0000
,
closed
0000
)
and
Schaefer
Beer
,
whose
brewery
was
later
owned
by
Pabst
Brewing
Company
and
Guinness
but
is
now
owned
by
the
Boston
Beer
Company
,
maker
of
Samuel
Adams

00th
century
to
present
Economic
recovery
in
the
early
00th
century
was
brought
about
by
the
silk
and
textile
industry
.

The
Adelaide
Silk
Mill
,
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
at
the
time
,
opened
in
Allentown
in
0000
.

By
0000
,
there
were
more
than
000
silk
and
textile
mills
in
the
Lehigh
Valley
,
making
it
the
second
largest
industry
in
the
region
.

By
the
0000s
,
the
silk
industry
was
in
worldwide
decline
,
as
synthetics
were
taking
the
place
of
silk
.

Catoir
Silk
Mill
,
the
last
silk
mill
in
Allentown
,
closed
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
Mack
Trucks
moved
to
Allentown
,
beginning
Allentown
's
focus
on
heavy
industrial
manufacturing
.

Today
,
Allentown
's
economy
,
like
most
of
Pennsylvania
's
,
is
based
in
the
service
industries
with
some
manufacturing
.

Deindustrialization
has
caused
many
of
the
factories
and
corporations
headquartered
in
Allentown
to
close
or
move
.

For
example
,
Mack
Trucks
is
now
located
in
Greensboro
,
North
Carolina
,
LSI
Corporation
(
formerly
Agere
Systems
,
which
merged
with
LSI
Logic
)
moved
its
headquarters
to
California
,
and
numerous
factories
have
ceased
operation
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
Allentown
Economic
Development
(
AEDC
)
operates
a
business
incubator
,
the
Bridgeworks
,
which
helps
attract
and
support
young
commercial
and
manufacturing
businesses
.

Central
Business
District
Redevelopment
Plans
for
a
major
redevelopment
of
the
Central
Business
District
of
Allentown
were
announced
in
late
0000
as
a
result
of
Neighborhood
Improvement
Zone
(
NIZ
)
legislation
passed
by
the
Pennsylvania
legislature
.

Focused
on
the
0th
and
Hamilton
Streets
area
,
a
0-acre
one
square
block
was
acquired
by
Eminent
domain
during
0000
in
which
several
new
structures
are
planned
to
be
erected
:
The
project
has
generated
considerable
concern
centered
on
the
huge
cost
of
the
endeavor
from
funding
a
plan
with
no
cap
.

The
estimated
cost
of
the
project
is
currently
at
$
000
million
.

As
of
October
0000
,
$
000.0
million
in
bonds
have
been
sold
.

In
addition
to
the
funding
issues
,
there
has
been
debate
about
the
economic
feasibility
of
the
project
,
which
is
in
an
urban
,
high
crime
area
that
has
limited
parking
available
as
well
as
the
limited
seating
capacity
of
the
arena
.

Also
,
concerns
have
arisen
that
the
project
may
not
generate
enough
revenue
to
cover
the
cost
of
construction
,
which
has
more
than
doubled
from
its
initial
estimate
.

Existing
structures
were
demolished
in
early
0000
.

However
,
several
lawsuits
were
filed
due
to
the
nature
of
the
funding
of
the
project
.

The
lawsuits
were
settled
in
mid-0000
and
construction
is
now
underway
with
an
estimated
0000
completion
.

Health
Network
,
with
more
than
0,000
employees
.

In
0000
,
after
more
than
000
years
in
the
city
,
Mack
Trucks
announced
that
their
Allentown-based
corporate
headquarters
would
be
relocated
to
Greensboro
,
North
Carolina
in
0000
,
though
Mack
continues
to
operate
its
primary
manufacturing
facility
in
neighboring
Lower
Macungie
Township
.

It
was
expected
that
the
move
would
result
in
the
loss
of
approximately
000
jobs
.

Shopping
The
Center
City
area
along
Hamilton
Street
between
0th
and
00th
Streets
was
the
primary
shopping
district
in
Allentown
until
the
mid-0000s
.

The
"
Downtown
"
,
as
it
was
referred
to
,
was
anchored
by
Hess
's
(
0th
and
Hamilton
)
;
H.
Leh
and
Company
(
0th
and
Hamilton
)
,
and
Zollinger
and
Harned
(
0th
and
Hamilton
)
department
stores
.

Along
Hamilton
street
were
scores
of
retail
businesses
;
large
banks
;
movie
theaters
and
various
small
restaurants
and
lunch
counters
.

On
the
second
and
third
stories
,
professional
offices
could
be
found
in
many
of
the
smaller
buildings
with
storefronts
on
the
first
floor
.

Alfred
L.
Reichenbach
,
Mayor
of
Allentown
in
the
late
0000s
,
traveled
to
Europe
and
saw
beautiful
hanging
gardens
and
floral
lamp
posts
in
Paris
and
in
some
cities
in
Germany
.

He
was
also
an
amateur
horticulturist
and
enjoyed
all
varieties
of
flowers
and
anyone
visiting
the
mayor
's
office
during
his
tenure
would
find
vases
of
flowers
for
all
seasons
on
his
desk
and
tables
.

In
fact
,
it
was
he
who
had
floral
boxes
planted
outside
the
mayor
's
window
so
he
,
and
his
fellow
citizens
,
could
enjoy
seasonal
floral
designs
.

He
believed
that
it
would
be
a
good
way
to
beautify
the
downtown
shopping
district
and
encouraged
the
City
Council
with
idea
of
purchasing
the
floral
lamp
posts
during
the
renovations
of
Hamilton
Street
in
0000
.

Businesses
generally
operated
from
0am
to
0pm
Monday-Saturday
,
staying
open
until
0pm
on
Thursdays
and
starting
in
the
mid-0000s
,
also
on
Monday
nights
.

Until
0000
,
Lehigh
Valley
Transit
street
trolleys
operated
east-west
along
the
length
of
Hamilton
Street
,
and
also
north
and
south
along
0th
Street
.

The
major
transit
station
downtown
being
at
0th
&
Hamilton
.

In
the
0000s
,
a
privately
owned
parking
lot
system
(
Park
&
Shop
)
to
accommodate
shoppers
and
downtown
workers
began
to
be
built
by
razing
old
buildings
generally
within
a
block
of
Hamilton
between
Walnut
and
Linden
streets
,
with
Hamilton
Street
merchants
providing
validation
for
shoppers
parking
tickets
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
Hess
's
and
Leh
's
built
large
,
private
multilevel
covered
parking
decks
connected
to
their
department
stores
to
attract
customers
.

In
0000
,
the
Whitehall
Mall
opened
along
MacArthur
Road
,
just
north
of
Allentown
in
Whitehall
Township
.

It
was
the
first
enclosed
shopping
center
north
of
Philadelphia
when
it
opened
.

Having
two
major
department
stores
(
Sears
&
Roebuck
and
Zollinger
and
Harned
)
as
anchor
stores
when
it
opened
,
its
popularity
led
to
the
rise
of
a
sprawling
retail
district
along
MacArthur
Road
that
continued
to
expand
into
the
early
0000s
.

After
a
major
renovation
in
0000
,
the
Whitehall
Mall
's
anchors
included
Bed
,
Bath
&
Beyond
,
Kohl
's
,
and
Sears
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
Hess
's
South
,
a
satellite
location
of
the
Hess
's
downtown
store
,
expanded
to
become
the
South
Mall
,
located
in
South
Allentown
,
at
the
city
's
border
with
Salisbury
Township
and
Emmaus
.

Today
,
the
South
Mall
's
anchors
include
Gold
's
Gym
,
Petco
,
Staples
,
Stein
Mart
,
and
The
Bon-Ton
.

In
0000
,
the
Lehigh
Valley
Mall
opened
,
just
south
of
the
Whitehall
Mall
,
at
the
intersection
of
U.S.
Route
00
and
MacArthur
Road
.

With
more
than
000
stores
,
the
Lehigh
Valley
Mall
became
the
largest
shopping
mall
in
the
region
,
and
presently
has
anchors
including
Boscov
's
,
JCPenney
and
Macy
's
.

A
large
outdoor
shopping
addition
opened
in
October
0000
,
and
includes
stores
such
as
Apple
and
Barnes
&
Noble
.

Most
recently
,
The
Promenade
Shops
at
Saucon
Valley
,
a
large
,
upscale
outdoor
shopping
mall
,
opened
just
south
of
the
city
,
near
Pennsylvania
Route
000
and
Interstate
00
,
in
Upper
Saucon
Township
.

Hamilton
Mall
By
the
late
0000s
,
the
development
of
suburban
strip
shopping
centers
(
Lehigh
,
Crest
Plaza
,
Two
Guys
,
Mountainville
,
and
Parkway
)
in
the
area
during
the
late
0000s
and
0000s
and
especially
the
opening
of
the
indoor
Whitehall
Mall
in
0000
were
steadily
reducing
the
number
of
shoppers
along
Hamilton
Street
.

Consumers
preferred
the
convenience
of
easy
access
via
automobile
,
and
the
enclosed
Whitehall
Mall
to
the
pedestrian
outdoor
sidewalk
shopping
which
was
found
along
Hamilton
Street
.

The
City
of
Allentown
hired
the
firm
of
David
M.
Walker
Associates
in
0000
to
explore
the
needs
of
Center
City
.

The
0000
Walker
Report
concluded
that
automobile
traffic
had
taken
over
the
downtown
shopping
area
and
that
a
traffic-free
business
district
between
Linden
,
Walnut
,
Sixth
and
Tenth
Streets
be
developed
and
to
convert
the
downtown
Hamilton
Street
shopping
area
to
a
"
Semimall
"
,
later
known
as
"
Hamilton
Mall
"
.

Traffic
would
no
longer
be
allowed
on
Hamilton
Street
.

The
intersection
of
Eighth
and
Hamilton
would
be
closed
as
well
as
all
half
streets
intersecting
Hamilton
.

This
would
create
a
large
pedestrian
shopping
"
superblock
"
between
Center
Square
and
0th
Street
,
with
two
smaller
shopping
blocks
between
Sixth
and
Seventh
and
Ninth
and
Tenth
.

Center
Square
would
become
a
large
,
pedestrian
only
area
with
Seventh
street
being
reduced
to
one
lane
on
each
side
of
the
Soldier
's
and
Sailor
's
Monument
.

Hamilton
Street
would
be
completely
rebuilt
,
with
the
existing
street
removed
and
replaced
by
a
raised
brick
walking
surface
.

Large
,
enclosing
canopies
would
be
built
on
each
side
of
the
street
to
provide
shoppers
protection
from
the
weather
,
and
small
buses
would
operate
east-west
between
0th
and
00th
Streets
picking
up
and
dropping
off
shoppers
to
give
them
easy
access
to
retail
stores
.

During
a
00-day
test
in
April
0000
,
traffic
on
Hamilton
Street
was
shut
down
between
Sixth
and
Tenth
and
Lehigh
Valley
Transit
provided
small
buses
,
free
of
charge
for
shoppers
.

Walnut
Street
,
which
traditionally
ran
one
way
east
to
west
,
was
reversed
to
run
west-east
,
with
traffic
along
Hamilton
Street
being
diverted
south
to
Walnut
at
Twelfth
street
for
eastbound
travel
.

Traffic
moving
westbound
on
Hamilton
Street
was
diverted
north
at
Sixth
,
then
moved
west
along
Linden
to
Twelfth
,
then
south
to
Hamilton
,
giving
the
center
city
a
circular
traffic
flow
around
the
pedestrian-only
Center
City
.

It
was
difficult
for
small
merchants
downtown
to
receive
deliveries
,
since
the
half
streets
were
blocked
and
the
narrow
streets
did
not
allow
turnarounds
of
small
delivery
trucks
.

Also
,
the
new
restriction
prohibiting
automobile
traffic
on
Hamilton
Street
was
unpopular
,
and
the
proposed
closing
of
the
Eighth
and
Hamilton
intersection
was
deemed
impractical
,
since
it
blocked
a
major
north-south
route
from
South
Allentown
.

Within
a
week
,
Eighth
Street
was
reopened
.

The
plan
was
also
changed
to
allow
limited
two-lane
automobile
traffic
on
Hamilton
Street
one-way
west
to
east
,
with
limited
drop-off
and
pick-up
only
parking
.

Traffic
lights
were
installed
at
each
major
street
and
half
street
with
a
speed
limit
of
.

The
sidewalks
would
be
expanded
outwards
with
canopies
covering
them
.

Final
plans
were
developed
and
approval
was
given
by
City
Council
in
October
0000
.

Construction
of
Hamilton
Mall
began
in
early
0000
,
with
construction
lasting
until
0000
.

Starting
at
00th
street
and
proceeding
east
,
one
full
block
at
a
time
was
closed
to
traffic
with
the
existing
street
surface
and
sidewalks
removed
(
including
the
old
trolley
tracks
which
had
been
asphalted
over
in
the
0000s
)
along
with
the
sidewalks
on
each
side
of
the
street
.

In
addition
,
the
famous
downtown
sidewalk
street
lights
,
which
contained
hanging
flower
gardens
,
were
scrapped
.

Retail
store
street
signs
were
also
removed
,
including
the
large
signature
Hess
's
department
store
sign
because
they
interfered
with
the
sidewalk
street
canopies
.

The
large
parking
areas
at
Center
Square
and
comfort
station
under
the
square
were
also
removed
and
turned
into
large
brick
sidewalks
,
along
with
the
resurfacing
of
Seventh
Street
between
Linden
and
Walnut
Streets
.

The
construction
of
Hamilton
Mall
caused
severe
disruption
in
the
downtown
shopping
area
for
more
than
two
years
.

During
that
time
,
merchants
and
Center
City
employees
experienced
enormous
difficulties
as
sections
of
Hamilton
Street
were
closed
for
months
at
a
time
.

The
sidewalks
along
Hamilton
Street
were
reduced
to
single
path
walkways
,
and
piles
of
rubble
,
construction
material
,
the
sounds
of
heavy
construction
equipment
took
over
the
downtown
area
.

During
the
construction
period
shoppers
tended
to
avoid
the
downtown
area
and
shop
in
the
suburban
malls
and
shopping
centers
.

Officially
opened
in
0000
,
Hamilton
Mall
never
lived
up
to
the
expectations
of
the
city
planners
.

Large
numbers
of
shoppers
did
not
return
to
the
downtown
area
.

The
opening
of
Lehigh
Valley
Mall
in
0000
and
other
,
smaller
malls
in
the
suburbs
with
outside
satellite
stores
increased
the
number
of
businesses
closing
along
Hamilton
Street
.

The
major
expansion
of
MacArthur
Road
in
Whitehall
Township
also
led
to
fewer
and
fewer
shoppers
on
Hamilton
Mall
.

Improvements
were
made
along
Hamilton
Mall
by
removing
the
overhead
sidewalk
canopies
and
installing
a
new
generation
of
street
lights
,
designed
to
replicate
the
hanging
flower
gardens
of
the
ones
removed
in
the
construction
were
erected
to
improve
the
Mall
's
appearance
.

Parking
meters
were
installed
to
allow
longer
term
,
but
still
limited
parking
.

However
,
by
the
late
0000s
,
increased
suburbanization
led
to
a
general
decline
in
the
popularity
of
the
downtown
shopping
district
.

Retail
shopping
downtown
declined
with
the
closing
of
Leh
's
(
0000
)
and
Zollinger
's
(
0000
)
downtown
and
culminated
with
the
last
major
department
store
,
Hess
's
,
being
sold-off
in
0000
,
eventually
being
closed
and
subsequently
demolished
in
0000
.

Instead
of
a
shopping
Mecca
,
the
use
of
downtown
Allentown
has
turned
into
office
buildings
and
increasingly
has
become
a
center-city
campus
for
city
and
county
government
workers
,
along
with
those
of
PPL
.

History
Founding
Emmaus
was
settled
in
the
0000s
and
dates
its
founding
to
0000
.

For
approximately
000
years
,
until
the
mid-00th
century
,
it
was
a
closed
community
of
the
Moravian
Church
.

The
original
land
on
which
the
town
now
lies
was
donated
by
Sebastian
Heinrich
Knauss
and
Jacob
Ehrenhardt
for
use
by
the
Moravian
church
.

The
founders
and
original
residents
of
the
town
were
members
of
the
Lutheran
and
Reformed
faiths
,
who
joined
the
Moravian
church
when
their
own
denominations
were
unable
to
provide
ministers
.

Emmaus
was
one
of
the
four
leading
Moravian
communities
in
the
northeast
United
States
at
the
time
of
its
founding
;
Bethlehem
,
PA
,
Lititz
,
PA
and
Nazareth
,
PA
were
the
three
others
.

Origin
and
spelling
of
name
The
borough
was
named
for
the
biblical
village
of
Emmaus
(
now
within
modern
Israel
)
,
where
,
according
to
the
New
Testament
,
Jesus
was
seen
by
disciples
following
his
crucifixion
and
resurrection
.

From
its
founding
in
0000
until
0000
,
the
settlement
's
name
was
spelled
Emmaus
.

From
0000
until
0000
,
however
,
the
community
used
the
Pennsylvania
Dutch
spelling
of
the
name
,
Emaus
,
to
reflect
local
language
and
the
significant
presence
of
Pennsylvania
Dutch
.

In
0000
,
after
petitions
circulated
by
the
local
Rotary
Club
,
the
borough
formally
changed
the
name
's
spelling
back
to
Emmaus
,
reflecting
the
spelling
in
the
Gospel
of
Luke
in
the
English
New
Testament
.

00th
century
Iron
ore
was
discovered
nearby
in
the
00th
century
and
served
as
a
source
of
industrial
growth
for
much
of
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
.

In
0000
,
the
East
Pennsylvania
Railroad
(
later
part
of
the
Philadelphia
and
Reading
Railroad
)
brought
trains
to
Emmaus
.

That
same
year
,
the
town
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
.

In
0000
,
the
town
's
first
blast
furnace
opened
.

The
largest
iron
company
was
Donaldson
Iron
Company
,
which
made
cast
iron
pipes
and
other
products
until
the
company
closed
in
0000
.

During
the
00th
century
,
Emmaus
was
also
a
center
of
silk
and
cigar
manufacturing
.

Population
trends
In
0000
,
public
census
statistics
showed
that
0,000
people
lived
in
Emmaus
.

The
population
of
the
borough
has
since
nearly
doubled
to
00,000
,
as
of
the
0000
census
.

Housing
construction
has
reached
the
borough
line
in
all
directions
,
so
significant
continued
population
growth
in
the
borough
is
unlikely
.

Outside
the
borough
line
,
however
,
the
local
population
continues
to
grow
,
particularly
in
neighboring
Lower
Macungie
Township
.

The
Royal
Proclamation
of
0000
was
issued
October
0
,
0000
,
by
King
George
III
following
Great
Britain
's
acquisition
of
French
territory
in
North
America
after
the
end
of
the
French
and
Indian
War
/
Seven
Years
'
War
,
in
which
it
forbade
settlers
from
settling
past
a
line
drawn
along
the
Appalachian
Mountains
.

The
purpose
of
the
proclamation
was
to
organize
Great
Britain
's
new
North
American
empire
and
to
stabilize
relations
with
Native
North
Americans
through
regulation
of
trade
,
settlement
,
and
land
purchases
on
the
western
frontier
.

The
Royal
Proclamation
continues
to
be
of
legal
importance
to
First
Nations
in
Canada
and
is
significant
for
the
variation
of
indigenous
status
in
the
United
States
.

It
also
ensured
that
British
culture
and
laws
were
applied
in
Quebec
,
which
was
done
to
attract
British
settlers
to
Quebec
.

Background
The
Treaty
of
Paris
,
ending
Britain
's
participation
in
the
Seven
Years
'
War
,
had
seen
large
swaths
of
new
land
brought
under
British
Crown
control
,
as
France
had
ceded
all
North
America
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
,
including
Quebec
,
to
the
British
.

Provisions
New
colonies
Besides
regulating
colonial
expansion
,
the
proclamation
dealt
with
the
management
of
newly
ceded
French
colonies
.

It
established
government
for
four
areas
:
Quebec
,
West
Florida
,
East
Florida
,
and
Grenada
.

Native
lands
One
of
the
biggest
problems
confronting
the
British
Empire
in
0000
was
controlling
land
speculators
in
both
Europe
and
the
British
colonies
whose
activities
often
led
to
frontier
conflicts
.

Many
Native
American
peoples
—
primarily
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
—
had
a
long
and
close
relationship
with
France
,
and
were
dismayed
to
find
that
they
were
now
under
British
sovereignty
.

Pontiac
's
Rebellion
(
0000
–
00
)
was
an
unsuccessful
effort
by
Native
Americans
to
prevent
Great
Britain
from
occupying
the
land
previously
claimed
by
France
.

The
Proclamation
of
0000
had
been
in
the
works
before
Pontiac
's
Rebellion
,
but
the
outbreak
of
the
conflict
hastened
the
process
.

British
officials
hoped
the
proclamation
would
reconcile
Aboriginals
to
British
rule
and
thus
help
to
prevent
future
hostilities
.

The
proclamation
created
a
boundary
line
(
often
called
the
proclamation
line
)
between
the
British
colonies
on
the
Atlantic
coast
and
American
Indian
lands
(
called
the
Indian
Reserve
)
west
of
the
Appalachian
Mountains
.

The
proclamation
line
was
not
intended
to
be
a
permanent
boundary
between
white
and
Aboriginal
lands
,
but
rather
a
temporary
boundary
which
could
be
extended
further
west
in
an
orderly
,
lawful
manner
.

Its
contour
was
defined
by
the
headwaters
that
formed
the
watershed
along
the
Appalachia
—
all
land
with
rivers
that
flowed
into
the
Atlantic
was
designated
for
the
colonial
entities
while
all
the
land
with
rivers
that
flowed
into
the
Mississippi
was
reserved
for
the
native
Indian
population
.

The
proclamation
outlawed
private
purchase
of
Native
American
land
,
which
had
often
created
problems
in
the
past
;
instead
,
all
future
land
purchases
were
to
be
made
by
Crown
officials
"
at
some
public
Meeting
or
Assembly
of
the
said
Indians
"
.

Furthermore
,
British
colonists
were
forbidden
to
move
beyond
the
line
and
settle
on
native
lands
,
and
colonial
officials
were
forbidden
to
grant
grounds
or
lands
without
royal
approval
.

The
proclamation
gave
the
Crown
a
monopoly
on
all
future
land
purchases
from
American
Indians
.

Almost
immediately
,
many
British
colonists
and
land
speculators
objected
to
the
proclamation
boundary
,
since
there
were
already
many
settlements
beyond
the
line
(
some
of
which
had
been
temporarily
evacuated
during
Pontiac
's
War
)
,
as
well
as
many
existing
land
claims
yet
to
be
settled
.

Indeed
,
the
proclamation
itself
called
for
lands
to
be
granted
to
British
soldiers
that
had
served
in
the
Seven
Years
'
War
.

Prominent
American
colonists
joined
with
land
speculators
in
Britain
to
lobby
the
government
to
move
the
line
further
west
.

As
a
result
,
the
boundary
line
was
adjusted
in
a
series
of
treaties
with
Native
Americans
.

The
Treaty
of
Fort
Stanwix
and
the
Treaty
of
Hard
Labour
(
both
0000
)
and
the
Treaty
of
Lochaber
(
0000
)
opened
much
of
what
is
now
West
Virginia
and
Kentucky
to
British
settlement
.

Legacy
Canadian
Aboriginals
The
Royal
Proclamation
continued
to
govern
the
cession
of
aboriginal
land
in
British
North
America
,
especially
Upper
Canada
and
Rupert
's
Land
.

The
proclamation
forms
the
basis
of
land
claims
of
aboriginal
peoples
in
Canada
–
First
Nations
,
Inuit
,
and
Métis
.

The
Royal
Proclamation
of
0000
is
thus
mentioned
in
section
00
of
the
Canadian
Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms
.

According
to
historian
Colin
Calloway
,
"
scholars
disagree
on
whether
the
proclamation
recognized
or
undermined
tribal
sovereignty
"
.

The
language
of
the
proclamation
made
it
clear
that
the
British
still
believed
that
all
native
lands
ultimately
belonged
to
the
Crown
.

However
,
the
proclamation
established
the
important
precedent
that
the
indigenous
population
had
certain
rights
to
the
lands
they
occupied
—
in
the
past
,
by
contrast
,
the
Crown
had
granted
lands
without
regard
to
native
claims
.

Some
see
the
Royal
Proclamation
of
0000
as
a
“
fundamental
document
”
for
First
Nations
land
claims
and
self-government
.

It
is
“
the
first
legal
recognition
by
the
British
Crown
of
Aboriginal
rights
.

”
The
intent
and
promises
made
to
the
native
in
the
Proclamation
have
been
argued
to
be
of
a
temporary
nature
,
only
meant
to
appease
the
Native
peoples
who
were
becoming
increasingly
resentful
of
“
settler
encroachments
on
their
lands
”
and
were
capable
of
becoming
a
serious
threat
to
British
colonial
settlement
.

While
advising
the
Board
of
Trade
on
August
00
,
0000
,
Sir
William
Johnson
expressed
that
The
Indians
all
know
we
can
not
be
a
Match
for
them
in
the
midst
of
an
extensive
woody
Country
...
from
whence
I
infer
that
if
we
are
determined
to
possess
Our
Posts
,
Trade
&
ca
securely
,
it
can
not
be
done
for
a
Century
by
any
other
means
than
that
of
purchasing
the
favour
of
the
numerous
Indian
inhabitants
.

With
the
proclamation
,
“
the
British
were
trying
to
convince
Native
people
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
the
colonists
,
while
at
the
same
time
trying
to
increase
political
and
economic
power
relative
to
First
Nations
and
other
European
powers
.

”
However
,
the
Royal
Proclamation
along
with
the
subsequent
Treaty
of
Niagara
,
provide
for
an
argument
that
“
discredits
the
claims
of
the
Crown
to
exercise
sovereignty
over
First
Nations
”
and
affirms
Aboriginal
“
powers
of
self-determination
in
,
among
other
things
,
allocating
lands
.

”
Further
so
,
the
Royal
Proclamation
outlined
a
policy
in
which
to
protect
and
extinguish
Aboriginal
rights
and
in
doing
so
,
recognized
these
rights
existed
.

United
States
The
influence
of
the
Royal
Proclamation
of
0000
on
the
coming
of
the
American
Revolution
has
been
variously
interpreted
.

Many
historians
argue
that
the
proclamation
ceased
to
be
a
major
source
of
tension
after
0000
,
since
the
aforementioned
treaties
opened
up
extensive
lands
for
settlement
.

Others
have
argued
that
colonial
resentment
of
the
proclamation
contributed
to
the
growing
divide
between
the
colonies
and
the
mother
country
.

Historian
Woody
Holton
,
for
example
,
argued
that
even
though
the
boundary
was
pushed
west
in
subsequent
treaties
,
the
British
government
refused
to
permit
new
colonial
settlements
for
fear
of
instigating
a
war
with
Native
Americans
,
which
angered
colonial
land
speculators
.

George
Washington
was
given
of
wild
land
in
the
Ohio
region
for
his
services
in
the
French
and
Indian
War
.

In
0000
,
Washington
took
the
lead
in
securing
the
rights
of
him
and
his
old
soldiers
in
the
French
War
,
advancing
money
to
pay
expenses
in
behalf
of
the
common
cause
and
using
his
influence
in
the
proper
quarters
.

In
August
0000
,
it
was
decided
that
Washington
should
personally
make
a
trip
to
the
western
region
,
where
he
located
tracts
for
himself
and
military
comrades
and
eventually
was
granted
letters
patent
for
tracts
of
land
there
.

The
lands
involved
were
open
to
Virginians
under
terms
of
the
Treaty
of
Lochaber
of
0000
,
except
for
the
lands
located
0
miles
south
of
Fort
Pitt
,
now
known
as
Pittsburgh
.

In
the
United
States
,
the
Royal
Proclamation
of
0000
ended
with
the
American
Revolutionary
War
because
Great
Britain
ceded
the
land
in
question
to
the
United
States
in
the
Treaty
of
Paris
(
0000
)
.

Afterward
,
the
U.S.
government
also
faced
difficulties
in
preventing
frontier
violence
and
eventually
adopted
policies
similar
to
those
of
the
Royal
Proclamation
.

The
first
in
a
series
of
Indian
Intercourse
Act
s
was
passed
in
0000
,
prohibiting
unregulated
trade
and
travel
in
Native
American
lands
.

In
0000
,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
case
Johnson
v.
M'Intosh
established
that
only
the
U.S.
government
,
and
not
private
individuals
,
could
purchase
land
from
Native
Americans
.

Fullerton
is
a
census-designated
place
(
CDP
)
in
Whitehall
Township
,
Lehigh
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

Fullerton
is
a
suburb
of
Allentown
,
in
the
Lehigh
Valley
region
of
the
state
.

The
population
of
Fullerton
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Originally
known
as
Ferndale
,
the
town
was
located
on
tracts
of
land
originally
settled
by
Giles
Windsor
(
0000
)
,
Stephen
Snyder
(
0000
)
and
Jacob
Yundt
(
0000
)
.

In
0000
,
the
town
was
renamed
"
Fullerton
"
in
honor
of
local
businessman
James
W.
Fuller
Jr.
,
who
had
purchased
the
railroad
car
wheel
factory
of
Frederick
&
Company
in
0000
and
operated
it
as
McKee
,
Fuller
&
Co.
.

and
later
the
Lehigh
Car
,
Wheel
&
Axle
Works
.

Fuller
laid
out
the
hamlet
in
0000
,
and
by
0000
it
was
a
thriving
company-town
with
a
population
in
excess
of
0,000
men
and
their
families
.

When
the
Lehigh
Valley
cement
industry
exploded
in
the
early
0000s
,
Fuller
's
company
prospered
by
providing
machinery
to
the
mills
in
the
region
,
and
the
town
supplied
the
workforce
for
both
his
factories
,
and
the
numerous
mills
and
quarries
operating
in
the
immediate
area
.

The

's
Rebellion
in
0000
,
the
U.S.
Marshal
began
arresting
people
for
tax
resistance
and
arrests
were
made
without
much
incident
until
the
marshal
reached
Millerstown
,
where
a
crowd
formed
to
protect
a
man
from
arrest
.

Failing
to
make
that
arrest
,
the
marshal
made
a
few
others
and
returned
to
Bethlehem
,
Pennsylvania
with
his
prisoners
.

Two
separate
groups
of
rebels
independently
vowed
to
liberate
the
prisoners
,

marched
on
Bethlehem
.

The
militia
prevailed
and
John
Fries
,
leader
of
the
rebellion
,
and
others
were
arrested
.

in

County
.

South
Whitehall
Township
is
a
township
in
Lehigh
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
United
States
.

It
is
a
suburb
of
Allentown
,
Pennsylvania
,
in
the
Lehigh
Valley
area
of
the
state
.

The
population
of
South
Whitehall
Township
was
00,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
home
to
the
Lehigh
Valley
interchange
of
the
Northeast
Extension
of
the
Pennsylvania
Turnpike
and
Dorney
Park
,
as
well
it
has
the
distinction
of
having
the
second
highest
tax
rate
of
any
township
in
Lehigh
County
.

History
The
first
settlers
of
the
Lehigh
Valley
region
were
Germans
who
emigrated
from
earlier
settlements
along
the
Perkiomen
Creek
.

The
earliest
settlers
arrived
in
the
region
over
a
00-year
period
beginning
in
about
0000
.

The
immigration
of
the
Germans
and
other
European
natives
,
including
Swiss
and
Huguenots
,
was
aided
by
William
Penn
and
his
friends
.

The
land
lying
south
of
the
South
Mountain
was
given
to
William
Penn
in
0000
by
the
Lenni
Lenape
Indians
.

The
land
of
Lehigh
County
lying
between
the
Blue
Mountain
and
the
Lehigh
Mountains
was
given
to
Penn
's
sons
by
the
Lenni
Lenapes
in
0000
.

Emigrants
sought
the
fertile
,
limestone
valley
flanking
rivers
and
streams
such
as
the
Jordan
Creek
.

One
of
the
earliest
tracts
of
land
purchased
in
the
Township
was
by
Nicholas
Kern
who
bought
tracts
of
land
on
December
0
,
0000
and
October
00
,
0000
.

Some
of
this
was
sold
to
Lorenz
Guth
on
February
00
,
0000
.

Guth
continued
to
buy
land
in
the
area
of
the
Reformed
church
property
and
also
in
the
Guthsville
area
.

By
0000
his
holdings
totaled
.

The
Lorenz
Guth
house
near
Wehr
's
Dam
still
stands
in
excellent
condition
and
is
a
fine
example
of
colonial
architecture
.

Much
of
the
history
of
South
Whitehall
can
be
traced
to
the
Walbert-Guthsville
region
,
and
especially
the
two
Jordan
churches
.

The
first
ministration
to
the
Lutheran
people
in
the
township
occurred
in
0000
when
Reverend
John
Casper
Stoever
baptized
Margaret
,
the
daughter
of
the
John
Lichtenwalners
,
on
February
0
.

In
0000
a
Reverend
Schmidt
preached
occasionally
to
the
Lutherans
,
and
in
0000
Reverend
John
Justus
Jacob
Birkenstock
became
pastor
of
the
Jordan
Lutheran
congregation
.

In
0000
it
was
noted
that
the
centennial
of
the
congregation
was
observed
,
which
would
indicate
that
the
first
building
was
erected
in
0000
.

The
first
church
building
was
of
logs
and
stood
near
the
north
wall
of
the
old
burial
ground
.

It
was
used
jointly
by
the
Lutheran
and
Reformed
congregations
until
about
0000
when
the
Reformed
erected
a
building
half
a
mile
to
the
east
,
within
sight
of
the
current
municipal
building
.

The
Lutherans
built
the
present
church
in
0000-0000
at
a
cost
of
$
0,000.00
.

It
was
renovated
in
0000
,
and
in
0000
a
fine
,
shapely
,
slate-covered
steeple
,
high
,
was
erected
.

Members
of
the
Reformed
(
United
Church
of
Christ
)
religion
settled
in
the
area
as
early
as
0000
,
and
baptisms
of
their
children
during
the
period
of
0000
to
0000
are
recorded
in
the
Lutheran
record
book
.

In
0000
Lorenz
Guth
presented
the
Reformed
with
a
tract
of
land
,
and
a
log
church
was
erected
in
six
weeks
.

The
second
and
present
church
building
,
with
its
steeple
was
built
in
0000
.

It
stands
as
one
of
the
oldest
church
buildings
in
the
country
,
and
is
a
fine
example
of
the
architecture
of
that
period
.

The
early
schools
of
the
township
were
connected
with
the
two
Jordan
churches
for
many
years
,
possibly
extending
back
to
0000
.

According
to
the
Roberts
history
,
the
congregations
were
at
first
supplied
not
by
pastors
,
but
by
teachers
who
used
to
read
sermons
on
Sundays
.

Thus
,
it
is
possible
that
church-sponsored
schools
taught
by
the
readers
existed
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
congregations
.

The
original
name
"
Whitehall
"
dates
to
0000
and
encompasses
the
land
now
found
in
North
Whitehall
,
South
Whitehall
,
and
Whitehall
Township
s.
Prior
to
the
establishment
of
Northampton
County
in
0000
,
the
area
was
part
of
Bucks
County
and
the
land
currently
occupied
by
South
Whitehall
was
known
as
"
the
back
part
of
Macungie
"
on
the
"
Heidelberg
District

The

Whitehall
is
thought
to
be
derived
from
one
of
two
sources
:
either
a
place
in
England
,
or
for
a
white
house
erected
as
a
hunting
lodge
near
the
Jordan
and
Cedar
Creeks
.

South
Whitehall
Township
was
established
in
0000
by
a
petition
to
the
Northampton
County
Court
to
divide
former
Whitehall
Township
into
two
areas
,
North
Whitehall
and
South
Whitehall
Townships
.

In
0000
,
Lehigh
County
was
divided
off
from
the
original
Northampton
County
,
establishing
South
Whitehall
Township
within
and
nearly
at
the
center
of
Lehigh
County
.

At
that
time
,
according
to
historians
,
"
...
many
prominent
and
influential
men
who
lived
in
the
vicinity
of
Guthsville
exerted
themselves
to
secure
the
selection
of
the
village
as
the
place
best
adapted
for
the
county
seat
on
account
of
its
situation
in
the
geographical
center
of
the
large
area
of
territory
to
be
erected
into
a
separate
county
,
but
their
efforts
proved
unavailing
and
the
advocates
of
Allentown
were
successful
.

Agriculture
was
the
backbone
of
the
economy
of
the
township
for
many
years
.

Much
of
the
land
today
still
is
under
cultivation
.

For
more
than
a
century
at
least
six
grain
mills
flourished
on
the
Jordan
and
Cedar
Creek
s.
In
the
early
00th
century
iron
ore
was
discovered
at
different
places
in
the
township
and
mining
operations
were
carried
on
from
0000
to
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
eastern
portion
of
South
Whitehall
and
the
southeastern
portion
of
North
Whitehall
were
detached
and
formed
into
Whitehall
Township
.

In
0000
,
South
Whitehall
became
a
First
Class
Township
.

The
Dorneyville
Crossroad
Settlement
,
Haines
Mill

will
gain
.

So
to
gain
more
land
,
the
Europeans
had
paid
a
professional
runner
to
run
for
them
.

The
runner
that
had
run
for
them
had
got
as

as
what

Jim

Geography
According
to
the

States
Census
Bureau
,
the
township
has
a
total
area
of
00.0
square
miles
(
00.0
km
²
)
,
of
which
,
00.0
square
miles
(
00.0
km
²
)
of
it
is
land
and
0.0
square
miles
(
0.0

)
of
it
(
0.00

)
is
water
.

The
township
was
originally
created
on
March
00
,
0000
and
included
what
is
now
North
Whitehall
and
South
Whitehall
Townships
.

In
0000
,
a
petition
was
made
to
the
Northampton
County
Court
to
split
the
township
into
two
portions
(
at
the
time
,
the
area
now
encompassed
by
Lehigh
County
was
part
of
Northampton
County
)
.

The
name
Whitehall
refers
to
a
white
hall
that
was
built
along
the
Jordan
in
the
early
0000s
as
a
hunting
lodge
.

The
area
had
a
large
ruffed
grouse
population
along
with
numerous
white-tail
deer
,
eastern
elk
,
eastern
wolves
,
and
black
bear
.

Mountain
lions
or
cougars
may
have
also
existed
within
Whitehall
Township
at
some
point
in
time
.

Because
of
the
rich
biodiversity
of
the
area
it
became
known
as
the
wilderness
of
Whitehall
.

Old

forest
consisting
of
oak
,

black
walnut
,
sugar
maple
,
basswood
,
American
chestnut
,
American
beech
,
and
sycamore
covered
the
entire
township
.

In
0000
eastern
portions
of
both
North
and
South
Whitehall
were
reapportioned
into
the
current
Whitehall
Township
.

The
new
Whitehall
Township
is
generally
rectangular
in
shape
,
running
from
NNW
to
SSE
and
is
situated
along
the
western
bank
of
the
Lehigh
River
.

Two
years
after
the
new
township
's
formation
,
the
Borough
of
Coplay
was
incorporated
,
removing
from
the
township
a
square
section
of
0.0
square
miles
(
0.0
km0
)
.

Whitehall
is
drained
by
the
Lehigh
River
,
which
separates
it
from
Northampton
County
and
Catasauqua
.

Its
villages
include
Cementon
,

The
township
's
main
north-to-south

,
which
has
an

in
the
south
and
crosses

Lamb
:
The
Gospel
According
to
Biff
,
Christ
's
Childhood
Pal
is
the
sixth
novel
by
absurdist
author
Christopher
Moore
,
published
in
0000
.

In
this
work
the
author
seeks
to
fill
in
the
"
lost
"
years
of
Jesus
through
the
point
of
view
of
Jesus
'
childhood
pal
,
"
Levi
bar
Alphaeus
who
is
called
Biff
"
.

The
original
edition
of
Lamb
was
issued
in
hardback
and
paperback
and
contains
an
afterword
by
the
author
explaining
some
of
the
background
of
the
novel
.

In
0000
a
special
gift
edition
was
published
,
with
a
second
afterword
by
Moore
,
recollecting
his
trip
to
Israel
for
research
.

According
to
the
author
,
the
producer-director
Peter
Douglas
(
with
Vincent
Pictures
)
has
purchased
the
film
rights
to
the
novel
.

Plot
summary
Biff
has
been
resurrected
in
the
present
day
to
complete
missing
parts
of
the
Bible
,
supposedly
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
angel
Raziel
,
who
turns
out
to
be
more
interested
in
soap
operas
and
Spider-man
on
the
television
in
their
hotel
.

Biff
is
made
to
write
down
his
account
of
the
decades
missing
from
Jesus
'
life
.

During
these
years
he
and
Joshua
(
which
,
as
Biff
points
out
,
is
the
original
Hebrew
version
of
the
Hellenized
"
Jesus
"
,
and
thus
in
Galilee
Jesus
was
called
Joshua
Bar
Joseph
)
travel
to
the
East
to
seek
the
Three
Wise
Men
(
a
magician
,
a
Buddhist
,
and
a
Hindu
Yogi
)
who
attended
Joshua
's
birth
so
that
he
may
learn
how
to
become
the
Messiah
.

Over
a
span
of
roughly
twenty
years
,
Joshua
learns
a
great
deal
about
human
nature
,
world
religions
,
and
how
he
is
able
to
translate
those
into
his
teachings
.

At
each
point
,
Joshua
surpasses
the
abilities
of
the
wise
men
by
incorporating
his
own
beliefs
into
theirs
.

The
story
takes
a
fantastical
twist
on
Joshua
's
miracles
as
well
:
he
learns
to
multiply
food
from
one
of
the
Wise
Men
and
learns
to
become
invisible
from
another
;
however
,
his
ability
to
resurrect
the
dead
figures
strongly
into
his
first
meeting
with
Biff
when
both
boys
are
six
years
old
.

Biff
,
for
himself
,
is
sarcastic
,
practical
and
endlessly
loyal
.

While
it
would
seem
that
such
traits
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
he
was
the
Messiah
's
best
friend
for
nearly
thirty
years
,
would
ensure
his
place
in
the
Gospels
,
there
are
reasons
,
as
revealed
in
the
final
chapter
,
why
Biff
was
essentially
"
cut
out
"
of
the
story
.

The
recounting
of
Jesus
'
human
and
godlike
qualities
,
combined
with
Biff
's
earthy
debauchery
,
leads
to
its
all-too-familiar
tragic
ending
,
but
humorously
explains
many
things
:
the
origins
of
judo
(
a
pun
that
is
definitely
intended
)
,
why
Jews
eat
Chinese
food
on
Christmas
,
and
how
rabbits
became
associated
with
Easter
.

The
Three
Wise
Men
,
Mary
Magdalene
(
on
whom
Biff
has
a
childhood
crush
)
,
Joseph
,
and
Mary
(
Joshua
's
mother
,
whom
Biff
plans
to
marry
if
anything
happens
to
Joseph
)
all
have
their
part
in
the
life
and
times
of
Joshua
.

Mary
Magdalene
is
depicted
as
harboring
love
for
Joshua
,
though
in
Moore
's
version
Joshua
remains
chaste
,
as
per
Raziel
's
instructions
.

This
in
itself
leads
to
some
of
Biff
's
debauchery
,
as
he
is
literally
attempting
to
go
through
enough
harlots
for
both
of
them
.

Biff
himself
loves
"
Maggie
"
with
the
same
intensity
,
leading
to
a
revolving
love
triangle
.

At
the
conclusion
of
the
novel
,
Biff
completes
"
The
Gospel
According
to
Biff
"
,
giving
it
to
Raziel
,
who
allows
Biff
to
finally
leave
the
hotel
room
.

As
Biff
exits
into
the
hallway
he
is
surprised
to
find
a
resurrected
Maggie
exiting
the
room
opposite
,
having
finished
her
own
Gospel
weeks
ago
.

The
two
embrace
,
informed
by
an
angel
that
it
is
"
the
will
of
the
Son
"
that
they
be
together
.

The
two
leave
together
,
Biff
overjoyed
to
be
given
a
second
chance
with
Maggie
.

Literary
allusions
The
author
has
cited
Bulgakov
's
novel
The
Master
and
Margarita
—
particularly
its
Biblical
scenes
told
from
Pontius
Pilate
's
point
of
view
—
as
a
partial
inspiration
to
create
this
novel
.

The
second
law
of
thermodynamics
states
that
the
entropy
of
an
isolated
system
never
decreases
,
because
isolated
systems
spontaneously
evolve
towards
thermodynamic
equilibrium
—
the
state
of
maximum
entropy
.

Equivalently
,
perpetual
motion
machines
of
the
second
kind
are
impossible
.

The
second
law
is
an
empirically
validated
postulate
of
thermodynamics
,
but
it
can
be
understood
and
explained
using
the
underlying
quantum
statistical
mechanics
,
together
with
the
assumption
of
low-entropy
initial
conditions
in
the
distant
past
(
possibly
at
the
beginning
of
the
universe
)
.

In
the
language
of
statistical
mechanics
,
entropy
is
a
measure
of
the
number
of
microscopic
configurations
corresponding
to
a
macroscopic
state
.

Because
equilibrium
corresponds
to
a
vastly
greater
number
of
microscopic
configurations
than
any
non-equilibrium
state
,
it
has
the
maximum
entropy
,
and
the
second
law
follows
because
random
chance
alone
practically
guarantees
that
the
system
will
evolve
towards
equilibrium
.

The
second
law
is
thought
to
be
the
source
of
the
direction
of
time
.

It
is
an
expression
of
the
fact
that
over
time
,
differences
in
temperature
,
pressure
,
and
chemical
potential
decrease
in
an
isolated
non-gravitational
physical
system
,
leading
eventually
to
a
state
of
thermodynamic
equilibrium
.

The
second
law
may
be
expressed
in
many
specific
ways
,
but
the
first
formulation
is
credited
to
the
French
scientist
Sadi
Carnot
in
0000
(
see
Timeline
of
thermodynamics
)
.

The
second
law
has
been
shown
to
be
equivalent
to
the
internal
energy
U
being
a
weakly
convex
function
,
when
written
as
a
function
of
extensive
properties
(
mass
,
volume
,
entropy
,
...
)
.

Description
The
first
law
of
thermodynamics
provides
the
basic
definition
of
thermodynamic
energy
,
also
called
internal
energy
,
associated
with
all
thermodynamic
system
s
,
but
unknown
in
classical
mechanics
,
and
states
the
rule
of
conservation
of
energy
in
nature
.

However
,
the
concept
of
energy
in
the
first
law
does
not
account
for
the
observation
that
natural
processes
have
a
preferred
direction
of
progress
.

For
example
,
heat
always
flows
spontaneously
from
regions
of
higher
temperature
to
regions
of
lower
temperature
,
and
never
the
reverse
,
unless
external
work
is
performed
on
the
system
.

The
first
law
is
completely
symmetrical
with
respect
to
the
initial
and
final
states
of
an
evolving
system
.

The
key
concept
for
the
explanation
of
this
phenomenon
through
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
is
the
definition
of
a
new
physical
property
,
the
entropy
.

A
change
in
the
entropy
(
)
of
a
system
is
the
infinitesimal
transfer
of
heat
(
)
to
a
closed
system
driving
a
reversible
process
,
divided
by
the
equilibrium
temperature
(
)
of
the
system
.

The
entropy
of
an
isolated
system
that
is
in
equilibrium
is
constant
and
has
reached
its
maximum
value
.

For
a
body
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
another
,
there
are
indefinitely
many
empirical
temperature
scales
,
in
general
respectively
depending
on
the
properties
of
a
particular
reference
thermometric
body
.

Thermal
equilibrium
between
two
bodies
entails
that
they
have
equal
temperatures
.

The
zeroth
law
of
thermodynamics
in
its
usual
short
statement
allows
recognition
that
two
bodies
have
the
same
temperature
,
especially
that
a
test
body
has
the
same
temperature
as
a
reference
thermometric
body
.

The
second
law
allows
a
distinguished
temperature
scale
,
which
defines
an
absolute
,
thermodynamic
temperature
,
independent
of
the
properties
of
any
particular
thermometric
body
.

The
second
law
of
thermodynamics
may
be
expressed
in
many
specific
ways
,
the
most
prominent
classical
statements
being
the
statement
by
Rudolph
Clausius
(
0000
)
,
the
statement
by
Lord
Kelvin
(
0000
)
,
and
the
statement
in
axiomatic
thermodynamics
by
Constantin
Carathéodory
(
0000
)
.

These
statements
cast
the
law
in
general
physical
terms
citing
the
impossibility
of
certain
processes
.

The
Clausius
and
the
Kelvin
statements
have
been
shown
to
be
equivalent
.

A
more
recent
statement
,
due
to
George
N.
Hatsopoulos
and
Joseph
H.
Keenan
,
is
:
Among
all
the
states
of
a
system
with
given
energy
,
constituents
and
parameters
,
there
exists
a
unique
stable
equilibrium
that
can
always
be
reached
from
any
other
state
(
with
the
same
energy
,
constituents
and
parameters
)
by
a
reversible
weight
process
.

The
Kelvin-Planck
,
Clausius
and
Cathedory
statements
can
all
be
shown
to
follow
from
the
Hatsopoulos-Keenan
statement
.

Clausius
statement
The
German
scientist
Rudolf
Clausius
laid
the
foundation
for
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
in
0000
by
examining
the
relation
between
heat
transfer
and
work
.

His
formulation
of
the
second
law
,
which
was
published
in
German
in
0000
,
is
known
as
the
Clausius
statement
:
Heat
can
never
pass
from
a
colder
to
a
warmer
body
without
some
other
change
,
connected
therewith
,
occurring
at
the
same
time
.

Heat
can
not
spontaneously
flow
from
cold
regions
to
hot
regions
without
external
work
being
performed
on
the
system
,
which
is
evident
from
ordinary
experience
of
refrigeration
,
for
example
.

In
a
refrigerator
,
heat
flows
from
cold
to
hot
,
but
only
when
forced
by
an
external
agent
,
the
refrigeration
system
.

Kelvin
statement
Lord
Kelvin
expressed
the
second
law
asIt
is
impossible
,
by
means
of
inanimate
material
agency
,
to
derive
mechanical
effect
from
any
portion
of
matter
by
cooling
it
below
the
temperature
of
the
coldest
of
the
surrounding
objects
.

Principle
of
Carathéodory
Constantin
Carathéodory
formulated
thermodynamics
on
a
purely
mathematical
axiomatic
foundation
.

His
statement
of
the
second
law
is
known
as
the
Principle
of
Carathéodory
,
which
may
be
formulated
as
follows
:
In
every
neighborhood
of
any
state
S
of
an
adiabatically
isolated
system
there
are
states
inaccessible
from
S.
With
this
formulation
he
described
the
concept
of
adiabatic
accessibility
for
the
first
time
and
provided
the
foundation
for
a
new
subfield
of
classical
thermodynamics
,
often
called
geometrical
thermodynamics
.

It
follows
from
Carathéodory
's
principle
that
quantity
of
energy
quasi-statically
transferred
as
heat
is
a
holonomic
process
function
,
in
other
words
,
\
delta
Q
=
TdS
.

Though
it
is
almost
customary
in
textbooks
to
say
that
Carathéodory
's
principle
expresses
the
second
law
and
to
treat
it
as
equivalent
to
the
Clausius
or
to
the
Kelvin-Planck
statements
,
such
is
not
the
case
.

To
get
all
the
content
of
the
second
law
,
Carathéodory
's
principle
needs
to
be
supplemented
by
Planck
's
principle
,
that
isochoric
work
always
increases
the
internal
energy
of
a
closed
system
that
was
initially
in
its
own
internal
thermodynamic
equilibrium
.

Equivalence
of
the
statements
Suppose
there
is
an
engine
violating
the
Kelvin
statement
:
i.e.
,
one
that
drains
heat
and
converts
it
completely
into
work
in
a
cyclic
fashion
without
any
other
result
.

Now
pair
it
with
a
reversed
Carnot
engine
as
shown
by
the
graph
.

The
net
and
sole
effect
of
this
newly
created
engine
consisting
of
the
two
engines
mentioned
is
transferring
heat
\
Delta
Q
=
Q
\
left
(
\
frac
-0
\
right
)
from
the
cooler
reservoir
to
the
hotter
one
,
which
violates
the
Clausius
statement
.

Thus
a
violation
of
the
Kelvin
statement
implies
a
violation
of
the
Clausius
statement
,
i.e.
the
Clausius
statement
implies
the
Kelvin
statement
.

We
can
prove
in
a
similar
manner
that
the
Kelvin
statement
implies
the
Clausius
statement
,
and
hence
the
two
are
equivalent
.

Gravitational
systems
In
non-gravitational
systems
objects
always
have
positive
heat
capacity
,
meaning
that
the
temperature
rises
with
energy
.

Therefore
,
when
energy
flows
from
a
high-temperature
object
to
a
low-temperature
object
,
the
source
temperature
is
decreased
while
the
sink
temperature
is
increased
;
hence
temperature
differences
tend
to
diminish
over
time
.

However
,
this
is
not
always
the
case
for
systems
in
which
the
gravitational
force
is
important
.

The
most
striking
examples
are
black
holes
,
which
-
according
to
theory
-
have
negative
heat
capacity
.

The
larger
the
black
hole
,
the
more
energy
it
contains
,
but
the
lower
its
temperature
.

Thus
,
the
supermassive
black
hole
in
the
center
of
the
milky
way
is
supposed
to
have
a
temperature
of
00
−
00
K
,
much
lower
than
the
cosmic
microwave
background
temperature
of
0.0
K
,
but
as
it
absorbs
photons
of
the
cosmic
microwave
background
its
mass
is
increasing
so
that
its
low
temperature
further
decreases
with
time
.

For
this
reason
,
gravitational
systems
tend
towards
non-even
distribution
of
mass
and
energy
.

Corollaries
Perpetual
motion
of
the
second
kind
Before
the
establishment
of
the
Second
Law
,
many
people
who
were
interested
in
inventing
a
perpetual
motion
machine
had
tried
to
circumvent
the
restrictions
of
First
Law
of
Thermodynamics
by
extracting
the
massive
internal
energy
of
the
environment
as
the
power
of
the
machine
.

Such
a
machine
is
called
a
"
perpetual
motion
machine
of
the
second
kind
"
.

The
second
law
declared
the
impossibility
of
such
machines
.

Carnot
theorem
Carnot
's
theorem
(
0000
)
is
a
principle
that
limits
the
maximum
efficiency
for
any
possible
engine
.

The
efficiency
solely
depends
on
the
temperature
difference
between
the
hot
and
cold
thermal
reservoirs
.

Carnot
's
theorem
states
:
In
his
ideal
model
,
the
heat
of
caloric
converted
into
work
could
be
reinstated
by
reversing
the
motion
of
the
cycle
,
a
concept
subsequently
known
as
thermodynamic
reversibility
.

Carnot
however
further
postulated
that
some
caloric
is
lost
,
not
being
converted
to
mechanical
work
.

Hence
no
real
heat
engine
could
realise
the
Carnot
cycle
's
reversibility
and
was
condemned
to
be
less
efficient
.

Though
formulated
in
terms
of
caloric
(
see
the
obsolete
caloric
theory
)
,
rather
than
entropy
,
this
was
an
early
insight
into
the
second
law
.

Clausius
Inequality
The
Clausius
Theorem
(
0000
)
states
that
in
a
cyclic
process
The
equality
holds
in
the
reversible
case
and
the
'
-
sign
holds
.

An
alternative
way
of
formulating
of
the
second
law
for
isolated
systems
is
:
with
\
dot
S
_
the
sum
of
the
rate
of
entropy
production
by
all
processes
inside
the
system
.

The
advantage
of
this
formulation
is
that
it
shows
the
effect
of
the
entropy
production
.

The
rate
of
entropy
production
is
a
very
important
concept
since
it
determines
(
limits
)
the
efficiency
of
thermal
machines
.

Multiplied
with
ambient
temperature
T
_
it
gives
the
so-called
dissipated
energy
P
_
=
T
_
\
dot
S
_
.

The
expression
of
the
second
law
for
closed
systems
(
so
,
allowing
heat
exchange
and
moving
boundaries
,
but
not
exchange
of
matter
)
is
:
Here
If
heat
is
supplied
to
the
system
at
several
places
we
have
to
take
the
algebraic
sum
of
the
corresponding
terms
.

For
open
systems
(
also
allowing
exchange
of
matter
)
:
Here
\
dot
S
is
the
flow
of
entropy
into
the
system
associated
with
the
flow
of
matter
entering
the
system
.

It
should
not
be
confused
with
the
time
derivative
of
the
entropy
.

If
matter
is
supplied
at
several
places
we
have
to
take
the
algebraic
sum
of
these
contributions
.

Statistical
mechanics
gives
an
explanation
for
the
second
law
by
postulating
that
a
material
is
composed
of
atoms
and
molecules
which
are
in
constant
motion
.

A
particular
set
of
positions
and
velocities
for
each
particle
in
the
system
is
called
a
microstate
of
the
system
and
because
of
the
constant
motion
,
the
system
is
constantly
changing
its
microstate
.

Statistical
mechanics
postulates
that
,
in
equilibrium
,
each
microstate
that
the
system
might
be
in
is
equally
likely
to
occur
,
and
when
this
assumption
is
made
,
it
leads
directly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
second
law
must
hold
in
a
statistical
sense
.

That
is
,
the
second
law
will
hold
on
average
,
with
a
statistical
variation
on
the
order
of
0
/
√
N
where
N
is
the
number
of
particles
in
the
system
.

For
everyday
(
macroscopic
)
situations
,
the
probability
that
the
second
law
will
be
violated
is
practically
zero
.

However
,
for
systems
with
a
small
number
of
particles
,
thermodynamic
parameters
,
including
the
entropy
,
may
show
significant
statistical
deviations
from
that
predicted
by
the
second
law
.

Classical
thermodynamic
theory
does
not
deal
with
these
statistical
variations
.

Derivation
from
statistical
mechanics
Due
to
Loschmidt
's
paradox
,
derivations
the
Second
Law
have
to
make
an
assumption
regarding
the
past
,
namely
that
the
system
is
uncorrelated
at
some
time
in
the
past
;
this
allows
for
simple
probabilistic
treatment
.

This
assumption
is
usually
thought
as
a
boundary
condition
,
and
thus
the
second
Law
is
ultimately
a
consequence
of
the
initial
conditions
somewhere
in
the
past
,
probably
at
the
beginning
of
the
universe
(
the
Big
Bang
)
,
though
other
scenarios
have
also
been
suggested
.

Given
these
assumptions
,
in
statistical
mechanics
,
the
Second
Law
is
not
a
postulate
,
rather
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
fundamental
postulate
,
also
known
as
the
equal
prior
probability
postulate
,
so
long
as
one
is
clear
that
simple
probability
arguments
are
applied
only
to
the
future
,
while
for
the
past
there
are
auxiliary
sources
of
information
which
tell
us
that
it
was
low
entropy
.

The
first
part
of
the
second
law
,
which
states
that
the
entropy
of
a
thermally
isolated
system
can
only
increase
is
a
trivial
consequence
of
the
equal
prior
probability
postulate
,
if
we
restrict
the
notion
of
the
entropy
to
systems
in
thermal
equilibrium
.

The
entropy
of
an
isolated
system
in
thermal
equilibrium
containing
an
amount
of
energy
of
E
is
:
where
\
Omega
\
left
(
E
\
right
)
is
the
number
of
quantum
states
in
a
small
interval
between
E
and
E
+
\
delta
E.
Here
\
delta
E
is
a
macroscopically
small
energy
interval
that
is
kept
fixed
.

Strictly
speaking
this
means
that
the
entropy
depends
on
the
choice
of
\
delta
E.
However
,
in
the
thermodynamic
limit
(
i.e.
in
the
limit
of
infinitely
large
system
size
)
,
the
specific
entropy
(
entropy
per
unit
volume
or
per
unit
mass
)
does
not
depend
on
\
delta
E.
Suppose
we
have
an
isolated
system
whose
macroscopic
state
is
specified
by
a
number
of
variables
.

These
macroscopic
variables
can
,
e.g.
,
refer
to
the
total
volume
,
the
positions
of
pistons
in
the
system
,
etc.
.

Then
\
Omega
will
depend
on
the
values
of
these
variables
.

If
a
variable
is
not
fixed
,
(
e.g.
we
do
not
clamp
a
piston
in
a
certain
position
)
,
then
because
all
the
accessible
states
are
equally
likely
in
equilibrium
,
the
free
variable
in
equilibrium
will
be
such
that
\
Omega
is
maximized
as
that
is
the
most
probable
situation
in
equilibrium
.

If
the
variable
was
initially
fixed
to
some
value
then
upon
release
and
when
the
new
equilibrium
has
been
reached
,
the
fact
the
variable
will
adjust
itself
so
that
\
Omega
is
maximized
,
implies
that
the
entropy
will
have
increased
or
it
will
have
stayed
the
same
(
if
the
value
at
which
the
variable
was
fixed
happened
to
be
the
equilibrium
value
)
.

The
entropy
of
a
system
that
is
not
in
equilibrium
can
be
defined
as
:
see
here
.

Here
the
P
_
is
the
probabilities
for
the
system
to
be
found
in
the
states
labeled
by
the
subscript
j.
In
thermal
equilibrium
the
probabilities
for
states
inside
the
energy
interval
\
delta
E
are
all
equal
to
0
/
\
Omega
,
and
in
that
case
the
general
definition
coincides
with
the
previous
definition
of
S
that
applies
to
the
case
of
thermal
equilibrium
.

Suppose
we
start
from
an
equilibrium
situation
and
we
suddenly
remove
a
constraint
on
a
variable
.

Then
right
after
we
do
this
,
there
are
a
number
\
Omega
of
accessible
microstates
,
but
equilibrium
has
not
yet
been
reached
,
so
the
actual
probabilities
of
the
system
being
in
some
accessible
state
are
not
yet
equal
to
the
prior
probability
of
0
/
\
Omega
.

We
have
already
seen
that
in
the
final
equilibrium
state
,
the
entropy
will
have
increased
or
have
stayed
the
same
relative
to
the
previous
equilibrium
state
.

Boltzmann
's
H-theorem
,
however
,
proves
that
the
entropy
will
increase
continuously
as
a
function
of
time
during
the
intermediate
out
of
equilibrium
state
.

Derivation
of
the
entropy
change
for
reversible
processes
The
second
part
of
the
Second
Law
states
that
the
entropy
change
of
a
system
undergoing
a
reversible
process
is
given
by
:
where
the
temperature
is
defined
as
:
See
here
for
the
justification
for
this
definition
.

Suppose
that
the
system
has
some
external
parameter
,
x
,
that
can
be
changed
.

In
general
,
the
energy
eigenstates
of
the
system
will
depend
on
x.
According
to
the
adiabatic
theorem
of
quantum
mechanics
,
in
the
limit
of
an
infinitely
slow
change
of
the
system
's
Hamiltonian
,
the
system
will
stay
in
the
same
energy
eigenstate
and
thus
change
its
energy
according
to
the
change
in
energy
of
the
energy
eigenstate
it
is
in
.

The
generalized
force
,
X
,
corresponding
to
the
external
variable
x
is
defined
such
that
X
dx
is
the
work
performed
by
the
system
if
x
is
increased
by
an
amount
dx
.

E.g.
,
if
x
is
the
volume
,
then
X
is
the
pressure
.

The
generalized
force
for
a
system
known
to
be
in
energy
eigenstate
E
_
is
given
by
:
Since
the
system
can
be
in
any
energy
eigenstate
within
an
interval
of
\
delta
E
,
we
define
the
generalized
force
for
the
system
as
the
expectation
value
of
the
above
expression
:
To
evaluate
the
average
,
we
partition
the
\
Omega
\
left
(
E
\
right
)
energy
eigenstates
by
counting
how
many
of
them
have
a
value
for
\
frac
within
a
range
between
Y
and
Y
+
\
delta
Y.
Calling
this
number
\
Omega
_
\
left
(
E
\
right
)
,
we
have
:
The
average
defining
the
generalized
force
can
now
be
written
:
We
can
relate
this
to
the
derivative
of
the
entropy
w.r.t.
x
at
constant
energy
E
as
follows
.

Suppose
we
change
x
to
x
+
dx
.

Then
\
Omega
\
left
(
E
\
right
)
will
change
because
the
energy
eigenstates
depend
on
x
,
causing
energy
eigenstates
to
move
into
or
out
of
the
range
between
E
and
E
+
\
delta
E.
Let
's
focus
again
on
the
energy
eigenstates
for
which
\
frac
lies
within
the
range
between
Y
and
Y
+
\
delta
Y.
Since
these
energy
eigenstates
increase
in
energy
by
Y
dx
,
all
such
energy
eigenstates
that
are
in
the
interval
ranging
from
E
–
Y
dx
to
E
move
from
below
E
to
above
E.
There
are
such
energy
eigenstates
.

If
Y
dx
\
leq
\
delta
E
,
all
these
energy
eigenstates
will
move
into
the
range
between
E
and
E
+
\
delta
E
and
contribute
to
an
increase
in
\
Omega
.

The
number
of
energy
eigenstates
that
move
from
below
E
+
\
delta
E
to
above
E
+
\
delta
E
is
,
of
course
,
given
by
N
_
\
left
(
E
+
\
delta
E
\
right
)
.

The
difference
is
thus
the
net
contribution
to
the
increase
in
\
Omega
.

Note
that
if
Y
dx
is
larger
than
\
delta
E
there
will
be
the
energy
eigenstates
that
move
from
below
E
to
above
E
+
\
delta
E.
They
are
counted
in
both
N
_
\
left
(
E
\
right
)
and
N
_
\
left
(
E
+
\
delta
E
\
right
)
,
therefore
the
above
expression
is
also
valid
in
that
case
.

Expressing
the
above
expression
as
a
derivative
w.r.t.
E
and
summing
over
Y
yields
the
expression
:
The
logarithmic
derivative
of
\
Omega
w.r.t.
x
is
thus
given
by
:
The
first
term
is
intensive
,
i.e.
it
does
not
scale
with
system
size
.

In
contrast
,
the
last
term
scales
as
the
inverse
system
size
and
will
thus
vanishes
in
the
thermodynamic
limit
.

We
have
thus
found
that

Derivation
for
systems
described
by
the
canonical
ensemble
If
a
system
is
in
thermal
contact
with
a
heat
bath
at
some
temperature
T
then
,
in
equilibrium
,
the
probability
distribution
over
the
energy
eigenvalues
are
given
by
the
canonical
ensemble
:
Here
Z
is
a
factor
that
normalizes
the
sum
of
all
the
probabilities
to
0
,
this
function
is
known
as
the
partition
function
.

We
now
consider
an
infinitesimal
reversible
change
in
the
temperature
and
in
the
external
parameters
on
which
the
energy
levels
depend
.

It
follows
from
the
general
formula
for
the
entropy
:
that
Inserting
the
formula
for
P

for
the
canonical
ensemble
in
here
gives
:
General
derivation
from
unitarity
of
quantum
mechanics
The
time
development
operator
in
quantum
theory
is
unitary
,
because
the
Hamiltonian
is
hermitian
.

Consequently
the
transition
probability
matrix
is
doubly
stochastic
,
which
implies
the
Second
Law
of
Thermodynamics
.

This
derivation
is
quite
general
,
based
on
the
Shannon
entropy
,
and
does
not
require
any
assumptions
beyond
unitarity
,
which
is
universally
accepted
.

It
is
a
consequence
of
the
irreversibility
or
singular
nature
of
the
general
transition
matrix
.

Non-equilibrium
states
It
is
only
by
convention
,
for
the
purposes
of
thermodynamic
analysis
,
that
any
arbitrary
occasion
of
space-time
is
said
to
be
in
thermodynamic
equilibrium
.

In
general
,
an
occasion
of
space-time
found
in
nature
is
not
in
thermodynamic
equilibrium
,
read
in
the
most
stringent
terms
.

In
looser
terms
,
nothing
in
the
entire
universe
is
or
has
ever
been
truly
in
exact
thermodynamic
equilibrium
.

If
it
is
assumed
,
for
the
purposes
of
physical
analysis
,
that
one
is
dealing
with
a
system
in
thermodynamic
equilibrium
,
then
statistically
it
is
possible
for
that
system
to
achieve
moments
of
non-equilibrium
.

In
some
statistically
unlikely
events
,
hot
particles
"
steal
"
the
energy
of
cold
particles
,
enough
that
the
cold
side
gets
colder
and
the
hot
side
gets
hotter
,
for
a
very
brief
time
.

The
physics
involved
in
such
events
is
beyond
the
scope
of
classical
equilibrium
thermodynamics
,
and
is
the
topic
of
the
fluctuation
theorem
(
not
to
be
confused
with
the
fluctuation-dissipation
theorem
)
.

This
was
first
proved
by
Bochov
and
Kuzovlev
,
and
later
by
Evans
and
Searles
.

It
gives
a
numerical
estimate
of
the
probability
that
a
system
away
from
equilibrium
will
have
a
certain
change
in
entropy
over
a
certain
amount
of
time
.

The
theorem
is
proved
with
the
exact
time
reversible
dynamical
equations
of
motion
but
assumes
the
Axiom
of
Causality
,
which
is
equivalent
to
assuming
uncorrelated
initial
conditions
(
namely
,
uncorrelated
past
)
.

Such
events
have
been
observed
at
a
small
enough
scale
where
the
likelihood
of
such
a
thing
happening
is
significant
.

Quantitative
predictions
of
this
theorem
have
been
confirmed
in
laboratory
experiments
by
use
of
optical
tweezers
apparatus
.

Arrow
of
time
The
second
law
of
thermodynamics
is
the
only
physical
law
,
apart
from
certain
rare
interactions
in
particle
physics
,
that
is
not
symmetric
to
reversal
of
the
time
direction
.

The
second
law
is
thought
to
be
the
reason
for
the
difference
between
moving
forward
and
backwards
in
time
,
such
as
why
the
cause
precedes
the
effect
(
the
causal
arrow
of
time
)
.

Controversies
Maxwell
's
demon
James
Clerk
Maxwell
imagined
one
container
divided
into
two
parts
,
A
and
B.
Both
parts
are
filled
with
the
same
gas
at
equal
temperatures
and
placed
next
to
each
other
.

Observing
the
molecule
s
on
both
sides
,
an
imaginary
demon
guards
a
trapdoor
between
the
two
parts
.

When
a
faster-than-average
molecule
from
A
flies
towards
the
trapdoor
,
the
demon
opens
it
,
and
the
molecule
will
fly
from
A
to
B.
The
average
speed
of
the
molecules
in
B
will
have
increased
while
in
A
they
will
have
slowed
down
on
average
.

Since
average
molecular
speed
corresponds
to
temperature
,
the
temperature
decreases
in
A
and
increases
in
B
,
contrary
to
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
.

One
of
the
most
famous
responses
to
this
question
was
suggested
in
0000
by
Leó
Szilárd
and
later
by
Léon
Brillouin
.

Szilárd
pointed
out
that
a
real-life
Maxwell
's
demon
would
need
to
have
some
means
of
measuring
molecular
speed
,
and
that
the
act
of
acquiring
information
would
require
an
expenditure
of
energy
.

But
later
exceptions
were
found
.

Loschmidt
's
paradox
Loschmidt
's
paradox
,
also
known
as
the
reversibility
paradox
,
is
the
objection
that
it
should
not
be
possible
to
deduce
an
irreversible
process
from
time-symmetric
dynamics
.

This
puts
the
time
reversal
symmetry
of
nearly
all
known
low-level
fundamental
physical
processes
at
odds
with
any
attempt
to
infer
from
them
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
which
describes
the
behavior
of
macroscopic
systems
.

Both
of
these
are
well-accepted
principles
in
physics
,
with
sound
observational
and
theoretical
support
,
yet
they
seem
to
be
in
conflict
;
hence
the
paradox
.

Due
to
this
paradox
,
derivations
of
the
Second
Law
have
to
make
an
assumption
regarding
the
past
,
namely
that
the
system
is
uncorrelated
at
some
time
in
the
past
,
or
-
equivalently
-
that
the
entropy
in
the
past
was
lower
than
in
the
future
.

This
assumption
is
usually
thought
as
a
boundary
condition
,
and
thus
the
second
Law
is
ultimately
derived
from
the
initial
conditions
of
the
Big
Bang
.

Gibbs
paradox
In
statistical
mechanics
,
a
simple
derivation
of
the
entropy
of
an
ideal
gas
based
on
the
Boltzmann
distribution
yields
an
expression
for
the
entropy
which
is
not
extensive
(
is
not
proportional
to
the
amount
of
gas
in
question
)
.

This
leads
to
an
apparent
paradox
known
as
the
Gibbs
paradox
,
allowing
,
for
instance
,
the
entropy
of
closed
systems
to
decrease
,
violating
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
.

The
paradox
is
averted
by
recognizing
that
the
identity
of
the
particles
does
not
influence
the
entropy
.

In
the
conventional
explanation
,
this
is
associated
with
an
indistinguishability
of
the
particles
associated
with
quantum
mechanics
.

However
,
a
growing
number
of
papers
now
take
the
perspective
that
it
is
merely
the
definition
of
entropy
that
is
changed
to
ignore
particle
permutation
(
and
thereby
avert
the
paradox
)
.

The
resulting
equation
for
the
entropy
(
of
a
classical
ideal
gas
)
is
extensive
,
and
is
known
as
the
Sackur-Tetrode
equation
.

Poincaré
recurrence
theorem
The
Poincaré
recurrence
theorem
states
that
certain
systems
will
,
after
a
sufficiently
long
time
,
return
to
a
state
very
close
to
the
initial
state
.

The
Poincaré
recurrence
time
is
the
length
of
time
elapsed
until
the
recurrence
,
which
is
of
the
order
of
\
sim
\
exp
\
left
(
S/k
\
right
)
.

The
result
applies
to
physical
systems
in
which
energy
is
conserved
.

The
Recurrence
theorem
apparently
contradicts
the
Second
law
of
thermodynamics
,
which
says
that
large
dynamical
systems
evolve
irreversibly
towards
the
state
with
higher
entropy
,
so
that
if
one
starts
with
a
low-entropy
state
,
the
system
will
never
return
to
it
.

There
are
many
possible
ways
to
resolve
this
paradox
,
but
none
of
them
is
universally
accepted
.

The
most
reasonable
argument
is
that
for
typical
thermodynamical
systems
the
recurrence
time
is
so
large
(
many
many
times
longer
than
the
lifetime
of
the
universe
)
that
,
for
all
practical
purposes
,
one
can
not
observe
the
recurrence
.

Heat
death
of
the
universe
According
to
the
second
law
,
the
entropy
of
any
isolated
system
,
such
as
the
entire
universe
,
never
decreases
.

If
the
entropy
of
the
universe
has
no
maximum
upper
bound
then
eventually
the
universe
will
have
no
thermodynamic
free
energy
to
sustain
motion
or
life
,
that
is
,
the
heat
death
is
reached
.

History
Forty
original
settlers
arrived
from
Connecticut
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
set
up
temporary
cabins
near
the
confluence
of
the
Lackawanna
and
Susquehanna
rivers
.

One
of
the
first
settlers
was
Zebulon
Marcy
,
from
whom
Marcy
Township
,
now
Duryea
borough
,
got
its
name
.

He
built
the
first
log
cabin
in
0000
on
the
west
side
of
the
present
Main
Street
of
Duryea
not
far
from
the
Old
Forge
line
.

As
more
settlers
located
in
the
area
,
the
development
of
mining
caused
the
citizenry
to
petition
for
township
status
.

Marcy
Township
was
founded
in
0000
with
a
population
of
0,000
.

A
census
of
the
township
in
0000
noted
a
population
of
0,000
and
000
dwellings
in
a
settlement
.

Duryea
grew
in
population
and
listed
0,000
taxables
and
0,000
registered
voters
in
0000
.

The
borough
was
incorporated
on
May
00
,
0000
.

Doctor
J.A.
Burlington
was
elected
as
the
first
burgess
.

Duryea
Borough
was
named
in
honor
of
Hiram
Duryea
,
an
American
Civil
War
general
and
owner
of
extensive
tracts
of
land
in
sections
of
the
country
.

He
was
a
prominent
figure
in
the
starch
industry
,
a
coal
operator
and
an
official
of
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
and
Western
Railroad
.

It
was
the
practice
of
this
railroad
to
name
its
section
stops
after
officials
of
the
line
,
hence
the
name
of
Duryea
.

Farming
was
the
principal
occupation
in
the
earliest
days
.

Pioneer
settlers
found
many
portions
of
the
land
suitable
for
raising
food
that
they
needed
for
existence
.

Shortly
after
,
mining
would
become
the
area
's
greatest
source
of
prosperity
,
along
with
silk
mills
and
stone
quarries
.

As
of
0000
,
Duryea
had
a
population
of
approximately
0,000
residents
and
had
of
road
.

The
borough
is
northeast
of
Wilkes-Barre
and
north
of
Pittston
.

The
borough
held
a
centennial
celebration
in
0000
.

In
September
of
0000
,
Hurricane
Irene
and
Tropical
Storm
Lee
caused
flooding
.

It
destroyed
many
homes
along
the
Lackawanna
River
in
Duryea
,
stretching
from
Phoenix
Street
to
Elm
Street
.

Elevated
train
tracks
near
the
Weis
Markets
and
other
stores
and
the
dyke
along
the
Lackawanna
,
along
with
a
small
hill
leading
to
Phoenix
Street
and
another
hill
along
Main
Street
and
beyond
Elm
,
created
a
basin
,
inside
of
which
most
houses
were
flooded
.

A
small
number
of
houses
across
from
the
cemetery
received
little
to
no
water
,
while
most
buildings
along
Main
outside
Elm
were
not
flooded
.

Some
houses
that
took
no
water
that
were
just
outside
Elm
were
flooded
with
sewage
,
as
the
drains
backed
up
and
burst
up
into
these
houses
.

Main
Street
buildings
had
less
damage
than
those
buildings
right
next
to
the
levee
and
those
on
Chittenden
,
where
the
water
reached
the
second
floor
.

The
lowest
point
along
Main
Street
inside
the
Basin
only
took
of
water
on
the
first
floor
.

Many
of
the
residents
of
Duryea
who
lived
in
this
basin
have
left
,
while
others
are
trying
to
fix
their
buildings
.

As
of
March
0
,
0000
,
about
five
of
these
buildings
are
finished
,
and
only
four
are
inhabited
.

Mining
and
industry
affecting
environment
and
population
(
first
half
of
00th
century
)
Like
many
of
the
surrounding
towns
(
Pittston
,
Hughestown
,
Old
Forge
)
,
Duryea
lost
population
when
the
need
for
deep-mined
coal
diminished
.

Three
large
colliers
once
operated
there
,
processing
the
coal
for
transport
.

As
in
the
other
nearby
towns
,
the
coal
was
often
mined
directly
under
the
town
itself
.

Remnants
of
strip
mines
and
culm
banks
that
were
never
properly
cleaned
up
and
redeveloped
litter
the
landscape
.

On
the
other
side
of
the
Lackawanna
River
,
sand
and
gravel
quarry
operations
continue
to
spoil
what
was
once
a
beautiful
landscape
and
riverway
.

The
Lackawanna
River
is
heavily
polluted
with
the
outflow
from
abandoned
mine
tunnels
and
is
choked
with
orange
sediment
.

Population
has
been
declining
for
years
,
with
increased
gentrification
.

Loss
of
independence
from
surrounding
towns
(
Pittston
)
(
last
half
of
00th
century
)
Duryea
was
once
fiercely
independent
.

Primarily
populated
by
Polish
immigrants
and
their
descendants
,
the
town
benefited
from
the
coal
industry
and
silk
mills
and
was
a
self-contained
community
with
its
own
Main
Street
and
School
District
.

After
the
death
of
coal
and
the
loss
of
the
silk
mill
,
the
town
encouraged
the
likes
of
Schott
Optical
and
Topps
Bubble
Gum
to
establish
medium-sized
plants
in
the
town
.

However
,
these
would
never
replace
the
jobs
and
revenue
provided
by
coal
.

Declining
population
added
to
the
problem
and
resulted
in
the
takeover
of
the
town
's
schools
by
the
Pittston
Area
School
District
.

These
were
eventually
phased
out
and
shut
down
with
Duryea
Elementary
being
shut
down
in
0000
.

Parents
now
had
no
choice
but
to
bus
their
children
to
the
new
elementary
and
middle
schools
in
Pittston
00
–
00
minutes
away
.

Industry
in
the
00st
century
Investment
spurred
by
Marcellus
Shale
natural
gas
exploration
in
the
areas
surrounding
Duryea
has
transformed
an
antiquated
,
weed-ridden
rail
yard
in
Duryea
,
known
as
the
Pittston
Yard
,
into
a
transloading
terminal
teeming
with
rail
and
trucking
activity
.

The
yard
transloads
sand
from
rail
cars
to
trucks
for
use
in
Marcellus
Shale
gas
drilling
operations
.

The
Reading
&
Northern
Railroad
Co.
invested
in
Pittston
Yard
in
late
0000
and
early
0000
,
laying
track
to
accommodate
000
new
rail
cars
and
constructing
a
facility
to
store
and
hold
up
to
000
cars
of
sand
to
be
used
in
hydraulic
fracturing
,
or
“
fracking

”
operations
at
Marcellus
Shale
drill
sites
throughout

Economy
In

,
a
controversial
Walmart
store
was
proposed
on
U.S.
Route
00
within
the
borough
.

Although
the
economic
,
environmental
,

transportation-related
impacts

a
"
big
box
"
store
within

limits

of
great
concern

remained
polarized

negative
impacts

potential
economic
gains

A
Walmart
Supercenter
was
already
under
construction
in

Township

The
issues

the
potential
job-loss
at
nearby
Price
Chopper
and
Gerrity
's
supermarkets
,
to
further
stresses
to
the
Hicks
Creek
watershed
and
subsequent
flooding
to
recently-added
housing
developments
,
such
as
Wildflower
Village
,
to
the
several-thousand-car-and-truck
per-day
influx
on
the
limited
transportation
infrastructure
.

Members
of
the
community
were
prompted
to
form
"
Exeter
First
"
in
order
"
to
promote
efficient
use
of
existing
resources
,
and
encourage
sustainable
growth
and
development
of
Exeter
Borough
,
including
how
these
actions
affect
surrounding
communities

Their
central
goal
was
to
bring
to

the
common
impacts
of
Walmart

History
Pre-incorporation
Joseph
Birkbeck
,
the
founder
of
Birbeckville
,
was
born
near
Brough
under
Stainmore
,
in
the
county
of
Westmorland
,
England
,
on
May
0
,
0000
.

He
and
his
wife
Elizabeth
came
to
America
in
0000
.

After
acquiring
land
from
Edward
Lynch
the
same
year
of
his
arrival
,
Birkbeck
built
a
log
cabin
in
the
region
that
is
the
small
valley
between
Freeland
and
Upper
Lehigh
.

The
next
settler
,
Nathan
Howey
,
purchased
land
from
Birkbeck
and
built
a
frame
house
just
west
of
Birkbeck
's
log
cabin
.

Developing
coal
mine
s
in
the
nearby
region
created
a
steep
increase
in
population
and
a
demand
for
building
lots
.

This
led
Birkbeck
to
survey
the
region
for
the
town
of
South
Heberton
.

South
Heberton
has
long
since
lost
its
identity
and
is
now
simply
a
cluster
of
houses
midway
between
Freeland
and
Upper
Lehigh
.

Birkbeck
's
sawmill
is
at
the
turn
of
the
road
just
east
of
Upper
Lehigh
,
and
what
was
mainly
South
Heberton
is
now
known
as
Upper
Lehigh
,
a
small
mining
town
once
owned
by
the
Upper
Lehigh
company
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
Birkbeck
cut
the
road
now
known
as
Buck
Mountain
Road
through
the
woods
from
South
Heberton
through
Eckley
Miners
'
Village
to
Buck
Mountain
.

Eckley
was
then
known
as
Shingletown
,
as
the
chief
industry
there
was
the
production
of
shingles
.

The
first
child
born
at
South
Heberton
was
Elizabeth
Birkbeck
,
the
daughter
of
founder
Joseph
Birkbeck
and
his
wife
Elizabeth
,
in
0000
.

The
first
death
at
this
place
was
that
of
William
,
the
son
of
Joseph
and
Elizabeth
Birkbeck
,
which
occurred
February
00
,
0000
.

He
was
four
years
old
at
the
time
.

The
first
store
at
South
Heberton
was
kept
by
a
man
named
Feist
,
which
was
just
west
of
Birkbeck
's
cabin
.

Soon
afterward
another
small
store
was
run
by
a
Mr.
Mining
.

The
first
tavern
was
founded
by
N.
Howes
,
the
second
settler
of
the
region
.

Previous
to
the
opening
of
Howes
's
tavern
,
Birkbeck
accommodated
parties
who
were
prospecting
in
this
region
for
anthracite
deposits
in
his
own
home
.

A
frame
school
was
built
in
0000
,
and
by
0000
the
population
numbered
000
.

Freeland
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
in
0000
.

Post-incorporation
In
0000
,
the
first
Slovak
Lutheran
Church
in
America
was
organized
in
Freeland
.

The
population
steadily
grew
due
to
the
coal
mining
popularity
and
European
immigration
up
until
the
mid-00th
century
.

During
the
last
few
decades
,
Freeland
's
population
has
been
declining
while
the
median
age
has
been
rising
and
is
now
00
years
,
four
years
higher
than
Pennsylvania
's
median
age
.

This
is
mainly
due
to
the
decline
of
the
coal
industry
,
which
was
the
sole
appeal
to
new
immigrants
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Mary

Byzantine
Catholic
Church

History
The
town
of
Glen
Lyon
was
founded
after
anthracite
coal
mining
began
in
that
section
of
Newport
Township
ca.
0000
.

The
colliery
was
operated
by
the
Susquehannah
Coal
Company
,
a
Pennsylvania
Railroad
property
.

The
west
side
of
the
town
was
once
called
Morgantown
;
the
east
side
,
Williamstown
.

Later
the
railroad
built
Glen
Lyon
Station
as
its
local
terminus
,
and
the
town
received
that
name
.

A
part
of
the
east
side
,
separated
from
the
rest
by
the
railroad
,
became
known
as
Canada
.

Roads
and
a
streetcar
line
linked
the
town
to
Nanticoke
and
Wilkes-Barre
.

The
streetcar
line
was
replaced
eventually
by
buses
and
automobiles
as
the
main
means
of
transport
.

The
two
parts
of
the
town
were
divided
by
a
knuckle
of
hill
on
which
Sixth
Shaft
was
dug
into
the
earth
.

Coal
hoisted
from
that
mine
was
moved
across
a
bridge
to
the
breaker
(
coal
processing
plant
)
built
in
0000
.

Gravity
moved
the
coal
through
processes
of
washing
,
removing
rocks
and
sizing
for
different
uses
.

The
coal
came
out
at
north
end
of
the
breaker
for
loading
into
railroad
cars
and
trucks
.

The
Seventh
Shaft
colliery
operated
for
some
years
west
of
town
,
linked
to
the
breaker
by
a
narrow
gauge
railroad
.

The
town
originally
was
developed
by
Welsh
miners
who
were
Protestants
,
usually
members
of
the
Methodist
Church
.

There
was
a
small
Methodist
church
on
Market
Street
.

Later
,
immigrants
from
Eastern
and
Southern
Europe
became
predominant
.

Two
Polish
Roman
Catholic
parishes
,
Saint
Adalbert
's
and
Saint
Michael
's
,
were
founded
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
.

Their
churches
were
built
on
the
west
side
of
the
breaker
.

Other
Eastern
European
miners
and
their
families
belonged
to
Ukrainian
or
"
Byzantine
Rite
"
parishes
on
the
east
side
of
the
town
.

A
company-operated
store
existed
for
a
time
,
but
it
closed
in
the
0000s
.

Commercial
structures
grew
up
on
Nanticoke
Street
,
later
Main
Street
,
providing
food
and
supplies
.

Several
neighborhood
taverns
existed
throughout
the
town
.

Glen
Lyon
's
miners
were
involved
in
unionization
activities
,
culminating
in
their
representation
by
the
United
Mine
Workers
.

Mining
declined
after
the
Second
World
War
.

The
M.
A.
Hanna
Company
closed
Seventh
Shaft
but
retained
Sixth
Shaft
and
the
breaker
into
the
0000s
.

The
breaker
stood
idle
for
three
years
after
closing
finally
in
0000
.

It
burned
overnight
in
October
0000
.

The
death
of
the
deep
mines
after
the
Knox
Mine
Disaster
of
0000
also
diminished
the
town
.

Some
strip
mining
continued
for
years
thereafter
.

Small
dress
factories
provided
employment
,
mostly
for
women
,
in
the
period
when
mining
was
in
decline
;
but
they
too
closed
.

Retirees
formed
a
large
portion
of
the
population
.

The
town
was
linked
to
markets
for
coal
by
truck
even
after
rail
shipments
ceased
.

Many
business
closed
as
deep
mining
declined
,
and
increasing
numbers
of
houses
stood
vacant
.

The
0000

The
Miracle
of
the
Bells
is
nominally
set
in
Glen
Lyon

some

History
Sugarloaf
Massacre
During
the
height
of
the
American
Revolution
in
the
summer
of
0000
,
British
sympathizers
,
known
as
Tories
,
concentrated
from
New
York
's
Mohawk
Valley
,
began
attacking
patriot
outposts
located
along
the
Susquehanna
River
Valley
in
Northeast
Pennsylvania
.

Because
of
the
reports
of
Tory
activity
in
the
region
,
Captain
Daniel
Klader
and
a
platoon
of
00
to
00
men
from
Northampton
County
were
sent
to
investigate
.

They
traveled
north
from
the
Lehigh
Valley
along
a
path
known
as
"
Warrior
's
Trail
,
"
which
is
present-day
State
Route
00
,
since
this
route
connects
the
Lehigh
River
in
Jim
Thorpe
(
formerly
known
as
Mauch
Chunk
)
to
the
Susquehanna
River
in
Berwick
.

Heading
north
,
Captain
Klader
's
men
made
it
as
far
north
as
present-day
Conyngham
when
they
were
ambushed
by
members
of
the
Seneca
tribe
and
Tory
militiamen
.

In
all
,
00
men
were
killed
on
September
00
,
0000
in
what
was
to
become
the
Sugarloaf
Massacre
.

The
Moravians
,
a
Christian
denomination
,
had
been
using
"
Warrior
's
Trail
"
since
the
early
00th
century
after
the
Moravian
missionary
Nicolaus
Ludwig
Zinzendorf
first
used
it
to
reach
the
Wyoming
Valley
.

This
particular
stretch
of
"
Warrior
's
Trail
"
had
an
abundance
of
hazel
trees
.

Though
the
Moravians
called
the
region
"
St.
Anthony
's
Wilderness
"
,
it
eventually
became
known
as
"
Hazel
Swamp
,
"
a
name
which
had
been
used
previously
by
the
Indians
.

The
Moravian
missionaries
were
sent
from
their
settlements
near
Bethlehem
to
the
site
of
the
Sugarloaf
Massacre
to
bury
the
dead
soldiers
.

Because
of
the
aesthetic
natural
beauty
of
the
Conyngham
Valley
,
some
Moravians
decided
to
stay
and
in
0000
,
built
a
settlement
,
St.
Johns
,
along
the
Nescopeck
Creek
,
which
is
near
the
present-day
intersection
of
Interstates
00
and
00
.

Jacob
Drumheller
's
Stage
Stand
In
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
,
the
"
Warrior
Trail
"
was
widened
and
became
the
Berwick
Turnpike
.

Later
,
a
road
was
built
to
connect
Wilkes-Barre
to
McKeansburg
.

This
road
intersected
with
the
Berwick
Turnpike
at
what
is
present-day
Broad
and
Vine
Streets
,
in
downtown
Hazleton
.

An
entrepreneur
named
Jacob
Drumheller
decided
that
this
intersection
was
the
perfect
location
for
a
rest-stop
,
so
in
0000
,
he
built
the
first
building
in
what
would
be
later
known
as
Hazleton
.

Though
a
few
buildings
and
houses
began
to
be
built
nearby
,
the
area
remained
a
dense
wilderness
for
about
00
more
years
.

Aside
from
small-scale
logging
,
the
area
offered
little
else
.

Discovery
of
coal
Railroad
developers
from
Philadelphia
became
interested
in
the
Hazleton
area
once
previous
rumors
were
validated
that
in
0000
anthracite
coal
deposits
had
been
discovered
in
near-by
Beaver
Meadows
by
prospectors
Nathaniel
Beach
and
Tench
Coxe
.

A
young
engineer
from
New
York
named
Ariovistus
"
Ario
"
Pardee
was
hired
to
survey
the
topography
of
Beaver
Meadows
and
report
the
practicality
of
extending
a
railroad
from
the
Lehigh
River
Canal
in
Jim
Thorpe
to
Beaver
Meadows
.

Pardee
,
knowing
that
the
area
of
Beaver
Meadows
was
already
controlled
by
Coxe
and
Beach
,
bought
many
acres
of
the
land
in
present-day
Hazleton
.

The
investment
proved
to
be
extraordinarily
lucrative
.

The
land
contained
part
of
a
massive
anthracite
coal
field
.

Pardee
will
be
forever
known
as
the
founding
father
of
Hazleton
.

Pardee
incorporated
the
Hazleton
Coal
Company
in
0000
,
the
same
year
that
the
rail
link
to
the
Lehigh
Valley
market
was
about
to
be
completed
.

The
Hazleton
Coal
Company
built
the
first
school
on
Church
Street
,
where
Hazleton
City
Hall
is
now
located
.

Pardee
also
built
the
first
church
in
Hazleton
located
at
Church
and
Broad
Streets
.

The
Pardee
mansion
was
built
on
the
northern
block
of
Broad
Street
,
between
present-day
Church
and
Laurel
Streets
.

The
coal
industry
attracted
many
immigrants
for
labour
,
mostly
German
and
Irish
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
and
mostly
Italian
,
Polish
,
Russian
,
Lithuanian
,
and
Slovak
in
the
0000s
to
0000s
.

The
coal
mined
in
Hazleton
helped
to
establish
the
United
States
as
a
world
industrial
power
,
primarily
fueling
the
massive
blast
furnaces
at
the
Bethlehem
Steel
Corporation
.
"

Patch
Towns
"
Many
small
company
towns
,
often
referred
to
by
locals
as
"
patch
towns
,
"
surrounded
Hazleton
and
were
built
by
coal
companies
to
provide
housing
for
the
miners
and
their
families
.

The
patch
towns
included
:
Sudden
prosperity
and
growth
Hazleton
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
January
0
,
0000
.

Its
intended
name
was
supposed
to
be
spelled
"
Hazelton
"
but
a
clerk
misspelled
the
name
during
incorporation
,
and
the
name
"
Hazleton
"
has
been
used
ever
since
.

The
borough
's
first
fire
company
,
the
Pioneer
Fire
Company
,
was
organized
in
0000
by
soldiers
returning
from
the
American
Civil
War
.

Hazleton
was
incorporated
as
a
city
on
December
0
,
0000
.

The
population
then
was
estimated
to
be
around
00,000
people
.

In
0000
,
Hazleton
became
the
third
city
in
the
United
States
to
establish
a
city-wide
electric
grid
.

On
September
00
,
0000
,
the
Lattimer
Massacre
occurred
near
Hazleton
.

Post
WWII
Hazleton
After
World
War
II
,
the
demand
for
coal
began
to
decline
as
cleaner
,
more
efficient
fuels
were
being
used
.

Readily
available
,
cheap
energy
helped
open
the
door
for
manufacturing
.

The
Duplan
Silk
Corporation
opened
and
became
the
world
's
largest
silk
mill
.

The
garment
industry
thrived
and
was
invested
in
by
New
York
mobster
Albert
Anastasia
.
.

In
0000
,
Autolite
Corporation
was
looking
to
expand
operations
in
the
East
,
and
had
been
looking
into
Hazleton
.

Officials
from
Autolite
came
to
the
area
to
survey
it
and
in
their
report
,
they
noted
Hazleton
is
a
"
mountain
wilderness
"
with
no
major
water
route
,
rail
route
,
trucking
route
,
or
airport
.

In
response
,
several
area
leaders
gathered
to
address
these
problems
.

CAN-DO
(
Community
Area
New
Development
Organization
)
was
formally
organized
in
0000
by
founder
Dr.
Edgar
L.
Dessen
.

Their
main
goal
was
to
raise
money
,
through
their
"
Dime
A
Week
"
campaign
,
in
which
area
residents
were
encouraged
to
put
a
dime
on
their
sidewalk
each
week
to
be
collected
by
CANDO
.

The
company
raised
over
$
000,000
and
was
able
to
purchase
over
of
land
,
which
was
converted
into
an
industrial
park
.

Because
of
CANDO
's
efforts
,
Hazleton
was
given
the
All-America
City
Award
in
0000
.

Hazleton
's
economy
is
now
based
largely
on
manufacturing
and
shipping
,
facilitated
by
the
relative
closeness
to
Interstates
00
and
00
.

An
article
published
in
December
0000
by
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
was
entitled
"
Letter
from
Pennsylvania
:
A
town
in
need
of
a
tomorrow
"
which
reported
Hazleton
's
shortcomings
to
the
world
.

It
was
criticized
by
local
politicians
and
business
leaders
alike
,
and
again
prompted
local
leaders
to
address
the
problems
facing
the
community
.

Coming
to
grips
with
changing
demographics
and
a
new
wave
of
immigrants
In
0000
,
Hazleton
gained
national
attention
as
Republican
mayor
Lou
Barletta
and
council
members
passed
the
Illegal
Immigration
Relief
Act
.

This
ordinance
was
instituted
to
discourage
hiring
or
renting
to
illegal
immigrants
.

Initially
,
an
administrative
fine
on
landlords
for
$
0,000
per
illegal
immigrant
rented
to
and
a
loss
of
permits
for
non-compliance
has
been
passed
.

Leaders
from
other
communities
across
the
United
States
have
requested
information
on
this
proposal
for
use
in
their
own
municipalities
.

Another
act
passed
concurrently
made
English
the
official
language
of
Hazleton
.

The
ordinance
has
been
criticized
as
illegal
and
unconstitutional
.

A
number
of
Hispanic
residents
(
both
legal
and
illegal
)
filed
suit
to
strike
down
the
law
,
claiming
it
violates
the
Supremacy
Clause
of
the
U.S.
Constitution
as
well
as
the
First
and
Fourteenth
Amendment
s
to
the
Constitution
.

A
copy
of
the
court
complaint
is
available
from
the
Pennsylvania
ACLU
.

In
an
agreement
,
announced
on
September
0
,
with
the
ACLU
,
the
Puerto
Rican
Legal
Defense
and
Education
Fund
and
the
Community
Justice
Project
,
Hazleton
will
not
enforce
the
ordinance
.

In
response
to
the
lawsuits
the
city
of
Hazleton
has
retained
the
counsel
of
the
former
head
of
immigration
in
the
Department
of
Justice
.

Mayor
Lou
Barletta
of
Hazleton
estimated
that
as
"
many
as
half
"
of
the
estimated
00,000
Hispanics
who
were
living
in
Hazleton
left
Hazleton
when
the
ordinance
was
passed
.

The
issue
was
covered
by
the
television
program
00
Minutes
in
0000
and
the
Fox
News
show

The
Vickers
Wellington
was
a
British
twin-engine
,
long
range
medium
bomber
designed
in
the
mid-0000s
at
Brooklands
in
Weybridge
,
Surrey
,
by
Vickers-Armstrongs
'
Chief
Designer
,
R.
K.
Pierson
in
response
to
specification
B.
0/00
.

Issued
in
the
middle
of
0000
this
called
for
a
twin-engined
day
bomber
of
perceptibly
higher
performance
than
any
previous
designs
.

It
was
widely
used
as
a
night
bomber
in
the
early
years
of
the
Second
World
War
,
before
being
displaced
as
a
bomber
by
the
larger
four-engine
"
heavies
"
such
as
the
Avro
Lancaster
.

The
Wellington
continued
to
serve
throughout
the
war
in
other
duties
,
particularly
as
an
anti-submarine
aircraft
.

It
was
the
only
British
bomber
to
be
produced
for
the
entire
duration
of
the
war
,
and
was
still
first-line
equipment
when
the
war
ended
.

The
Wellington
was
one
of
two
bombers
named
after
Arthur
Wellesley
,
0st
Duke
of
Wellington
,
the
other
being
the
Vickers
Wellesley
.

Design
and
development
The
Wellington
used
a
geodesic
construction
method
,
which
had
been
devised
by
Barnes
Wallis
inspired
by
his
work
on
airship
s
,
and
had
previously
been
used
to
build
the
single-engine
Wellesley
light
bomber
.

The
fuselage
was
built
up
from
0000
elements
,
consisting
of
aluminium
alloy
(
duralumin
)
W-beams
that
were
formed
into
a
large
framework
.

Wooden
batten
s
were
screwed
onto
the
aluminium
,
and
these
were
covered
with
Irish
linen
,
which
,
once
treated
with
many
layers
of
dope
,
formed
the
outer
skin
of
the
aircraft
.

The
metal
lattice
gave
the
structure
tremendous
strength
,
because
any
one
of
the
stringers
could
support
some
of
the
weight
from
even
the
opposite
side
of
the
aircraft
.

Blowing
out
one
side
's
beams
would
still
leave
the
aircraft
as
a
whole
intact
;
as
a
result
,
Wellingtons
with
huge
areas
of
framework
missing
continued
to
return
home
when
other
types
would
not
have
survived
;
the
dramatic
effect
was
enhanced
by
the
doped
fabric
skin
burning
off
,
leaving
the
naked
frames
exposed
(
see
photo
)
.

A
German
Bf
000
night-fighter
attacked
a
Wellington
returning
from
an
attack
on
Münster
,
Germany
,
causing
a
fire
at
the
rear
of
the
starboard
engine
.

Co-pilot
Sergeant
James
Allen
Ward
climbed
out
of
the
fuselage
in
flight
,
kicked
holes
in
the
doped
fabric
of
the
wing
for
foot
and
hand
holds
to
reach
the
starboard
engine
and
smothered
the
burning
upper
wing
covering
.

He
and
the
aircraft
returned
home
safely
,
and
Ward
was
awarded
the
Victoria
Cross
for
his
actions
.

The
geodesic
structure
was
strong
and
light
for
its
size
,
which
gave
the
Wellington
a
load
and
range
to
power
ratio
advantage
over
similar
aircraft
,
without
sacrificing
robustness
or
the
protection
of
armour
plate
or
self-sealing
fuel
tank
s.
The
construction
had
the
disadvantage
of
taking
considerably
longer
to
build
than
other
designs
using
monocoque
construction
techniques
.

It
was
difficult
to
cut
holes
into
the
fuselage
to
provide
access
or
equipment
fixtures
.

The
Leigh
light
was
deployed
through
the
mounting
for
the
absent
FN0
ventral
turret
.

Nonetheless
,
in
the
late
0000s
Vickers
succeeded
in
building
Wellingtons
at
a
rate
of
one
a
day
at
Weybridge
and
00
a
month
at
the
Chester
factory
(
at
Broughton
in
North
Wales
)

conversions

,
first
flew
as
a
Type
000
(
and
initially
named
Crecy
)
from
Brooklands
on
00
June
0000
,
with
chief
test
pilot
Joseph
Summers
as
pilot
.

After
many
changes
to
the
design
,
it
was
accepted
on
00
August
0000
for
production
with
the
name
Wellington
.

The
first
model
was
the
Wellington
Mark
I
,
powered
by
a
pair
of
0,000
hp
(
000
kW
)
Bristol
Pegasus
engines
,
of
which
000
were
built
,
000
for
the
Royal
Air
Force
and
00
for
the
Royal
New
Zealand
Air
Force
(
which
were
transferred
to
the
RAF
on
the
outbreak
of
war
and
used
by
00
Squadron
)
.

The
Mark
I
entered
service
with
No.
0
Squadron
RAF
in
October
0000
.

Improvements
to
the
turrets
resulted
in
000
Mark
IA
Wellingtons
,
which
equipped
the
RAF
Bomber
Command
heavy
bomber
squadrons
at
the
outbreak
of
war
.

The
Wellington
was
initially
outnumbered
by
its
twin-engine
contemporaries
,
the
Handley
Page
Hampden
and
the
Armstrong
Whitworth
Whitley
but
outlasted
them
in
service
.

The
number
of
Wellingtons
built
totalled
00,000
of
all
versions
,
the
last
of
which
was
rolled
out
on
00
October
0000
.

Construction
record
As
a
propaganda
and
morale
boosting
exercise
,
in
October
0000
workers
at
the
Vickers
Broughton
factory
gave
up
their
weekend
to
build
Wellington
number
LN000
against
the
clock
.

The
bomber
was
assembled
in
new
world
record
time
of
00
hours
00
minutes
,
and
took
off
after
00
hours
00
minutes
,
beating
the
previous
record
of
00
hours
set
by
an
American
factory
in
California
.

The
bomber
was
usually
built
within
00
hours
.

The
effort
was
filmed
for
the
Ministry
of
Information
,
forming
the
basis
of
a
newsreel
Worker
's
Week-End
,
broadcast
in
Britain
and
America
.

Operational
history
The
first
RAF
bombing
attack
of
the
war
was
made
by
Wellingtons
of
No.
0
and
No.
000
Squadrons
,
along
with
Bristol
Blenheim
s
,
on
German
shipping
at
Brunsbüttel
on
0
September
0000
.

During
this
raid
,
the
two
Wellingtons
became
the
first
aircraft
shot
down
on
the
Western
Front
.

Numbers
0
,
00
and
000
Squadrons
saw
action
on
00
December
0000
on
a
mission
against
German
shipping
on
the
Schillig
Roads
and
Wilhelmshaven
.

Luftwaffe
fighter
s
destroyed
00
of
the
bombers
and
badly
damaged
three
others
;
thus
highlighting
the
aircraft
's
vulnerability
to
attacking
fighters
,
having
neither
self-sealing
fuel
tanks
nor
sufficient
defensive
armament
.

In
particular
,
while
the
aircraft
's
nose
and
tail
turrets
protected
against
attacks
from
the
front
and
rear
,
the
Wellington
had
no
defences
against
attacks
from
the
beam
and
above
,
as
it
had
not
been
believed
that
such
attacks
were
possible
owing
to
the
high
speed
of
aircraft
involved
.

As
a
consequence
,
Wellingtons
were
switched
to
night
operations
and
participated
in
the
first
night
raid
on
Berlin
on
00
August
0000
.

In
the
first
0,000-aircraft
raid
on
Cologne
,
on
00
May
0000
,
000
out
of
0,000
aircraft
were
Wellingtons
(
000
of
them
were
flown
by
Polish
aircrew
)
.

With
Bomber
Command
,
Wellingtons
flew
00,000
operations
,
dropped
00,000
tons
(
00,000
tonnes
)
of
bombs
and
lost
0,000
aircraft
in
action
.

Coastal
Command
Wellingtons
carried
out
anti-submarine
duties
and
sank
their
first
enemy
vessel
on
0
July
0000
.

DWI
versions
(
see
below
)
fitted
with
a
00
ft
(
00.00
m
)
diameter
metal
hoop
were
used
for
exploding
enemy
mines
by
generating
a
powerful
magnetic
field
as
it
passed
over
them
.

In
0000
,
Wellingtons
of
Coastal
Command
were
deployed
to
Greece
,
and
performed
various
support
duties
during
the
RAF
interference
in
the
Greek
Civil
War
.

A
few
Wellingtons
were
operated
by
the
Hellenic
Air
Force
.

While
the
Wellington
was
superseded
in
the
European
Theatre
,
it
remained
in
operational
service
for
much
of
the
war
in
the
Middle
East
and
in
0000
,
Wellingtons
based
in
India
became
the
RAF
's
first
long-range
bomber
operating
in
the
Far
East
.

It
was
particularly
effective
with
the
South
African
Air
Force
in
North
Africa
.

This
versatile
aircraft
also
served
in
anti-submarine
duties
with
00
Squadron
SAAF
based
in
Takoradi
,
Gold
Coast
(
now
Ghana
)
.

In
late
0000
,
a
radar-equipped
Wellington
was
modified
for
use
by
the
RAF
's
Fighter
Interception
Unit
as
what
would
now
be
described
as
an
Airborne
Early
Warning
and
Control
aircraft
.

It
operated
at
an
altitude
of
some
over
the
North
Sea
to
control
de
Havilland
Mosquito
fighters
intercepting
Heinkel
He
000
bombers
flying
from
Dutch
airbases
and
carrying
out
airborne
launches
of
the
V-0
flying
bomb
.

The
Wellington
is
listed
in
the
appendix
to
the
novel
KG
000
as
one
flown
by
the
German
secret
operations
unit
KG
000
,
which
also
tested
,
evaluated
and
sometimes
clandestinely
operated
captured
enemy
aircraft
during
the
Second
World
War

John
Parmenter
Robarts
,
(
January
00
,
0000
–
October
00
,
0000
)
was
a
Canadian
lawyer
and
statesman
,
and
the
00th
Premier
of
Ontario
.

Early
life
Robarts
was
born
in
Banff
,
Alberta
,
making
him
the
only
Ontario
premier
not
to
have
been
born
in
Ontario
.

As
a
young
man
,
he
moved
to
London
,
Ontario
with
his
family
,
where
he
studied
at
Central
Collegiate
(
today
,
London
Central
Secondary
School
)
and
at
the
University
of
Western
Ontario
in
Business
Administration
.

While
attending
Western
,
he
joined
the
Delta
Upsilon
fraternity
.

He
enrolled
to
study
law
at
Osgoode
Hall
Law
School
,
but
his
education
was
interrupted
by
service
with
the
Royal
Canadian
Navy
during
the
World
War
II
.

He
served
as
an
officer
on
the
HMS
Uganda
.

After
the
war
,
he
returned
to
law
school
and
graduated
in
0000
.

Early
political
career
He
practiced
law
in
London
,
Ontario
,
and
was
elected
a
city
alderman
/
councillor
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
he
was
elected
as
a
Progressive
Conservative
member
of
the
Legislative
Assembly
of
Ontario
from
the
city
.

In
that
era
,
MLAs
not
in
cabinet
were
essentially
working
part-time
,
due
to
relatively
light
legislative
duties
.

Roberts
commuted
by
train
from
the
legislature
Queen
's
Park
in
Toronto
to
his
family
and
law
practice
in
London
,
effectively
combining
his
legislative
work
with
career
.

His
wife
Norah
disliked
Toronto
and
remained
at
home
in
London
for
most
of
their
marriage
.

The
couple
raised
two
children
.

Joins
Frost
cabinet
He
entered
the
cabinet
of
Leslie
Frost
in
0000
as
minister
without
portfolio
,
and
was
promoted
to
Minister
of
Education
in
0000
.

The
province
was
in
the
midst
of
a
major
building
phase
with
its
education
system
,
to
accommodate
an
enormous
increase
in
enrollment
following
the
Baby
Boomer
generation
of
the
post
World
War
II
era
,
and
Robarts
played
an
important
role
as
Education
Minister
,
with
the
establishment
of
new
campuses
such
as
York
University
.

Becomes
premier
In
0000
,
he
became
the
00th
Premier
of
Ontario
,
and
served
in
that
capacity
until
0000
.

A
popular
and
well-respected
leader
,
Robarts
epitomized
power
and
dignity
.

He
was
an
advocate
of
individual
freedoms
,
and
promoted
the
rights
of
the
provinces
against
the
centralizing
initiatives
of
the
federal
government
.

He
also
promoted
national
unity
against
Quebec
separatism
,
and
hosted
the
0000
"
Confederation
of
Tomorrow
"
conference
in
Toronto
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
achieve
an
agreement
for
a
new
Constitution
of
Canada
.

He
initially
opposed
Canadian
Medicare
when
it
was
proposed
,
but
later
endorsed
it
fully
following
NDP
candidate
Kenneth
Bolton
's
upset
by-election
victory
on
the
issue
in
the
London-area
riding
of
Middlesex
South
.

As
a
civil
libertarian
,
and
a
strong
believer
in
the
promotion
of
both
official
languages
,
Robarts
opened
the
door
to
French
language
education
in
Ontario
schools
.

In
0000
he
was
made
a
Companion
of
the
Order
of
Canada
.

Remembered
for
his
steps
to
promote
and
improve
education
,
he
was
responsible
for
the
construction
of
York
University
,
the
Ontario
Science
Centre
,
the
expansion
of
numerous
teacher
colleges
,
and
launching
the
Ontario
Scholarship
fund
.

Post-political
life
After
retiring
from
office
,
John
Robarts
co-chaired
the
Task
Force
on
Canadian
Unity
with
Jean-Luc
Pépin
,
and
joined
the
boards
of
directors
of
several
major
corporations
.

Later
in
his
life
,
he
suffered
a
series
of
debilitating
stroke
s
,
and
he
committed
suicide
on
October
00
,
0000
.

He
is

is
a
city
in
Luzerne
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United

.

It
is
situated
between

The
city
gained
prominence
in
the
late
00th
and
early
00th
centuries
as
an
active
anthracite
coal
mining
city
,
drawing
a
large
portion
of
its
labor
force
from
European
immigrants
.

The
population
was
0,000
as

)
,
the

Section
(

History
Establishment
Pittston
lies
in
the
Wyoming
Valley
on
the
east
side
of
the
Susquehanna
River
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
Lackawanna
River
.

It
is
approximately
midway
between
Wilkes-Barre
and
Scranton
.

Named
after
the
famous
British
statesman
William
Pitt
the
Elder
,
the
city
was
settled
around
0000
by
the
Susquehanna
Company
of
Connecticut
.

It
was
originally
called
"
Pittstown
"
.

During
the
Revolutionary
War
,
Connecticut
Continentals
(
Patriots
)
,
led
by
Captain
Jeremiah
Blanchard
and
Lieutenant
Timothy
Keyes
,
held
and
maintained
a
fort
in
Pittston
.

On
July
0
,
0000
(
one
day
after
the
Battle
of
Wyoming
)
,
a
group
of
British
soldiers
took
over
the
fortress
and
some
of
it
was
destroyed
.

Two
years
later
,
the
Continentals
stormed
the
fortification
and
recaptured
it
.

From
then
on
it
was
under
Patriot
control
until
the
end
of
the
war
in
0000
,
with
the
signing
of
the
Treaty
of
Paris
.

Today
a
marker
stands
at
the
site
where
the
fort
once
stood
.

Pittston
broke
away
from
Pittston
Township
and
officially
became
a
borough
in
0000
.

It
was
later
chartered
as
a
city
on
December
00
,
0000
.

Throughout
the
late
0000s
,
the
city
's
borders
extended
from
Scranton
to
Wilkes-Barre
,
but
due
to
financial
and
civil
differences
,
the
city
would
soon
be
divided
into
the
many
township
s
and
boroughs
that
exist
throughout
the
central
Wyoming
Valley
today
.

Coal
mining
With
the
opening
of
a
canal
in
the
0000s
,
Pittston
became
an
important
link
in
the
coal
industry
.

Money
made
through
the
mining
and
transportation
of
coal
led
some
of
the
leading
merchants
to
petition
its
separation
from
Pittston
Township
.

The
anthracite
and
railroad
industry
attracted
thousands
of
immigrants
,
making
Pittston
a
true
melting
pot

The
anthracite
coal
mining
industry
,
and
its
extensive
use
of
child
labor
in
the
early
part
of
the
00th
century
,
was
one
of
the
industries
targeted
by
the
National
Child
Labor
Committee
and
its
hired
photographer
,
Lewis
Hine
.

Many
of
Hine
's
subjects
were
photographed
in
the
mines
and
coal
fields
in
and
around
Pittston
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
impact
of
the
Hine
photographs
led
to
the
enactment
of
child
labor
laws
across
the
country
.

Mining
disasters
Coal
mining
remained
the
prominent
industry
in
Pittston
for
many
decades
,
but
disasters
did
strike
on
more
than
one
occasion
.

The
first
major
tragedy
occurred
in
the
Newton
Coal
Company
's
Twin
Shaft
Mine
near
the
city
's
railroad
junction
on
June
00
,
0000
,
when
a
massive
cave-in
killed
00
miners
.

Anthracite
coal
mining
remained
in
Pittston
until
January
00
,
0000
,
when
the
Knox
Mine
Disaster
in
nearby
Port
Griffith
in
Jenkins
Township
ended
the
industry
completely
.

There
,
the
ice-laden
Susquehanna
River
broke
through
the
roof
of
the
River
Slope
Mine
of
the
Knox
Coal
Company
,
allowing
billions
of
gallons
of
river
water
to
flood
the
interconnected
mines
.

Seventy-four
miners
were
trapped
;
sixty-two
miners
escaped
;
twelve
miners
died
and
their
bodies
were
never
recovered
.

The
heroic
efforts
of
one
miner
,
Amedeo
Pancotti
of
Pittston
,
led
thirty-two
miners
to
safety
.

For
his
efforts
,
Amedeo
Pancotti
was
awarded
the
Carnegie
Medal
for
heroism
from
the
Carnegie
Hero
Fund
Commission
.

City
's
boom
and

activity
.

The
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
maintained
a
beautiful
station
in
downtown
Pittston
,
near
the
foot

Bridge
.

Sadly
,
the
station
did
not
survive
the
urban
renewal
of
the
0000s
;
it
was
demolished
in
0000
.

Pittston
also
had
a
station
on
the
historic
Lackawanna
and
Wyoming
Valley
Railroad
,
commonly
known
as
the
Laurel
Line
,
an
electric
interurban
streetcar
line
.

00h
centuries
,
including
metal
s
,
plastic
s
,
paper
products
,
apparel

wood-burning
stove
s
for
heating
and
cooking

The
Pittston
Brewing
Company
,
brewers
of
Glennon
's
Beer

the
downtown
,
and
the
nearby
Water
Street
Bridge
was
renamed
to
commemorate
their
sacrifice
during
that
tragic
March
day
.

For
decades
,
the
towering
spires
of
the
many
Protestant
and
Roman
Catholic
churches
dominated
the
city
's
skyline
.

Most
of
the

History
of
Plymouth
(
0000-0000
)
The
Yankee
Era
(
0000-0000
)
The
Susquehanna
Company
and
early
settlementThe
origins
of
Plymouth
(
also
known
as
Shawnee
and
Shawneetown
)
date
back
to
the
creation
of
the
Susquehanna
Company
in
Windham
,
Connecticut
,
on
June
00
,
0000
,
formed
to
promote
the
settlement
of
certain
lands
along
the
Susquehanna
in
what
is
now
northeastern
Pennsylvania
.

This
place
,
called
"
Wyoming
,
"
fell
within
the
bounds
of
the
charter
issued
in
0000
by
Charles
II
to
the
Connecticut
Colony
.

It
also
fell
within
the
bounds
of
the
charter
issued
by
the
same
king
in
0000
to
William
Penn
,
thus
setting
the
stage
for
a
conflict
between
the
two
colonies
.

In
0000
at
Albany
the
Susquehanna
Company
purchased
a
deed
to
a
tract
of
land
along
the
Susquehanna
River
from
the
Iroquois
(
Six
Nations
)
who
had
long
held
the
land
by
right
of
conquest
.

This
purchase
met
with
the
disapproval
of
the
Pennsylvania
proprietors
,
and
with
many
in
Connecticut
,
but
the
Susquehanna
Company
persevered
.

In
0000
,
John
Durkee
and
a
group
of
000
Connecticut
settlers
created
five
townships
,
and
surveyed
their
bounds
,
naming
them
Wilkesbarre
(
later
renamed
Wilkes-Barre
)
,
Nanticoke
(
later
renamed
Hanover
)
,
Pittstown
(
later
renamed
Pittston
)
,
Forty
(
later
renamed
Kingston
)
and
Plymouth
.

During
the
summer
of
0000
,
the
settlers
began
to
survey
and
sub-divide
the
five
townships
into
lots
,
and
settlement
began
in
earnest
in
0000
.

Armed
men
loyal
to
Pennsylvania
twice
attempted
to
evict
the
Connecticut
settlers
in
what
are
known
as
the
Pennamite-Yankee
War
s.
Following
the
American
Revolution
,
and
ratification
of
the
Articles
of
Confederation
in
0000
,
Pennsylvania
sued
to
resolve
the
conflict
with
Connecticut
.

A
trial
was
held
at
Trenton
,
New
Jersey
,
in
0000
,
and
the
conflict
resolved
in
favor
of
Pennsylvania
,
which
was
granted
full
jurisdiction
over
the
Susquehanna
Company
's
lands
.

Years
of
uncertainty
ensued
for
the
Connecticut
settlers
in
the
Wyoming
Valley
,
until
in
April
0000
,
Pennsylvania
passed
the
Compromise
Act
allowing
settlers
(
in
those
townships
which
had
been
created
and
settled
before
the
Trenton
Decree
of
0000
)
to
prove
their
chain
of
title
and
pay
a
fee
in
return
for
certification
of
their
title
.

Thus
,
Plymouth
landowners
who
could
establish
their
chain
of
title
retained
ownership
of
their
land
,
but
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
Pennsylvania
.

The
process
took
years
,
but
by
0000
most
land
claims
had
been
resolved
.

Today
,
all
ownership
of
land
in
Plymouth
can
be
traced
back
to
these
certified
titles
.

The
settingPlymouth
sits
on
the
west
side
of
the
Wyoming
Valley
,
wedged
between
the
Susquehanna
River
and
the
Shawnee
Mountain
range
.

Just
below
the
mountain
are
seven
hills
that
surround
the
town
like
the
hills
of
Rome
,
and
form
a
natural
amphitheater
which
separates
the
town
from
the
rest
of
the
valley
.

Toby
's
Creek
.

Below
the
hills
,
the
flat
lands
are
formed
in
the
shape
of
a
frying
pan
,
the
pan
being
the
Shawnee
flats
,
once
the
center
of
the
town
's
agricultural
activities
,
and
the
handle
being
a
spit
of
narrow
land
extending
east
from
the
flats
,
where
the
center
of
town
is
located
.

The
Smith
Coal
MinesAt
the
beginning
of
the
00th
century
,
Plymouth
's
primary
industry
was
agriculture
.

However
,
vast
anthracite
coal
beds
lay
below
the
surface
at
various
depths
.

At
a
few
locations
these
beds
were
visible
in
the
form
of
outcrops
,
and
one
such
location
was
a
gorge
created
by
Ransom
Creek
(
now
Coal
Creek
)
located
about
a
mile
upstream
from
the
Susquehanna
River
.

Coal
could
be
seen
(
and
accessed
)
on
both
the
east
side
(
Turkey
Hill
)
and
the
west
side
(
Curry
Hill
)
of
the
creek
.

Attracted
by
this
outcrop
,
Abijah
Smith
came
to
Plymouth
about
0000
from
Derby
,
Connecticut
,
intending
to
mine
,
ship
and
sell
coal
.

In
the
fall
of
0000
,
Smith
floated
an
ark
down
the
Susquehanna
River
loaded
with
about
fifty
tons
of
anthracite
coal
,
and
shipped
it
to
Columbia
in
Lancaster
County
.

The
significance
of
Smith
's
shipment
went
unnoticed
until
0000
,
when
Hendrick
B.
Wright
,
in
his
Historical
Sketches
of
Plymouth
,
wrote
,
"
Anthracite
coal
had
been
used
before
0000
,
in
this
valley
and
elsewhere
,
in
small
quantities
in
furnaces
,
with
an
air
blast
;
but
the
traffic
in
coal
as
an
article
of
general
use
,
was
commenced
by
Abijah
Smith
,
of
Plymouth
.
"

By
0000
,
Abijah
Smith
secured
a
patent
for
coal
lands
on
the
east
side
of
the
creek
.

In
0000
,
Smith
's
brother
,
John
Smith
,
began
to
mine
coal
on
the
west
side
of
creek
.

This
second
mine
(
often
called
,
erroneously
,
Plymouth
's
first
coal
mine
)
achieved
national
fame
as
a
kind
of
tourist
attraction
.

In
0000
,
a
writer
from
Wilkes-Barre
posted
a
notice
in
the
Connecticut
Mirror
,
writing
,
"
among
the
curiosities
of
our
county
(
and
we
have
a
few
)
are
Smith
's
Coal
Mines
,
situated
in
Plymouth
township
in
this
county
...
it
sends
a
sudden
twinge
through
a
fellow
,
say
,
to
think
himself
walking
under
a
mountain
fifty
feet
through
,
with
only
here
and
there
a
pillar
to
support
it
...
those
who
feel
desirous
of
knowing
more
about
this
matter
,
must
do
as
many
others
have
done
-
go
and
see
for
themselves
.
"

Beginning
with
the
fifty
tons
of
coal
shipped
by
Abijah
Smith
in
0000
,
Plymouth
's
and
the
Wyoming
Valley
's
coal
industry
grew
steadily
.

In
0000
,
the
Baltimore
Patriot
reported
that
"
...
a
greater
quantity
of
Anthracite
Coal
has
been
sent
down
the
Susquehanna
this
Spring
than
in
any
former
season
.

The
Baltimore
Company
have
sent
three
thousand
tons
,
and
from
other
mines
about
seven
thousand
tons
were
dispatched
,
making
an
aggregate
of
ten
thousand
tons
.
"

The
North
Branch
CanalAs
late
as
the
0000s
,
whenever
high
water
allowed
,
coal
from
Wyoming
Valley
's
coal
mines
was
shipped
down
the
Susquehanna
River
on
wooden
arks
.

But
by
the
end
of
0000
,
canal
boats
began
to
replace
arks
as
the
preferred
method
of
transporting
coal
and
other
goods
to
market
.

In
0000
,
the
Pennsylvania
Board
of
Canal
Commissioners
engaged
John
Bennett
to
survey
the
route
of
a
new
canal
,
to
be
called
the
North
Branch
Canal
,
to
run
alongside
the
north
branch
(
the
main
branch
)
of
the
Susquehanna
River
from
Northumberland
to
the
New
York
border
.

In
early
0000
,
Bennet
reported
that
the
canal
was
feasible
,
and
in
0000
,
the
state
legislature
authorized
funds
for
construction
.

Charles
T.
Whippo
,
who
had
worked
on
the
construction
of
the
Erie
Canal
,
was
engaged
to
survey
the
route
and
supervise
construction
.

The
southern
portion
of
the
canal
,
as
built
,
ran
for
along
the
west
side
of
the
river
,
from
Northumberland
to
West
Nanticoke
,
where
a
dam
at
Nanticoke
Falls
was
built
to
divert
water
from
the
river
into
the
canal
.

The
work
was
generally
complete
by
the
fall
of
0000
.

The
first
load
of
coal
shipped
from
the
Wyoming
Valley
reached
Berwick
in
October
.

The
canal
was
a
boon
to
Plymouth
's
coal
operators
,
who
in
0000
included
John
Smith
,
Freeman
Thomas
,
Henderson
Gaylord
and
Thomas
Borbidge
,
and
encouraged
others
to
open
mines
,
such
as
Jameson
Harvey
and
Jacob
Gould
.

Smith
's
teamsters
led
teams
of
horses
deep
into
his
mine
,
turned
the
team
,
loaded
the
wagon
and
then
drove
the
team
to
the
river
bank
to
load
the
coal
into
canal
boats
.

Gaylord
,
whose
mine
was
at
the
base
of
Welsh
Hill
,
improved
on
this
method
and
built
a
gravity
railroad
that
ran
along
what
is
now
Walnut
Street
,
down
what
is
now
Gaylord
Avenue
,
to
his
wharf
on
the
river
.

A
similar
road
,
called
the
Swetland
Railroad
,
was
built
from
mines
in
Poke
Hollow
down
a
route
which
later
became
Washington
Avenue
,
across
Bull
Run
to
another
wharf
on
the
river
.

Freeman
Thomas
built
a
railroad
from
his
Grand
Tunnel
mine
to
a
chutehouse
along
the
river
near
the
entrance
to
the
canal
.

The
early
coal
mines
in
Plymouth
supported
an
ancillary
industry
,
boat
building
.

The
arks
used
to
transport
goods
on
the
river
were
built
in
a
basin
where
Wadham
's
Creek
entered
the
river
.

After
the
canal
was
built
,
the
arks
began
to
be
replaced
by
flat-bottomed
canal
boats
,
built
in
the
same
basin
with
a
distinctive
design
,
known
as
"
Shawnee
boats
.
"

Many
of
the
town
's
young
men
became
boatmen
and
were
well
known
along
the
length
of
the
canal
for
their
distinctive
call
,
"
Shawnee
against
the
World
.
"

George
Bedford
,
writing
in
0000
,
evoked
the
antebellum
charm
and
character
of
Plymouth
in
the
0000s
:
There
was
at
that
time
no
evidence
in
sight
of
coal
mining
.

At
several
places
on
the
main
street
there
were
small
clusters
of
houses
,
but
all
else
was
highly
cultivated
farm
land
,
extending
from
well
up
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
to
the
river
’s
shore
...
Taking
it
all
in
,
there
was
no
more
beautiful
part
of
the
Wyoming
Valley
.

In
the
twilight
of
the
summer
evenings
we
were
wont
to
sit
at
the
front
of
the
old
home
and
hear
the
pleasant
and
oft
recurring
sound
of
the
boatman
’s
horn
miles
away
,
wafted
across
the
river
and
giving
signal
to
the
keeper
of
the
outlet
lock
[
at
West
Nanticoke
]
to
make
ready
for
the
passage
of
boats
in
and
out
of
the
canal
.

Alas
,
all
is
changed
!

Towering
coal
breaker
s
and
huge
culm
banks
are
marked
features
of
the
landscape
.

The
canal
and
its
locks
,
its
boats
and
its
boatmen
,
together
with
the
boatman
’s
horn
,
have
long
since
passed
away
.

Years
of
industrial
growth
(
0000-0000
)
The
Lackawanna
and
Bloomsburg
RailroadThe
Lackawanna
and
Bloomsburg
Railroad
was
incorporated
by
a
charter
from
the
Pennsylvania
state
legislature
on
April
0
,
0000
.

The
Board
of
Directors
of
the
railroad
included
two
Plymouth
native
sons
,
Henderson
Gaylord
and
William
C.
Reynolds
.

The
railroad
reached
Plymouth
by
0000
,
and
by
June
0000
,
all
of
the
railroad
,
from
Scranton
to
Northumberland
,
were
complete
.

In
0000
,
the
line
came
under
the
control
of
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
and
Western
Railroad
,
which
was
backed
by
powerful
New
York
financiers
,
and
which
operated
several
collieries
along
its
length
,
including
the
Avondale
Colliery
in
Plymouth
.

The
completion
of
the
Lackawanna
and
Bloomsburg
Railroad
connected
Plymouth
to
the
nation
's
growing
transportation
grid
,
making
it
easier
and
cheaper
for
mine
operators
to
ship
large
quantities
of
coal
to
distant
markets
.

The
railroad
's
arrival
led
to
the
rapid
transformation
of
the
small
agricultural
village
into
a
major
supplier
of
anthracite
coal
.

Small
mining
operations
founded
by
local
residents
gave
way
to
large
,
highly
capitalized
collieries
,
capable
of
reaching
coal
veins
deep
underground
.

These
large
operations
attracted
foreign
labor
,
first
from
the
British
Isles
,
and
then
from
Eastern
Europe
.

Industrial
growth
brought
the
town
prosperity
,
which
in
turn
brought
amenities
like
a
central
water
system
,
gas
and
electrical
systems
,
paved
streets
,
sewers
,
elaborate
school
buildings
and
a
trolley
system
connecting
Plymouth
's
residents
to
other
towns
and
cities
in
the
Wyoming
Valley
.

On
the
other
hand
,
industrial
growth
had
disadvantages
,
including
strife
between
labor
and
management
,
and
wild
swings
in
the
economic
cycle
.

The
jobs
provided
by
the
coal
industry
came
with
the
constant
risk
of
death
or
injury
and
,
for
those
who
survived
,
chronic
health
problems
.

The
annals
of
Plymouth
's
history
include
a
long
list
of
mining
fatalities
as
well
as
one
of
the
nation
's
greatest
mine
disasters
.

The
First
National
BankThe
First
National
Bank
of
Plymouth
was
organized
on
December
00
,
0000
,
under
the
National
Banking
Law
of
0000
,
which
authorized
banks
to
handle
and
distribute
national
currency
.

The
bank
opened
its
doors
for
business
on
February
00
,
0000
,
and
was
granted
Federal
Certificate
No.
000
in
September
0000
.

The
enterprise
was
started
with
capital
of
$
000,000
.

The
bank
's
earliest
directors
included
the
heads
of
Plymouth
's
old
Yankee
families
.

Smith
,
Gaylord
,
Turner
,
Reynolds
,
Davenport
and
Harvey
were
represented
.

Notably
absent
was
the
Wadhams
family
.

The
directors
also
included
a
smattering
of
more
recently
arrived
men
,
such
as
the
Philadelphia
-
born
William
L.
Lance
,
and
the
Scotsman
,
Charles
Hutchison
.

But
whatever
their
family
background
,
all
of
the
directors
were
involved
in
the
coal
business
.

The
bank
was
formed
at
a
time
of
transition
for
the
coal
industry
,
when
the
town
's
independent
mine
operators
(
most
of
whom
were
directors
of
the
bank
)
were
handing
over
the
operation
of
their
mines
,
either
by
lease
or
by
sale
,
to
a
few
large
corporations
—
by
0000
,
the
Kingston
Coal
Co.
,
the
Delaware
&
Hudson
Canal
Co.
,
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
and
Western
Railroad
,
and
the
Lehigh
and
Wilkes-Barre
Coal
Co.
would
control
most
of
Plymouth
's
coal
mines
.

Initially
,
the
First
National
Bank
’s
directors
met
in
the
MacFarlane
Building
(
which
later
became
the
Stegmaier
brewery
,
which
in
turn
became
the
Golden
Quality
ice
cream
store
and
factory
)
.

In
July
0000
,
the
bank
moved
across
the
street
to
the
corner
of
Girard
and
Main
streets
and
for
the
next
fifty
years
operated
on
that
site
out
of
a
simple
Italianate
building
which
it
shared
with
a
separate
residence
.

The
boundaries
of
the

extended
from
the
line
of
the
No.

Lance
Coal
Breaker
on
the
east
to
Driscoll
Street
on
the
west
,
about
a
mile
and
a
half
;
and
from
the
river
on
the
south
to
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
on
the
north
.

When
first
created
,
the
borough
was
divided
into
two
wards
,
east
and
west
,
the
dividing
line
being
Academy
Street
.

Later
,
these
two
wards
were
sub-divided
into
additional
wards
.

After
incorporation
,
the
borough
elections
were
held
in
the
Old
Academy
where
the
township
elections
had
previously
been
held
.

The
first
borough
election
was
held
in
May
0000
.

Oliver
Davenport
was
judge
of
the
election
,
