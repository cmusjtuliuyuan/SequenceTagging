quickly
cross
pollinated
to
create
a
new
potato
,
which
he
named
Neshannock
,
after
a
small
creek
nearby
.

This
new
type
of
potato
quickly

popular
among
local
farmers
for
its
productivity

better
quality
in
taste
.

nineteenth
century
,
the
Neshannock
became
the
standard
commercial
potato
of

History
Ohioville
Township
was
formed
in
0000
from
parts
of
South
Beaver
Township
.

The
region
had
,
in
years
past
,
been
home
to
numerous
tribes
of
Native
Americans
,
most
notably
the
Archaic
and
Woodland
Epoch
,
of
Iroquionian
extraction
.

Prior
to
William
Penn
's
arrival
in
the
region
,
the
Iroquios
tribe
of
the
Five
Nations
used
the
region
for
hunting
.

Originally
known
as
Ohio
Township
,
the
borough
was
once
home
to
a
ferry
run
by
Maryland
native
Thomas
Smith
.

This
ferry
transported
passengers
from
the
north
side
of
the
Ohio
to
the
south
,
and
back
again
.

Near
the
ferry
,
a
spring
of
"
bituminous
oil
"
arose
that
would
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
township
's
development
.

At
one
time
there
were
also
several
Indian
pictographs
.

(
These
are
currently
underwater

)

Early
communities
Blackhawk
village
was
a
small
community
on
the
South
Beaver
Township
line
.

Its
first
post
office
was
established
sometime
after
0000
.

Even
earlier
,
the
New
Salem
United
Presbyterian
Church
was
established
circa
0000
,
around
the
same
time
as
Big
Beaver
's
Mount
Pleasant
Church
.

In
0000
,
Four
Mile
United
Presbyterian
Church
was
founded
.

Located
on
Tuscarawas
Road
(
whose
name
derives
from
the
old
Tuscarora
hunting
trail
)
,
the
church
was
originally
named
Four
Mile
Square
Church
.

In
0000
,
Ohioville
lost
some
of
its
territory
to
Brighton
Township
.

With
the
establishment
of
Glasgow
Borough
(
0000
)
and
Industry
Township
(
0000
)
,
and
Midland
(
0000
)
even
more
land
was
lost
.

Finally
,
in
0000
,
Ohio
Township
was
incorporated
as
Ohioville
Borough
.

West
Mayfield
is
a
borough
in
Beaver
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

At
the
founding
of
Beaver
County
,
the
Borough
of
West
Mayfleld
was
part
of
South
Beaver
Township
.

In
0000
,
it
came
within
Chippewa
's
bounds
upon
founding
of
that
township
.

In
0000
,
the
land
passed
into
the
newly-formed
White
Township
.

Around
this
time
,
the
site
known
as
Mayfield
was
little
more
than
a
station
on
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

The
station
stop
took
its
name
from
a
farm
up
on
the
hill
known
as
Mayfield
Cottage
.

West
Mayfield
,
then
,
was
the
area
west
of
the
station
stop
.

It
had
areas
too
.

The
Oakville
area
centered
around
the
present
Rock
Avenue
just
southwest
of
00
th
Street
.

Another
section
was
known
as
West
Park
.

These
names
survive
in
the
vicinity
today
in
the
name
for
a
school
,
West
Park
;
the
name
of
a
part
of
Route
000
,
Oakville
Road
;
and
the
name
of
the
community
,
West
Mayfield
.

Its
increasing
industrialization
and
the
need
for
more
and
better
schools
led
to
the
split
from
White
Township
and
its
incorporation
in
0000
.

Most
of
West
Mayfield
lies
along
the
north
and
south
of
a
long
,
steep
hill
called
00
th
Street
,
part
of
Route
000
.

To
the
south
is
a
hollow
which
was
once
part
of
the
Harbison
farm
and
coal
yards
.

Before
the
industries
began
,
there
were
only
the
farmlands
of
the
Whites
,
Edwards
,
Harbisons
,
Ridings
,
Waggoners
and
Schuttes
,
about
a
dozen
houses
and
a
little
schoolhouse
.

Thirty-seventh
Street
was
a
narrow
dirt
road
traveled
by
a
few
buggies
and
wagons
in
the
summer
and
in
the
winter
by
a
similar
number
of
sleds
and
sleighs
.

When
it
snowed
,
the
young
people
of
College
Hill
and
Geneva
College
had
bobsled
parties
on
the
road
.

Most
of
the
names
we
have
found
among
the
early
settlers
were
English
.

John
White
,
credited
with
being
the
first
settler
,
came
to
this
area
about
0000-00
under
the
"
Settlement
and
Improvement
Act
of
0000
.
"

He
came
from
County
Antrim
,
Ireland
.

John
Edwards
appears
to
have
bought
land
from
John
White
on
00th
Street
hill
,
now
part
of
West
Mayfield
.

He
was
born
in
Wales
and
came
to
this
area
sometime
after
0000
.

Other
prominent
names
in
West
Mayfleld
which
appear
to
be
English
,
Irish
or
Scotch
are
Scranton
,
Patterson
,
Portman
,
Calhoun
,
Ridings
,
Garvin
,
and
Goe
,
Schutte
and
Gumph
are
evidently
German
names
.

Rouzer
,
Keller
,
Ohnsman
,
Smith
,
McConnels
,
Patterson
and
Ridings
were
instrumental
in
forming
the
charter
for
the
township
as
it
broke
away
from
White
Township
.

The
Edwards
School
,
a
one-room
red
brick
structure
,
was
built
about
0000
on
land
donated
by
the
Edwards
family
.

John
Edwards
had
come
to
Pittsburgh
from
Wales
when
he
was
a
young
boy
.

He
worked
on
the
canal
along
the
Beaver
River
.

He
worked
in
the
gold
fields
of
California
for
a
year
and
returned
to
buy
a
farm
on
00th
Street
hill
.

The
Edwards
School
building
also
served
as
a
community
meeting
house
and
as
an
auditorium
for
lectures
and
other
programs
.

At
the
end
of
each
school
year
it
hosted
the
annual
picnic
for
the
school
children
and
their
families
.

The
Edwards
home
was
a
welcome
stop
for
sledders
to
share
warmth
,
refreshments
and
hospitality
.

The
information
seems
to
indicate
that
the
Edwards
School
had
replaced
the
White
Schoolhouse
since
it
was
,
in
the
0000
's
,
"
the
only
school
for
miles
around
.
"

It
served
the
area
for
many
years
.

A
News-Tribune
article
of
August
00
,
0000
,
announced
that
forty
pupils
were
expected
to
take
up
their
studies
in
the
Edwards
School
under
Miss
Leiper
on
September
0
,
the
opening
day
of
school
.

The
school
administration
was
still
under
White
Township
,
even
though
they
had
split
away
the
previous
year
,
according
to
the
News-Tribune
item
.

That
year
,
0000
,
the
three
teachers
at
the
West
Park
building
were
Mr.
Balph
,
and
the
Misses
Anna
Birnnisser
and
Florence
Garvin
,
with
the
enrollment
expected
to
be
between
000
and
000
.

The
West
Park
building
was
begun
in
0000
with
four
classrooms
.

A
News-Tribune
article
of
December
00
,
0000
,
announced
the
laying
of
the
cornerstone
for
the
new
West
Mayfield
School
(
to
be
named
Liberty
School
)
.

It
would
house
grades
0-0
,
and
West
Park
School
grades
0-0
.

It
is
presumed
that
the
Edwards
School
continued
in
use
as
a
Community
Building
for
a
time
,
since
the
Volunteer
Fire
Department
used
it
as
a
meeting
place
until
they
were
able
to
use
the
borough
building
.

A
two-story
and
partial
basement
addition
to
the
West
Park
School
was
completed
in
0000
.

Ten
years
later
,
in
the
fall
of
0000
,
a
one-story
addition
was
occupied
,
and
the
Liberty
School
was
no
longer
required
for
classrooms
.

It
has
become
the
West
Mayfield
Municipal
Building
.

The
enrollment
at
West
Park
has
declined
from
a
projected
000
,
in
the
Long
Range
Developmental
Program
of
the
Blackhawk
District
,
(
0000
)
,
to
about
000
for
the
0000-00
school
year
.

Previously
,
secondary
education
was
available
in
the
Beaver
Falls
schools
;
when
the
borough
became
a
part
of
the
Highland
jointure
,
students
could
attend
the
Highland
Junior
High
and
Northwestern
High
School
,
or
they
could
choose
to
go
to
Beaver
Falls
.

Since
the
borough
is
now
a
part
of
Blackhawk
School
District
,
students
continue
in
Middle
School
at
Highland
and
attend
the
four-year
Blackhawk
High
School
on
Blackhawk
Road
.

St.
Philomena
Catholic
Church
serves
the
West
Mayfield
community
,
though
it
is
located
just
outside
the
borough
boundaries
.

It
has
a
parish
school
,
begun
in
0000
.

One
grade
was
added
each
year
until
eight
grades
were
provided
in
September
of
0000
.

Present
enrollment
is
about
000
,
and
many
of
the
students
come
from
the
community
of
West
Mayrfield
.

A
Christian
School
was
established
in
West
Mayfield
in
0000
.

It
has
grades
K-00
and
an
enrollment
of
about
00
.

It
is
housed
in
the
West
Mayfleld
Community
Church
,
now
listed
in
the
phone
book
as
the
West
Mayfleld
Bible
Baptist
Church
.

The
congregation
began
from
the
need
for
Christian
teaching
for
children
in
the
West
Mayfield
Housing
Project
in
0000
.

From
a
group
of
children
in
Sunday
School
classes
in
the
community
building
of
the
project
,
the
attendance
grew
,
and
a
congregation
formed
which
was
known
as
the
West
Mayfleld
Reformed
Presbyterian
Mission
.

They
separated
from
the
affiliation
with
the
Reformed
Presbyterian
denomination
and
were
chartered
in
0000
as
the
West
Mayfleld
Community
Church
.

They
began
their
building
in
0000
on
property
located
on
lower
High
Street
.

The
Church
of
the
Living
Christ
is
located
on
Rock
Avenue
near
00th
Street
.

It
is
a
small
chapel
,
built
here
in
0000
,
in
the
Oakville
area
,
to
conduct
a
Mission
Sabbath
school
.

A
permanent
Christian
Association
,
under
the
College
Hill
Reformed
Church
,
was
formed
for
this
congregation
.

It
continued
until
about
fifteen
years
ago
when
Ken
Engle
purchased
the
building
from
the
College
Hill
Reformed
Church
for
the
purpose
of
holding
Boy
Scout
meetings
.

It
served
the
Boy
Scouts
for
ten
years
until
the
present
congregation
purchased
the
chapel
from
Mr.
Engle
.

They
have
held
services
here
for
the
past
five
years
.

Early
industries
in
the
area
included
a
scale
works
and
a
key
works
,
and
coal
was
mined
in
Harbison
Hollow
.

Large
scale
industrial
development
began
in
0000
with
the
move
into
the
present
West
Mayfield
of
a
tube
making
industry
,
now
Babcock
and
Wilcox
Company
,
Tubular
Products
Division
.

Other
manufacturers
followed
;
present
ones
include
Mayfleld
Foundry
,
maker
of
castings
for
the
local
mills
and
manufacturer
of
heritage
articles
of
early
American
Colonial
days
,
and
Standard
Steel
Specialty
Company
,
maker
of
elevator
guides
and
other
products
.

As
the
new
tube
mill
was
built
,
there
was
a
need
for
homes
and
workmen
and
their
families
,
so
the
farms
gradually
became
subdivisions
.

As
the
plant
expanded
,
more
and
more
homes
were
needed
.

It
is
a
fairly
densely
populated
area
,
as
contrasted
with
Chippewa
,
Darlington
,
or
South
Beaver
Township
.

West
Mayfleld
probably
has
more
families
of
different
ethnic
backgrounds
than
any
other
areas
as
well
.

As
industrial
needs
increased
,
people
from
many
walks
of
life
sought
employment
in
the
Borough
.

It
had
the
highest
proportion
of
rentals
in
the
Blackhawk
District
in
0000
,
but
with
the
increasing
number
of
apartments
in
both
Chippewa
and
Patterson
and
the
increase
in
new
homes
built
in
West
Mayfield
,
the
percentage
has
probably
changed
in
the
past
ten
years
.

The
area
is
.00
square
miles
,
and
it
has
a
population
of
about
0,000
.

West
Mayfield
is
fairly
close-knit
,
in
terms
of
community
spirit
.

They
have
an
active
Volunteer
Fire
Department
,
and
the
school
has
enjoyed
the
support
of
a
fine
Parent-Teacher
Organization
.

The
P.T.O.
has
contributed
much
to
the
library
,
school
equipment
and
furnishings
,
school
programs
and
activities
,
including
field
trips
.

Most
of
the
youngsters
participate
in
various
Little
League
ball
clubs
with
much
support
from
the
community
.

The
"
Hollow
"
is
West
Mayfleld
's
main
recreational
facility
.

It
is
the
community
park
in
Harbison
Hollow
.

An
extensive
flat
area
features
three
ball
fields
,
basketball
and
tennis
courts
,
picnic
shelters
and
playground
equipment
.

It
is
the
site
of
the
annual
school
picnic
.

Teachers
and
children
walk
to
the
park
.

Bordered
by
the
wooded
hillsides
,
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
way
it
might
have
been
at
the
Edwards
School
a
hundred
years
ago
.

,
Harrisburg
and
000
miles
east
of
the
city
of
Pittsburgh
.

It
is
the
county
seat
of
Bedford
County
.

Bedford
was
established
in
the
mid-00th
century
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

History
Originally
called
Raystown
,
Bedford
was
settled
about
0000
and
laid
out
in
0000
.

Bedford
was
incorporated
on
March
00
,
0000
.

For
many
years
it
was
an
important
frontier
military
post
.

The
Espy
House
in
Bedford
is
notable
for
having
been
the
headquarters
of
George
Washington
and
his
force
of
00,000
while
putting
down
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
in
0000
,
which
had
started
around
the
Jean
Bonnet
Tavern
.

In
0000
the
British
Army
came
to
Raystown
to
set
up
a
fort
.

The
fort
was
named
Fort
Bedford
,
for
the
politically
powerful
Duke
of
Bedford
in
England
.

Some
believe
this
is
how
the
town
later
got
its
name
.

Fort
Bedford
was
built
as
one
of
the
many
British
Army
stepping
stones
through
the
state
leading
to
the
forks
of
the
Ohio
River
;
the
other
side
of
the
forks
was
dominated
by
Indians
.

The
British
used
the
fort
to
drive
out
the
French
to
ensure
the
new
continent
would
be
English-speaking
.

The
fort
was
later
a
safe
house
for
settlers
escaping
Indian
raids
.

Fort
Bedford
was
“
liberated
”
ten
years
before
the
Revolution
by
American
rebels
,
James
Smith
's
Black
Boys
,
and
was
the
first
fort
taken
from
the
British
.

The
fort
later
collapsed
and
was
reconstructed
in
0000
.

George
Washington
marched
his
army
to
Bedford
in
0000
to
subdue
the
Whiskey
Rebellion
.

There
was
much
more
at
stake
than
quieting
the
uprising
of
rebels
angered
by
a
tax
on
whiskey
;
Washington
felt
the
constitution
itself
was
at
risk
.

The
rebellion
mainly
consisted
of
farmers
who
learned
they
could
earn
more
selling
whiskey
instead
of
grain
.

The
Rebellion
spread
fast
and
when
it
reached
Pittsburgh
they
almost
burnt
the
city
to
the
ground
.

Anarchy
was
on
its
way
;
the
British
and
French
watched
every
move
hoping
they
could
come
back
and
take
over
.

Washington
knew
he
had
to
act
and
make
a
statement
;
the
laws
of
America
would
be
obeyed
.

00,000
militiamen
were
called
to
Bedford
leaving
the
rebels
without
many
choices
.

One
historian
later
stated
,
“
It
was
at
Bedford
that
the
new
federal
government
was
finally
to
establish
itself
as
sovereign
in
its
own
time
and
place
.

Bedford
,
at
one
time
,
was
famous
for
its
medicinal
springs
.

There
is
a
mineral
spring
,
a
chalybeate
spring
,
a
limestone
spring
,
a
sulfur
spring
and
two
sweet
spring
s.
In
the
year
0000
,
a
mechanic
from
Bedford
,
Jacob
Fletcher
,
drank
some
of
the
water
.

The
rheumatic
pains
and
ulcers
he
had
been
suffering
from
troubled
him
less
that
night
.

From
then
on
he
often
drank
from
the
spring
and
soaked
his
limbs
in
the
water
.

In
a
few
weeks
he
was
entirely
cured
.

News
spread
and
the
“
healing
springs
”
quickly
became
popular
.

The
finding
of
the
curative
springs
led
Dr.
John
Anderson
to
purchase
the
nearby
land
and
build
a
spa
in
0000
.

Due
to
the
lack
of
medicines
in
that
time
,
people
from
great
distances
flocked
to
the
hotel
in
search
of
a
cure
for
their
illness
.

The
Bedford
Springs
Hotel
was
the
first
place
in
America
to
have
an
Olympic
sized
pool
.

President
James
Buchanan
also
made
it
his
“
summer
White
House
”
.

While
Buchanan
was
there
the
first
trans-Atlantic
cable
message
was
sent
to
his
room
from
Queen
Victoria
on
August
00
,
0000
.

The
hotel
,
in
0000
,
also
housed
the
only
Supreme
Court
hearing
ever
to
be
held
outside
of
the
capital
.

Chalybeate
Springs
Hotel
,
along
with
the
nearby
Bedford
Springs
Hotel
,
were
popular
resorts
during
the
00th
century
among
the
wealthy
.

President
James
Buchanan
used
Bedford
Springs
as
his
summer
White
House
.

Other
notable
visitors
to
Bedford
Springs
included
William
Henry
Harrison
,
James
Polk
,
Zachary
Taylor
,
and
Thaddeus
Stevens
.

Rutherford
B.
Hayes
,
and
Benjamin
Harrison
visited
Chalybeate
Springs
Hotel
,
as
did
many
other
notable
people

several
thousand
people
.

Officially
founded
in
0000
by
James
Saxton
,
Saxton
has
been
home
to
people
for
many
years
.

Though
settlers
had
been
in
the
area
for
over
000
years
prior
.

Before
Anglos

camped
along
the
river
.

Saxton
was
the
home
of
the
Huntingdon

Broad
Top
Railroad
(
H&BT
)
.

For
almost
000
years
it
shipped
coal
from
Saxton
to
places
like
Bedford
,
Huntingdon
and
Everett
.

From
there
it
went
to
Pittsburgh
or
some
other
major
city
.

The
railroad
was
the
life
blood
of
the
town
,
and
the
Saxton
grew
up
around
it
.

Main
Street
used
to
run
right
along
a
railroad
right-of-way
.

Thousands
of
peopled
moved
to
the
area
to
work
on
or
for
the
railroad
.

The
region
's
rich
coal
fields
kept
the
railroad
running
for
nearly
000
years
.

In

heyday
Saxton
had
a
bowling
alley
,
a
toy
factory
,

candy
factory
,
a
coal
power
plant
,
dozens
of
shops
and
businesses
,

Bottling
factory

industries
included
a
pig
iron
furnace
,
coke
ovens
,
a
tannery
,

the
railroad
shut
down
,
and
much
of
what

left
has
been
either
torn
down
of
has
fallen
down

Nuclear
Generating
Station
,
the
nation
's
0th
nuclear
power
plant
,
which

History
Schellsburg
was
so
named
after
John
Schell
who
settled
and
founded
this
community
.

John
Schell
's
grandfather
Michael
Schell
,
the
progenitor
of
this
branch
of
the
Schell
family
in
America
,
first
arrived
in
Philadelphia
from
the
Palatinate
by
way
of
Rotterdam
in
0000
,
after
which
more
family
members
arrived
in
0000
and
again
in
0000
.

In
0000
when
he
returned
with
other
members
of
his
family
,
Michael
Schell
purchased
a
substantial
tract
of
land
where
he
settled
with
his
family
in
the
Perkiomen
Valley
northwest
of
Philadelphia
,
an
area
in
Upper
Hanover
Township
later
known
as
East
Greenville
,
in
what
was
then
Philadelphia
County
and
became
Montgomery
County
in
0000
.

The
adjoining
community
of
Hillegassville
was
named
after
its
founder
Johann
Frederick
Hillegass
.

His
granddaughter
Elizabeth
Barbara
Hillegass
married
John
Schell
,
Jr.
,
who
was
born
in
0000
at
the
family
homestead
granted
to
his
father
John
Schell
,
Sr.
,
the
youngest
son
of
Michael
Schell
who
died
in
0000
.

At
an
early
age
,
John
Schell
,
Jr.
became
possessed
of
considerable
means
after
his
patriotic
service
in
the
U.S.
Revolutionary
War
and
his
father
's
death
in
0000
.

For
many
years
he
traveled
extensively
on
business
through
Bedford
County
,
western
Pennsylvania
and
Kentucky
,
which
was
admitted
as
a
state
in
0000
.

He
was
impressed
by
the
climate
and
fertile
soil
in
Kentucky
,
decided
to
remove
there
and
select
land
to
establish
his
own
community
for
his
family
and
friends
.

In
the
spring
of
0000
,
John
Schell
and
his
family
,
consisting
of
his
wife
,
eight
young
children
and
his
widowed
mother
,
left
their
home
in
Montgomery
County
and
traveled
west
.

When
they
arrived
at
the
Ohio
River
,
he
realized
that
it
would
be
unsafe
for
his
family
to
traverse
the
river
by
boat
due
to
the
Indians
.

He
returned
through
Napier
Township
in
Bedford
County
and
decided
instead
to
settle
in
what
is
the
present
location
of
Schellsburg
.

On
May
0
,
0000
John
Schell
purchased
large
tracts
of
land
of
more
than
,
which
were
later
divided
into
farms
and
given
to
each
of
his
sons
with
an
equivalent
in
money
and
land
to
his
daughters
.

His
own
homestead
was
constructed
on
property
located
outside
the
town
of
Schellsburg
.

John
Schell
generously
donated
land
for
schools
,
churches
and
town
lots
and
granted
parcels
to
the
town
and
its
citizens
.

In
0000
he
laid
out
the
town
lots
,
developed
the
community
and
provided
impetus
for
construction
of
the
nearby
turnpike
as
its
first
president
.

After
he
settled
in
Bedford
County
,
relatives
and
neighbors
in
Montgomery
County
followed
and
settled
in
the
area
and
the
immediate
vicinity
.

Schellsburg
was
incorporated
as
the
second
borough
of

Derivation
of
the
name
"
Amity
"
In
the
"
History
of
Montgomery
County
"
the
author
records
the
settlement
of
some
Swedes
at
Douglassville
a
few
years
after
0000
and
the
connection
of
this
settlement
with
a
group
of
Germans
at
New
Hanover
.

A
road
was
laid
out
from
New
Hanover
to
Germantown
.

Along
these
roads
,
the
word
"
Amity
"
was
used
to
designate
a
locality
.

The
name
was
adopted
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
area
to
symbolize
their
relations
with
the
Indians
.

Although
Sweden
lost
the
colony
in
0000
,
the
Swedish
settlers
sent
a
letter
to
their
homeland
in
0000
asking
for
ministers
and
religious
books
.

In
this
letter
they
stated
,
"
We
live
in
great
amity
with
the
Indians
,
who
have
not
done
us
harm
for
many
years
.
"

From
this
incident
,
those
Swedish
settlers
who
migrated
up
the
Schuylkill
beyond
the
Manatawny
called
their
settlement
,
Amity
.

History
The
Borough
of
Bally
was
originally
called
Goshenhoppen
,
an
Indian
word
meaning
"
meeting
place
"
.

Mennonite
s
and
Catholics
settled
it
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Clergyman
Ulrich
Beidler
erected
the
first
house
of
worship
,
the
Mennonite
Church
in
0000
.

Father
Theodore
Schneider
,
a
Jesuit
priest
,
came
to
the
area
in
0000
and
established
what
would
be
just
the
third
Catholic
mission
church
in
the
00
original
colonies
.

On
land
received
from
the
Mennonite
community
,
Father
Schneider
built
St.
Paul
's
Chapel
in
0000
.

St.
Paul
's
is
now
known
as
the
Most
Blessed
Sacrament
Church
,
and
it
is
the
oldest
existing
Catholic
place
of
worship
in
Pennsylvania
and
the
fourth
oldest
Catholic
structure
in
the
thirteen
original
colonies
.

Later
in
0000
Father
Schneider
started
a
Catholic
school
at
the
mission
church
.

The
school
,
originally
called
St.
Aloysius
Academy
,
also
marked
the
beginning
of
Catholic
education
in
the
00
original
colonies
.

After
several
name
changes
,
it
is
currently
known
as
St.
Francis
Academy
,
and
is
the
oldest
currently
operating
co-educational
Catholic
school
in
the
nation
.

To

the
many
churches
in
the
town
(
as
there
were
also
several
other
churches
in
the
area
of
different
denominations
)
,
Goshenhoppen
was
renamed
Churchville
.

When
the
post
office
was
established
in
0000
,
it
was
named
Bally
in
honor
of
Father
Augustin
J.
Bally
,
a
Catholic
priest
and
spiritual
leader
.

Bally
was
incorporated
as
a

,
Bally
resident
Annie
Clemmer
Funk
,
a
Mennonite
missionary
to
India
,
died
during
the
sinking
of
the
RMS
Titanic
.

She
was
en
route
to
Bally
to
visit
her
ailing
mother
,
and
reportedly
gave
up
her
seat
in
a
lifeboat
to
another
passenger

and
by
Jefferson
Township
to

History
Before
European
settlers
arrived
in
the
Tulpehocken
Creek
valley
,
the
area
was
inhabited
by
the
Lenape
.

In
0000
,
thirty-three
Palatine
families
from
Schoharie
,
New
York
,
moved
to
the
confluences
of
the
Tulpehocken
and
Northkill
Creeks
.

By
0000
,
a
saw
and
grist
mill
was
located
three
and
a
half
miles
up
the
Tulpehocken
river
from
Bernville
.

In
0000
,
Stephanus
Umbenhauer
immigrated
from
Bern
,
Switzerland
,
and
purchased
from
Thomas
Penn
.

In
0000
,
Stephanus
'
grandson
,
Johann
Thomas
Umbenhauer
,
set
aside
to
be
divided
into
00
lots
.

On
00
August
0000
,
Peter
Bennethum
bought
the
first
six
lots
.

In
January
0000
,
the
town
was
named
Bernville
after
Stephanus
'
birthplace
.

The
first
house
was
built
by
Philip
Filbert
in
0000
.

In
0000
,
the
Union
Canal
was
completed
,
connecting
the
Susquehanna
and
Schuylkill
Rivers
.

Union
Canal
guard
lock
#

and
Lock
#

feet
is
located
at
the
southwest
corner
of
Bernville
Borough
,
near
where
Northkill
Creek
empties
into
Tulpehocken
Creek
.

An
historic
marker
on
Route
000
states
:
"
The
canal
,
at
this
point
,
followed
the
north
bank
of
the
Tulpehocken
.

A
dam
,
two
locks
,
and
a
mule
bridge
made
it
possible
for
boats
to
cross
Northkill
Creek
.

Nearby
were
grist
mills
,
a
lime
kiln
,
and
a
tannery
.
"

Due
to
the
proximity
of
the
Bernville
Locks
and
the
town
's
location
on
the
canal
,
Bernville
was
a
primary
and
prospering
canal
port
.

In
0000
,
the
village
of
Bernville
,
discontent
with
Penn
Township
’s
road
maintenance
and
community
services
,
incorporated

a
borough
.

The
borough
included
the
original
00
lots
,
most
of
which
measured
00
'
x
000
'
.

In
0000
,
the
Union
Canal
closed
.

With
no
canal
or
railroad
access
,
Bernville
withered
.

In
0000
,
Bernville
Borough
annexed
property
from
Penn
Township
at
both

Birdsboro
is
a

along
the
Schuylkill
River
in
Berks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
eight
miles
(
00
km
)
southeast
of
Reading
.

In
the
past
,
Birdsboro
was
noted
for
its
large
foundries
and
machine
shops
,
none
of
which
remain
in
operation
today
.

History
Birdsboro
was
named
for
ironmaker
William
Bird
,
who
established
a
forge
on
Hay
Creek
about
0000
.

His
son
Marcus
founded
Hopewell
Furnace
in
0000
,
which
was
the
largest
domestic
producer
of
iron
by
the
time
of
the
American
Revolution
.

The
Schuylkill
Canal
,
running
parallel
to
the
river
,
was
completed
in
0000
.

The
Philadelphia
and
Reading
Railroad
,
constructed
to
haul
anthracite
coal
,
was
completed
in
0000
.

Edward
and
George
Brooke
,
descendants
of
the
Birds
,
established
the
Birdsboro
Iron
Foundry
Company
(
0000
)
,
which
became
Birdsboro
Steel
Company
(
0000
)
.

The
principal
employer
for
000
years
,
the
steel
plant
closed
in
0000
,
following
a
lengthy
strike
.

The
borough
was
created
in
0000
,
from
sections
of
Union
and
Robeson
Townships
.

Its
population
increased
slowly
from
0,000
in
0000
,
to
0,000
in
0000
,
to
0,000
in
0000
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

In
0000
,
torrential
rains
over
a
period
of
several
days
caused
Hay
Creek
to
flood
Pennsylvania
Route
00
,
which
ran
through
the
borough
,
and
washed
out
several
bridges
.

After
many
years
of
discussion
between
local
and
state
officials
,
the
decision
was
finally
made
in
0000
that
the
bridges
should
not
be
rebuilt
.

Instead
,
the
former
road
connecting
Birdsboro
to
Robeson
Township
would
be
used
formally
as
a
nature
trail
,
as
it
had
been
informally
used
since
the
time
of
the
flood
.

In
December
0000
,
the
PA
00
designation
was
removed
from
this
stretch
of
road
.

Caernarvon
Township
is
a
township
in
Berks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
often
referred
to
as
Morgantown
,
the
township
's
largest
village
.

History
Caernarvon
is
a
Welsh
word
,
based
on
Caer
Yr
Arfon
-
"
Fort
(
Caer
)
on
the
River
(
Arfon
)
.
"

As
with
so
many
places
between
Philadelphia
and
Lancaster
,
the
area
was
first
settled
by
the
Welsh
.

To
them
,
the
rolling
hills
and
flowing
streams
reminded
them
of
their
beautiful
homeland
.

Caernarvon
Township
officially
dates
back
to
0000
,
the
same
year
Berks
County
was
established
.

There
is
some
confusion
as
to
the
origin
of
the
two
separate
Caernarvon
Townships
,
the
other
being
in
adjacent
Lancaster
County
.

Possibly
the
Townships
existed
as
one
before
the
county
lines
were
drawn
up
,
and
were
divided
to
accommodate
county
delineation
.

In
that
case
,
Township
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
0000
,
the
year
Lancaster
County
was
established
.

Attractions
History
The
name
Exeter
derives
from
the
town
of
Exeter
in
Devon
,
England
.

Numerous
other
places
have
also
been
given
the
name
Exeter
.

.

Origin
The
year
0000
is
believed
to
be
the
year
that
Berks
County
was
first
settled
.

Swedes
,
relocating
from
the
Philadelphia
and
Delaware
River
areas
,
settled
in
what
is
now
Amity
Township
.

In
0000
,
Isaac
DeTurk
moved
from
Esopus
,
New
York
to
Oley
and
began
a
settlement
there
.

It
was
a
mix
of
French
Huguenots
,
Germans
Quakers
and
Swiss
.

In
0000
,
they
petitioned
Philadelphia
County
for
Oley
to
become
its
own
Township
.

Exeter
Township
was
founded
December
0
,
0000
.

Previously
considered
part
of
Oley
Township
,
the
area
's
residents
petitioned
Philadelphia
County
to
become
a
separate
Township
six
months
after
the
establishment
of
Oley
.

The
petitioners
were
:
James
Boone
,
Benjamin
Boone
,
John
Boone
,
Squire
Boone
,
John
Hughes
,
William
Hughes
,
Francis
Yarnell
,
Peter
Yarnell
,
Michael
Warren
,
Peter
Huyett
,
Peter
Higo
,
Ezekiel
Mathias
,
Roger
Rogers
,
Joseph
Brown
,
Jacob
Vetter
,
and
Ellis
Hughes
.

These
petitioners
represent
our
Quaker
background
,
and
mostly
resided
in
the
area
around
the
Quaker
Meetinghouse
and
the
Monocacy
and
Limekiln
creeks
.

The
actual
name
of
the
Township
,
"
Exeter
"
,
is
generally
credited
to
the
George
Boone
family
.

That
family
was
from
a
town
called
Bradninch
,
England
,
just
outside
the
town
of
Exeter
.

Many
similarities
still
exist
between
the
two
cities
,
among
them
being
the
geography
,
soil
type
,
and
proximity
to
a
town
called
St.
Lawrence
.

Early
Residents
and
Communities
The
first
community
created
in
Exeter
was
called
Snydersville
.

It
was
populated
mostly
by
relatives
of
Hans
Schneider
from
the
Limekiln
area
.

It
contained
stores
,
schools
,
mills
,
and
even
a
hotel
.

Some
of
the
other
communities
that
developed
early
were
:
Baumstown
,
Black
Bear
,
Jacksonwald
,
St.
Lawrence
,
Stonersville
,
Stonetown
,
Lorane
,
and
Neversink
Station
.

George
Boone
and
family
were
one
of
the
most
influential
families
in
Exeter
.

At
one
time
they
owned
over
of
land
in
the
Township
and
were
among
the
petitioners
to
form
the
Township
.

Of
course
there
's
Daniel
Boone
as
well
,
who
we
know
grew
up
in
Exeter
and
went
on
to
become
famous
in
his
journeys
from
Kentucky
to
Missouri
.

Another
important
name
is
Lincoln
.

Abraham
Lincoln
's
great-great
grandfather
Mordecai
had
a
homestead
that
is
still
standing
along
Heister
's
creek
.

Growth
Through
the
00th
and
00th
centuries
,
Exeter
began
to
grow
due
to
the
need
for
connections
,
between
the
city
of
Reading
,
Oley
,
Boyertown
,
Birdsboro
,
and
King
of
Prussia
.

Trolley
lines
pushed
through
the
Township
,
in
the
Farming
Ridge
area
on
its
way
to
Boyertown
and
in
the
Reiffton
area
headed
towards
Birdsboro
.

Suburban
sprawl
got
going
post
WWII
to
boost
Exeter
's
population
and
the
Route
000
Expy
to
King
of
Prussia
was
completed
in
the
0000s
.

All
of
these
things
lead
us
up
to
what
Exeter
Township
is
today
,
a
thriving
community
of
over
00,000
people
.

School

's

was
named
after
a
creek
that
runs

peacefully
among

the
Quakers
began
to
move
west
.

Over
the

000
years
,
German
and
,
later
,
Scots
Welsh
and
Irish
settlers
purchased
and
moved
into
the
areas
that
the
Quakers
left
behind
.

First
on
the
scene
,
the
Germans
established
their
language
as
the
dominant
language
.

Deutsch
or
“
Dutch
”
became
the
primary
language
in
the
area
well
into
the
mid
0000s
,
when
one-room
schools
still
gave
instruction
in
German
and
English
as
a
second
language
was
part
of
the
curriculum
.

Farming
was
the
primary
means
of
living
well
into
the
0000s
until
roadways
,
housing
developments
and
commercial
and
industrial
development
began
to
take
off
in
the

A
talker
is
a
chat
system
that
people
use
to
talk
to
each
other
over
the
Internet
.

Dating
back
to
the
0000s
,
they
were
a
predecessor
of
instant
messaging
.

A
talker
is
a
communication
system
precursor
to
MMORPG
s
and
other
virtual
world
s
such
as
Second
Life
.

Talkers
are
a
form
of
online
virtual
world
s
in
which
multiple
user
s
are
connected
at
the
same
time
to
chat
in
real-time
.

People
log
into
the
talkers
remotely
(
usually
via
telnet
)
,
and
have
a
basic
text
interface
with
which
to
communicate
with
each
other
.

The
early
talkers
were
similar
to
MUD
s
with
most
of
the
complex
game
machinery
stripped
away
,
leaving
just
the
communication
level
commands
—
hence
the
name
"
talker
"
.

ew-too
was
,
in
fact
,
a
MUD
server
with
the
game
elements
removed
.

Most
talkers
are
free
and
based
on
open
source
software
.

Many
of
the
online
metaphor
s
used
on
talkers
,
such
as
"
rooms
"
and
"
residency
"
,
were
established
by
these
early
pioneering
services
and
remain
in
use
by
modern
0D
interfaces
such
as
Second
Life
.

History
of
talkers
Early
Internet
talkers
In
the
school
year
of
0000-0000
,
Mark
Jenks
and
Todd
Krause
,
two
students
at
Washington
High
School
in
Milwaukee
,
wrote
a
software
program
for
talking
among
a
group
of
people
.

They
used
the
PDP-00
at
the
Milwaukee
Public
Schools
(
MPS
)
central
office
.

After
searching
around
the
PDP-00
files
and
directories
,
Mark
found
the
PDP-00
program
talk
,
and
decided
that
they
could
do
better
.

The
system
had
approximately
00
000-0000
bit
per
second
modem
s
attached
to
it
,
with
a
single
phone
number
with
a
hunt
group
.

The
talk
program
was
named
TALK
and
was
written
to
handle
many
options
that
are
seen
in
IRC
today
:
tables
,
private
messages
,
actions
,
moderators
and
inviting
to
tables
.

Talker
hosting
In
0000
,
talker.com
was
formed
,
the
first
server
to
sell
space
for
talkers
,
later
giving
it
the
name
Dragonroost
.

The
server
had
up
to
00
+
talkers
on
it
at
one
time
,
during
the
mid-nineties
boom
of
talkers
.

A
number
of
other
hosts
started
up
as
alternative
hosting
companies
to
talker.com
.

Talker.com
ceased
hosting
any
other
talkers
besides
its
owners
'
on
September
00
,
0000
.

County
Court
to
create
a

proposed
borough

a
little
known
eatery

History
In
0000
,
Richard
and
Thomas
Penn
(
sons
of
William
Penn
the
founder
of
Pennsylvania
,
and
grandsons
of
Sir
William
Penn
for
whom
Pennsylvania
is
named
)
planned
the
town
of
Reading
with
Conrad
Weiser
.

Taking
its
name
from
the
town
of
Reading
in
England
in
honor
of
their
home
,
it
was
established
in
0000
.

Upon
the
creation
of
Berks
County
in
0000
the
town
became
the
county
seat
.

Susanna
Cox
was
tried
and
convicted
for
infanticide
in
Reading
in
0000
.

Her
case
attracted
tremendous
sympathy
;
00,000
viewers
came
to
view
her
hanging
,
swamping
the
0,000
inhabitants
.

As
a
result
of
her
trial
,
laws
were
changed
,
and
she
was
the
last
woman
executed
in
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
.

During
the
French
and
Indian
War
,
Reading
was
a
military
base
for
a
chain
of
forts
along
the
Blue
Mountain
.

Meanwhile
the
region
was
being
settled
by
emigrants
from
southern
and
western
Germany
.

The
Pennsylvanian
German
dialect
was
spoken
in
Reading
well
into
the
0000s
and
later
.

By
the
time
of
the
American
Revolution
,
the
area
's
iron
industry
had
a
total
production
which
exceeded
England
's
,
an
output
that
would
help
supply
George
Washington
's
troops
with
cannons
,
rifles
,
and
ammunition
in
the
Revolutionary
War
.

During
the
early
period
of
the
conflict
,
Reading
was
a
depot
again
for
military
supply
.

Hessian
prisoners
from
the
Battle
of
Trenton
were
also
detained
here
.

The
Philadelphia
and
Reading
Railroad
(
P&R
)
was
incorporated
in
0000
.

During
the
Long
Depression
following
the
Panic
of
0000
,
a
statewide
railroad
strike
in
0000
over
delayed
wages
led
to
a
violent
protest
and
clash
with
the
National
Guard
in
which
six
Reading
men
were
killed
.

After
over
a
century
of
prosperity
,
the
Reading
Company
was
forced
to
file
for
bankruptcy
protection
in
0000
.

The
bankruptcy
was
a
result
of
dwindling
coal
shipping
revenues
and
strict
government
regulations
that
denied
railroads
the
ability
to
set
competitive
prices
,
required
high
taxes
,
and
forced
the
railroads
to
continue
to
operate
money-losing
passenger
service
lines
.

On
April
0
,
0000
,
the
Reading
Company
sold
its
current
railroad
interests
to
the
newly
formed
Consolidated
Railroad
Corporation
(
Conrail
)
.

Early
in
the
00th
century
,
the
city
participated
in
the
burgeoning
automobile
and
motorcycle
industry
,
hosting
the
pioneer
brass
era
companies
,
Daniels
,
Duryea
and
Reading-Standard
.

In
0000
,
one
the
anchors
of
the
Battleship
Maine
was
delivered
from
the
Washington
Navy
Yard
to
City
Park
,
off
of
Perkiomen
Avenue
.

The
anchor
was
dedicated
during
a
ceremony
presided
over
by
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
,
who
was
then
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
.

Reading
was
home
to
several
movie
and
theater
palaces
in
the
early
00th
Century
.

The
Astor
,
Embassy
,
Loew
's
Colonial
,
and
Rajah
Shrine
Theater
were
grand
monuments
of
architecture
and
entertainment
.

Today
,
after
depression
,
recession
,
and
urban
renewal
,
the
Rajah
is
the
only
to
remain
.

The
Astor
Theater
was
demolished
in
0000
to
make
way
for
The
Sovereign
Center
.

Certain
steps
were
taken
to
retain
mementos
of
the
Astor
;
Including
its
ornate
Art
Deco
chandelier
and
gates
.

These
are
on
display
and
in
use
inside
the
arena
corridors
,
allowing
insight
into
the
ambiance
of
the
former
movie
house
.

In
0000
,
the
Rajah
was
purchased
from
the
Shriners
.

After
a
much
needed
restoration
,
it
was
renamed
the
Sovereign
Performing
Arts
Center
.

Reading
experienced
continuous
growth
until
the
0000s
,
when
its
population
reached
nearly
000,000
.

From
the
0000s
to
the
0000s
,
however
,
the
city
saw
a
sharp
downturn
in
prosperity
,
largely
owing
to
the
decline
of
the
heavy
industry
and
railroads
,
on
which
Reading
had
been
built
,
and
a
national
trend
of
urban
decline
.

One
of
the
city
's
grandest
landmarks
,
Stokesay
Castle
,
was
built
by
George
Baer
Hiester
in
0000
as
a
gift
for
his
bride
,
Anne
.

Unfortunately
,
Anne
did
not
care
for
the
replica
00th
century
English
Manor
House
and
rarely
stayed
there
.

Designed
by
architect
Frederick
Augustus
Muhlenberg
,
the
property
was
sold
in
0000
,
and
converted
to
a
restaurant
in
the
early
0000s
.

In
recent
years
Stokesay
and
its
pub
have
become
renown
for
fine
wine
and
dining
;
Partly
due
to
chef
Andrea
Heinly
,
of
Hell
's
Kitchen
fame
.

In
0000
,
Hurricane
Agnes
caused
extensive
flooding
in
the
city
,
not
the
last
time
the
lower
precincts
of
Reading
were
inundated
by
the
Schuylkill
River
as
a
similar
,
though
not
as
devastating
,
flood
occurred
during
June
0000
.

The
Reading
Glove
and
Mitten
Manufacturing
Company
founded
in
0000
,
just
outside
Reading
city
limits
,
in
West
Reading
and
Wyomissing
boroughs
changed
its
name
to
Vanity
Fair
in
0000
and
is
now
the
major
clothing
manufacturer
VF
Corp.
In
the
early
0000s
,
the
original
factories
were
developed
to
create
the
VF
Outlet
Village
,
the
first
outlet
mall
in
the
United
States
.

The
mall
is
so
successful
that
it
draws
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tourists
to
Reading
every
year
.

The
Mid-Atlantic
Air
Museum
is
a
membership-supported
museum
and
restoration
facility
located
at
Carl
A.
Spaatz
Field
.

The
museum
actively
displays
and
restores
historic
and
rare
war
aircraft
and
civilian
airliners
.

Most
notable
to
their
collection
is
a
Northrop
P-00
Black
Widow
under
active
restoration
since
its
recovery
from
Mount
Cyclops
,
New
Guinea
in
0000
.

Beginning
in
0000
,
the
museum
has
hosted
"
World
War
II
Weekend
Air
Show
"
,
scheduled
to
coincide
with
D-Day
.

On
display
are
period
wartime
aircraft
(
many
of
which
fly
throughout
the
show
)
vehicles
,
and
weapons
.

The
0000
census
showed
that
Reading
's
population
decline
had
ceased
.

This
was
attributed
to
an
influx
of
Hispanic
residents
from
New
York
,
as
well
as
from
the
extension
of
suburban
sprawl
from
Philadelphia
's
northwest
suburbs
.

Reading
has
its
share
of
obstacles
to
overcome
,
namely
crime
.

However
,
new
crime
fighting
strategies
appear
to
be
having
an
impact
,
as
in
0000
the
city
dropped
in
the
rankings
of
dangerous
cities
,
and
then
again
in
0000
.

In
December
0000
,
NBC
's
Today
show
featured
Reading
as
one
of
the
top
four
"
Up
and
Coming
Neighborhoods
"
in
the
United
States
as
showing
potential
for
a
real
estate
boom
.

The
interviewee
Barbara
Corcoran
chose
the
city
by
looking
for
areas
of
big
change
,
renovations
,
cleanups
of
parks
,
waterfronts
,
and
warehouses
.

Corcoran
also
noted
Reading
's
proximity
to
Philadelphia
,
New
York
,
and
other
cities
.

The
financial
crisis
of
0000
and
subsequent
nationwide
recession
stifled
optimism
;
in
November
0000
the
PBS
Newshour
reported
that
Reading
was
officially
the
poorest
city
in
the
nation
with
00
%
of
inhabitants
living
below
the
poverty
line

a
short

Rail
Passenger
trains
ran
between
Pottsville
,
Reading
,
Pottstown
and
Philadelphia
until
July
00
,
0000
,
when
transit
operator
SEPTA
curtailed
commuter
service
to
electrified
lines
.

Since
then
,
there
have
been
repeated
calls
for
the
resumption
of
the
sorely
needed
services
.

In
the
late
0000s
and
up
to
0000
,
SEPTA
,
in
cooperation
with
Reading-based
BARTA
funded
a
study
called
the
Schuylkill
Valley
Metro
which
included
plans
to
extend
both
sides
of
SEPTA
's
R0
passenger
line
to
Pottstown
,
Reading
,
and
Wyomissing
,
Pennsylvania
.

The
project
suffered
a
major
setback
when
it
was
rejected
by
the
Federal
Transit
Administration
New
Starts
program
,
which
cited
doubts
about
the
ridership
projections
and
financing
assumptions
used
by
the
study
.

With
the
recent
surge
in
gasoline
prices
and
ever-increasing
traffic
,
the
planning
commissions
of
Montgomery

have
teamed
to
study
the
feasibility
of
a
simple
diesel
shuttle
train
between

Shillington
is
a
borough
in
Berks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
with
a
population
of
0,000
at
the
0000
census
nestled
amongst
other
suburbs
outside
of
Reading
.

It
is
perhaps
best
known
as
the
place
where
author
John
Updike
lived
until
he
was
00
,
and
it
is
the
basis
for
the
town
of
Olinger
that
he
wrote
about
in
his
fiction
.

History
Shillington
began
in
0000
as
part
of
Cumru
Township
,
when
local
landowner
and
borough
namesake
Samuel
Shilling
sold
some
of
his
lots
for
residences
.

The
area
had
an
inn
,
originally
built
in
0000
,
called
the
Three
Mile
House
because
it
was
from
Reading
on
the
Lancaster
Pike
.

The
inn
was
a
popular
stop
for
farmers
going
to
the
city
's
markets
and
later
it
sat
near
a
horse
racing
track
built
by
Aaron
Einstein
in
0000
.

A
post
office
opened
in
Shillington
in
0000
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
the
Quarter
Session
Court
officially
incorporated
the
borough
of
Shillington
as
a
separate
municipality
from
Cumru
Township
with
a
population
of
000
.

Later
that
year
Shillington
elected
its
first
official
,
Adam
Rollman
,
as
chief
burgess
.

Borough
council
meetings
were
held
in
various
locations
over
the
years
until
the
present
town
hall
was
completed
in
0000
.

Much
of
the
borough
's
present
land
was
occupied
by
Angelica
Farm
which
would
be
established
as
an
almshouse
,
or
poorhouse
,
in
0000
.

The
alms
house
was
replaced
by
Bern
Township
's
Berks
Heim
in
0000
.

The
buildings
of
the
Governor
Mifflin
School
District
now
occupy
most
of
land
that
was
once
part
of
the
almshouse
.

Today
,
the
most
notable
visible
remnant
of
the
poorhouse
is
a
stone
wall
that
is
within
short
walking
distance
down
the
road
from
John
Updike
's
old
home
.

Updike
's
first
novel
,
The
Poorhouse
Fair
,
is
set
in
a
fictional
building
based
on
Shillington
's
poorhouse
.

Angelica
Farm
was
also
the
historical
home
of
Thomas
Mifflin
,
the
first
governor
of
Pennsylvania
.

He
was
also
00th
President
of
the
Continental
Congress
.

Geography
Wyomissing
is
located
at
(
00.000000
,
-00.000000
)
.

According
to
the
United
States

area
of
,
of
which
,
of
it
is
land
and

.

History
0000
to
0000
The
original
inhabitants
of
Wyomissing
were
Lenape
(
Delaware
)
Native
Americans
who
lived
along
the
banks
of
the
Wyomissing
Creek
.

The
name
"
Wyomissing
"
is
from
the
Delaware
language
,
meaning
"
the
land
of
flats
"
.

Much
of
Berks
County
was
transferred
from
the
Native
Americans
to
William
Penn
in
0000
.

Title
to
the
land
that
much
of
Wyomissing
is
built
upon
was
in
two
parcels
,
an
eastern
tract
and
a
western
tract
,
which
were
divided
by
a
northwesterly
line
in
the
vicinity
of
Lake
Avenue
.

One
of
the
earliest
industries
in
the
area
was
the
Evans
Grist
Mill
.

This
building
still
stands
at
the
corner
of
Old
Mill
Road
and
Old
Wyomissing
Road
.

In
0000
present
day
Wyomissing
began
to
take
form
when
Thomas
P.
Merritt
(
a
Reading
lumber
dealer
)
acquired
six
hundred
acres
.

Albert
Thalheimer
,
David
H.
Keiser
,
Marthias
Mengel
,
and
Levi
Walter
Mengel
joined
Thomas
R.
Merrit
in
organizing
the
Reading
Suburban
Real
Estate
Company
.

Shortly
afterwards
Wyomissing
Industries
,
manufacturer
of
textile
machinery
,
was
established
by
the
firm
of
Thun
&
Janssen
along
the
Reading
Railroad
just
west
of
Van
Reed
Road
(
today
named
Park
Road
)
.

This
spurred
development
and
soon
there
were
many
developers
working
to
build
Wyomissing
.

In
0000
and
0000
,
Thun
and
Janssen
called
town
meetings
to
discuss
setting
up
a
Borough
government
.

Eventually
petitions
were
filed
with
the
courts
for
the
establishment
of
a
Borough
,
signed
by
00
resident
property
owners
and
00
non-resident
property
owners
.

On
July
0
,
0000
,
the
court
issued
the
final
decree
of
the
incorporation
of
the
Borough
of
Wyomissing
.

0000
to
present
Between
0000
and
the
0000s
,
several
additional
tracts
of
land
were
annexed
to
the
Borough
from
both
Spring
and
Cumru
Townships
.

However
0000-0000
saw
the
largest
annexation
,
in
the
addition
of
the
area
north
of
the
railroad
tracts
known
as
Berkshire
Heights
.

This
drastically
changed
the
Borough
map
.

From
that
point
forward
,
the
Borough
has
changed
from
farmland
to
a
large
residential
and
commercial
community
.

The
last
farmland
worked
in
the
Borough
was
part
of
the
Hartman
Farm
at
the
intersection
of
Woodland
and
Papermill
Roads
.

This
land
was
sold
into
commercial
development
in
the
early
0000s
.

This
includes
the
area
now
called
"
Woodmill
Commons
,
"
where
Toys
R
Us
,
Old
Navy
and
other
businesses
now
are
located
.

In
0000
,
Wyomissing
merged
with
its
smaller
neighbor
,
Wyomissing
Hills
.

Economy
Wyomissing
is
a
thriving
commercial
office
and
retail
center
,
in
large
part
due
to
its
proximity
to
Reading
.

The
Berkshire
Mall
is
located
in
Wyomissing
along
with
several
other
large
shopping
centers
with
their
retail
giants
and
restaurants
.

As
crime
soared
in
Reading
throughout
the
0000s
,
companies
and
corporations
relocated
from
the
city
to
newer
,
Class
A
office
space
in
the
borough
.

In
addition
to
a
suburban
layout
,
the
greater
Wyomissing
area
is
at
the
crossroads
of
U.S.
Routes
000
and
000
,
providing
immediate
highway
access
to
the
rest
of
the
greater
Philadelphia
and
Berks
County
Region
.

Several
large
corporations
are
headquartered
in
Wyomissing
,
including
,
Penn
National
Gaming
,
the
second
largest
gaming
company
in
the
U.S.
,
Boscov

Inc.
,
currently
the
largest
family-owned
department
store
chain
in
the
U.S.
,
Carpenter
Technology
Corp.
,
and
Sovereign
Bank
.

UGI
Corp.
and
VF
Corp.
have
major
operations
in
the
borough
.

Wyomissing
continues
to
outpace
the
rest
of
the
Southeastern
Pennsylvania

in
job
growth
,
registering
an
average
job
growth
of

%
per

.

Financial
giants
Merrill

History
As
a
major
railroad
town
,
Altoona
was
founded
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
in
0000
as
the
site
for
a
shop
complex
.

Altoona
was
incorporated
as
a
borough
on
February
0
,
0000
,
and
as
a
city
under
legislation
approved
on
April
0
,
0000
,
and
February
0
,
0000
.

Altoona
The
word
Altoona
is
a
derivative
of
the
Latin
word
altus
,
meaning
"
high
"
.

This
explanation
for
the
naming
of
Altoona
is
contradicted
by
Pennsylvania
Place
Names
.

Although
Altoona
,
in
Blair
Country
,
is
popularly
known
as
"
the
Mountain
City
,
"
its
name
has
no
direct
or
indirect
etymological
relation
to
the
Latin
adjective
altus
,
signifying
"
elevated
,
lofty
.
"

Two
very
different
explanations
of
the
origin
of
this
name
are
current
.

The
one
which
seems
to
be
most
natural
and
reasonable
runs
as
follows
:
"
The
locomotive
engineer
who
ran
the
first
train
into
Altoona
in
0000
was
Robert
Steele
,
who
died
several
years
ago
,
aged
nearly
ninety
years
.

He
was
then
the
oldest
continuous
resident
of
the
city
.

He
was
much
respected
,
and
had
long
been
one
of
the
private
pensioners
of
Andrew
Carnegie
.

Mr.
Steele
is
authority
for
the
statement
that
Colonel
Beverly
Mayer
,
of
Columbia
,
Pennsylvania
,
who
,
as
a
civil
engineer
of
what
was
then
the
Pennsylvania
Central
Railway
,
had
laid
out
the
tracks
in
the
yards
of
the
newly
projected
city
,
named
the
place
Altoona
after
the
city
of
Altona
in
Schleswig-Holstein
,
which
became
part
of
Germany
in
0000
.
"

The
German
Altona
,
which
lies
on
the
right
bank
of
the
Elbe
immediately
west
of
Hamburg
,
is
an
important
railway
and
manufacturing
centre
with
a
population
of
nearly
000,000
.

The
etymological
derivation
of
the
name
Altona
is
not
known
with
certainty
,
but
widely
believed
to
be
Low
German
all
to
na
,
meaning
"
all
too
near
"
(
sc
.

The
popular
explanation
derives
the
name
of
Altoona
from
Allatoona
,
said
to
be
a
Cherokee
Indian
name
.

In
0000
David
Robinson
sold
his
farm
to
Archibald
Wright
of
Philadelphia
,
who
transferred
the
property
to
his
son
,
John
A.
Wright
,
who
laid
it
out
in
building
lots
,
became
one
of
the
founders
of
Altoona
,
and
was
responsible
for
the
naming
of
the
town
.

According
to
his
own
statement
,
he
had
spent
considerable
time
in
the
Cherokee
country
of
Georgia
,
where
he
had
been
especially
attracted
by
the
beautiful
name
of
Allatoona
,
which
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
new
town
in
the
belief
that
it
was
a
Cherokee
word
meaning
"
the
high
lands
of
great
worth
.
"

In
the
Cherokee
language
there
is
a
word
eladuni
,
which
means
"
high
lands
,
"
or
"
where
it
is
high
"
;
but
to
a
Cherokee
,
Allatoona
and
eladuni
are
so
different
that
the
former
could
hardly
be
derived
from
the
latter
.

An
older
history
dated
0000
favored
the
Cherokee
derivation
,
stating
that
"
Its
name
is
not
derived
from
the
Latin
word
altus
nor
from
the
French
word
alto
,
as
has
frequently
been
asserted
and
published
,
but
from
the
beautiful
,
liquid
,
and
expressive
Cherokee
word
allatoona
.

This
is
on
the
authority
of
the
person
who
bestowed
the
name
,
Mr.
Wright
,
of
Philadelphia
,
who
was
long
a
resident
of
the
Cherokee
country
in
Georgia
,
and
an
admirer
of
the
musical
names
of
that
Indian
language
.
"

Growth
The
town
grew
rapidly
in
the
late
00th
century
,
its
population
approximately
0,000
in
0000
,
00,000
in
0000
,
and
00,000
in
0000
.

The
demand
for
locomotive
s
during
the
Civil
War
stimulated
much
of
this
growth
,
and
by
the
later
years
of
the
war
Altoona
was
known
as
a
valuable
city
for
the
North
.

It
was
considered
by
Confederate
General
Robert
E.
Lee
as
a
target
during
the
Army
of
Northern
Virginia
's
mid-0000
entry
into
Pennsylvania
,
before
being
repelled
at
the
Battle
of
Gettysburg
.

Also
notable
is
the
Union
's
Loyal
War
Governors
'
Conference
,
held
at
Altoona
's
Logan
House
Hotel
,
which
politically
backed
Abraham
Lincoln
's
recently
released
Emancipation
Proclamation
following
Union
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Antietam
in
September
0000
.

Altoona
was
also
the
site
of
the
first
Interstate
Commission
meeting
to
create
and
design
the
Gettysburg
National
Cemetery
following
the
devastating
Battle
of
Gettysburg
.

The
centrality
and
convenience
of
the
town
's
rail
transportation
was
what
brought
these
two
important
gatherings
to
the
city
during
the
war
.

The
Horseshoe
Curve
The
Horseshoe
Curve
,
a
famous
curved
section
of
track
owned
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
has
become
a
tourist
attraction
and
National
Historic
Landmark
.

The
Curve
was
used
to
raise
trains
to
a
sufficient
elevation
to
cross
the
Allegheny
Ridge
to
the
west
,
beyond
which
were
the
steel
town
of
Pittsburgh
,
the
Great
Lakes
,
and
the
rest
of
the
western
United
States
.

The
Allegheny
Ridge
had
been
a
major
barrier
and
construction
of
the
Erie
Canal
in
New
York
twenty
years
earlier
already
had
diverted
much
port
traffic
which
had
used
Philadelphia
to
New
York
City
instead
,
causing
the
rise
of
that
city
's
commercial
dominance
.

Because
the
Curve
was
an
industrial
link
to
the
western
U.S.
,
the
Horseshoe
Curve
was
a
primary
target
of
eight
Nazi
saboteurs
who
had
infiltrated
the
United
States
during
World
War
II
(
0000
)
by
being
dropped
off
by
U-boat
s
of
the
German
Navy
(
Kriegsmarine
)
during
Operation
Pastorius
.

The
Railroad
In
the
early
00th
century
,
the
Railroad
's
Altoona
Works
complex
employed
,
at
its
peak
,
approximately
00,000
people
and
covered
three
miles
(
0
km
)
in
length
,
000
acres
(
000,000
m
²
)
of
yards
and
00
acres
(
000,000
m
²
)
of
indoor
workshop
floor
space
in
000
buildings
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
built
many
of
its
own
locomotives
at
the
Works
,
some
0,000
in
all
,
the
last
being
constructed
in
0000
.

The
Railroad
had
a
significant
influence
on
the
city
,
creating
the
city
's
fire
departments
and
relocating
the
hospital
to
a
site
nearer
to
the
shop
's
gates
.

Today
,
the
fire
department
employs
00
personnel
and
is
the
largest
career
department
between
Harrisburg
and
Pittsburgh
,
PA.
.

The
railroad
sponsored
a
city
band
and
constructed
Cricket
Field
(
a
sports
complex
)
.

In
0000
,
the
Railroad
built
the
Mechanic
's
Library
,
the
first
industrial
library
in
the
nation
which
exists
today
as
the
Altoona
Public
Library
.

With
the
decline
in
railroad
demand
after
World
War
II
,
things
began
to
decline
steadily
afterwards
,
with
most
of
the
plant
is
now
gone
.

Many
of
the
historic
treasures
of
the
city
's
history
have
also
disappeared
,
including
the
aforementioned
Logan
House
Hotel
.

Altoona
Today
Altoona
is
one
of
the
dual

Cathedral
of
the
Blessed

was
made
a
cathedral
and
rechristened
from
St.
John
's
Church
in

.

The

First
Lutheran
Church
on
the
corner
of
00th
Street
and
00th
Avenue
.

The
Station
Medical
Center
,
formerly
known
as
the
Station
Mall
,
was
a
downtown
mall
built
during
the
0000s
in
place
of
many
old
railroad
shops
.

The
downtown
contains
most
of
what
's
known
as
Altoona
's
Little
Italy
district
.

Because
of
the
geography
of
the
area
,
exact
or
natural
boundaries
for
Downtown
are
not
present
.

Therefore
Downtown
is
generally
defined
by
what
the
City
has
zoned
as
Central
Business
:
between
00th
Ave
and
the
PRR
Expressway
,
and
from
0th
Street
to
00th
Street
.

However
it
is
common
for
areas
within
Logantown
and
Center
City
to
be
expressed
locally
as
"
downtown
.
"

One
unique
little
known
fact
is
that
the
Texas
Hot
Dog
was
originally
created
in
downtown
Altoona
in
0000
,
although
the
Paterson
,
New
Jersey
Texas
Hot
Dog
location
,
which
opened
in
0000
,
is
more
famous
.

Architecture
The
commercial
core
of
the
downtown
includes
many
multistory
residential
,
commercial
,
and
mixed-use
facilities
designed
in
at
the
turn-of-the-00th-century
in
a
mix
of
Victorian
,
Edwardian
Baroque
,
and
Neo-Romanesque
styles
.

This
style
features
high
ceilings
,
resulting
in
taller
buildings
than
is
typical
for
the
number
of
floors
.

The
high
ceilings
are
typically
made
of
either
tin
or
plaster
,
although
sometimes
a
drop
ceiling
is
utilized
.

Individual
homes
originally
provided
housing
to
managers
and
executives
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
and
can
be
best
recognized
by
the
structural
similarities
to
Victorian
or
Edwardian
mansions
,
but
built
very
narrow
and
tall
with
little
to
no
space
between
the
two
structures
.

These
are
sometimes
used
as
double
or
triple
family
apartments
or
even
converted
into
commercial
space
.

Outside
of
the
commercial
core
is
a
mosaic
of
multistory
commercial
structures
,
mixed
use
facilities
,
single
story
commercial
structures
,
apartment
buildings
,
multi-unit
housing
,
and
single-family
homes
.

Industrial
Decline
and
Urban
Renewal
As
has
been
typical
of
many
rust
belt
cities
,
the
economic
downturn
of
the
railroad
resulted
in
the
closure
of
many
of
the
downtown
's
landmark
stores
and
industries
;
and
the
simultaneous
rise
in
prominence
of
the
automobile
shifted
commercial
development
to
the
suburbs
.

However
,
through
recent
revitalization
efforts
,
Altoona
's
downtown
maintains
a
significant
level
of
economic
vitality
and
hosts
few
office
and
residential
vacancies
.

The
downtown
maintains
a
significant
focus
on
pedestrian-oriented
development
,
as
evidenced
by
the
presence
of
more
pedestrian
bridges
and
underpasses
across
the
railroad
tracks
(
connecting
the
two
parts
of
Downtown
)
than
automobile
crossings
.

Penn
State
Altoona
has
bought
several
downtown
buildings
,
including
the
former
Playhouse
Theater
building
,
the
six-story
Penn
Furniture
building
,
and
the
former
WRTA
building
.

The
University
has
turned
them
into
the
Devorris
Downtown
Center
,
the
Aaron
Building
and
the
Kazmaier
Family
Building
.

Recently
Sheetz
has
added
another
building
to
Penn
State
Altoona
called
The
Sheetz
Center
for
Entrepreneurial
Excellence
on
the
former
site
of
a
department
store
just
behind
the
Amtrak
Station
.

The
University
provides
a
flow
of
resources
into
the
downtown
,
aiding
in
revitalization
efforts
.

As
an
example
of
the
university
's
value
to
the
downtown
's
economy
,
the
installation
of
the
Blue
Lot
near
the
Wolf
Court
Building
has
improved
the
economic
attraction
of
downtown
by
offering
up
to
three
hours
of
free
parking
.

A
bike
path
connecting
the
Campus
to
Downtown
Altoona
has
also
been
built
.

Center
City
Center
City
comprises
industrial
and
commercial
zones
as
well
as
urban
and
multiple
household
residential
zones
.

Often
,
the
Center
City
,
Little
Italy
,
and
Gospel
Hill
areas
(
as
well
as
Lower
Fairview
)
are
included
as
part
of
"
downtown
"
for
tourism
and
promotional
purposes
,
much
like
how
the
Strip
District
in
Pittsburgh
is
promoted
.

This
is
due
to
both
the
proximity
and
the
fact
that
the
buildings
from
these
sections
are
similar
to
downtown
buildings
and
blend
in
with
the
skyline
.

On
the
west
side
of
the
tracks
,
Center
City
extends
around
Downtown
0-0
blocks
with
heavy
residential
,
industrial
and
commercial
to
the
north
,
south
and
west
.

The
eastern
side
of
the
tracks
,
which
according
to
the
public
maps
is
called
"
East
Side
,
"
runs
along
the
length
of
the
tracks
from
0st
Street
to
00rd
street
and
from
the
tracks
to
0th
Ave
west
to
east
.

However
,
the
Altoona
Area
High
School
is
considered
Center
City
despite
standing
on
the
Dutch
Hill
side
of
0th
Ave.
The
East
Side
of
Center
City
is
home
to
the
High
School
and
Junior
High
,
the
former
Roosevelt
Junior
High
School
,
the
Altoona
Railroaders
Museum
,
Boyer
Candies
,
the
Station
Medical
Center
of
Altoona
Regional
Health
System
,
as
well
as
many
current
and
old
railroad
facilities
.

Little
Italy
and
Gospel
Hill
The
neighborhood
area
known
as
Little
Italy
is
the
neighborhood
between
0th
Street
and
00th
Street
north
to
south
and
0th
Ave
to
0th
Ave
west
to
east
,
sometimes
this
is
extended
to
include
the
Station
Medical
Center
.

Gospel
Hill
is
the
neighborhood
in
the
area
of
00th
Street
and
00th
Ave
and
adjacent
to
the
park
of
the
same
name
.

Logantown
Logantown
is
the
area
just
north
of
the
Downtown
and
is
considered
a
direct
extension
of
Downtown
.

It
borders
Fairview
along
00th
Ave
,
Willow
Ave
and
Cherry
Ave
to
the
north
,
00th
Ave
and
Chestnut
Ave
to
the
south
,
and
Juniata
Gap
Road
to
the
east
.

This
is
where
Altoona
Regional
Hospital
of
the
Altoona
Regional
Health
System
is
located
,
which
is
the
tallest
building
in
Altoona
at
00
Floors
.

This
is
also
where
Cricket
Field
used
to
be
located
.

Logantown
is
zoned
as
a
mix
of
commercial
and
residential
,
and
contains
some
of
the
oldest
houses
built
in
Altoona
that
are
still
standing
.

Fairview
Fairview
is
a
mostly
residential
area
North
and
West
of
Downtown
and
Logantown
.

It
borders
Calvert
Hills
to
the
south
at
00th
Street
,
Downtown
and
Logantown
to
the
east
along
00th
Ave
and
Willow
Ave
and
then
along
Cherry
Ave
after
0th
Street
,
and
borders
Juniata
Gap
Road
to
the
north
.

Fairview
is
zoned
as
multiple
household
residential
in
the
areas
directly
bordering
Downtown
,
and
transitions
to
single
household
residential
after
00st
Ave
,
and
eventually
to
suburban
after
00th
Ave.
At
times
,
you
see
some
single
unit
houses
on
00th
through
00th
Avenues
,
and
00th
through
00th
Streets
,
amongst
much
taller
office
,
retail
,
and
apartment
buildings
.

Many
of
the
houses
in
the
part
of
downtown
near
Fairview
and
lower
Fairview
are
the
middle-density
mansions
originally
owned
by
managers
and
executives
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

The
most
striking
example
of
this
is
the
Penn
Alto
residential
hotel
on
the
corner
of
00th
Avenue
and
00th
Street
,
which
has
two
single-unit
houses
next
to
it
.

Conversely
,
there
are
a
few
multistory
residential
and
commercial
buildings
on
00th
Avenue
.

Fairview
could
be
best
described
as
the
urban
neighborhoods
that
one
would
expect
to
find
just
outside
of
a
downtown
.

One
of
the
sections
of
the
downtown
is
called
"
Lower
Fairview
"
due
to
its
transitionary
nature
.

Or
perhaps
it
can
be
said
that
lower
Fairview
is
an
extension
of
downtoen
,
up
to
00th
or
even
00th
avenue
.

The
houses
between
00th
and
00th
avenues
(
with
two
commercial
buildings
included
)
on
00th
street
are
designed
based
on
an
architectural
pattern
used
in
Philadelphia
's
urban
neighborhoods
.

Dutch
Hill
Dutch
Hill
district
contains
an
abundance
of
historic
neighborhoods
and
traditional
"
corner
markets
"
.

This
section
gets
its
name
from
the
abundance
of
Germans
who
moved
into
this
area
when
the
City
was
still
expanding
.

Dutch
Hill
is
the
area
that
borders
the
City
Center
to
the
East
and
is
zoned
as
multiple
household
residential
.

The
boundaries
are
generally
considered
0th
Street
to
00th
Street
north
to
south
,
and
0th
Ave
to
Walton
Ave
from
west
to
east
.

However
as
the
Altoona
Area
High
School
and
Junior
High
are
considered
City
Center
,
the
border
is
around
0th
Ave
(
or
0rd
Ave
if
the
entire
school
zone
is
included
)
when
between
00th
Street
and
00th
Street
.

Juniata
Juniata
is
defined
as
north
of
Juniata
Gap
Road
,
east
of
East
00th
Ave
and
on
the
west
side
of
the
tracks
.

However
,
north
of
Broadway
Street
,
everything
east
of
Wopsononock
Ave
and
Grandview
Road
is
Juniata
.

The
area
is
zoned
as
mostly
residential
limited
,
but
also
uniquely
has
a
significant
area
of
light
and
heavy
industrial
as
well
as
a
central
business
area
.

This
is
because
Juniata
was
once
its
own
city
,
and
was
incorporated
into
Altoona
in
the
late
00th
century
.

Because
of
this
,
the
section
's
street
names
had
conflicting
numbers
with
the
rest
of
the
City
,
and
had
to
be
given
a
North
prefix
.

The
commercial
area
is
sometimes
nicknamed
"
downtown
Juniata
.
"

The
most
important
street
in
Juniata
's
L-shaped
commercial
district
is
North
Fourth
Avenue
.

The
J.L.
Noble
School
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

The
original
Thompson
's
Pharmacy
was
on
0nd
Street
in
Juniata
before
moving
a
few
blocks
to
a
larger
main
store
and
branching
out
to
become
a
small
,
local
chain
.

East
End
The
East
End
is
typically
defined
as
the
area
on
the
east
side
of
the
tracks
north
of
0th
Street
.

It
is
called
the
East
End
because
it
borders
the
north
end
of
the
tracks
where
trains
would
depart
east
towards
Philadelphia
.

Because
of
this
,
most
streets
have
an
East
prefix
.

The
East
End
is
mostly
single
household
residential
and
suburban
,
but
has
small
areas
of
residential-commercial
and
neighborhood
business
along
Kettle
Street
and
Lloyd
Street
,
as
well
as
highway
business
along
Pleasant
Valley
Blvd.
.

Pleasant
Valley
Pleasant
Valley
is
the
area
that
centers
around
Pleasant
Valley
Boulevard
,
which
is
a
massive
stretch
of
highway
business
that
runs
the
entire
length
of
Altoona
.

The
massive
Sheetz
store
known
locally
as
"
Supersheetz
"
is
located
here
along
00th
Street
and
was
the
first
of
its
kind
ever
built
.

The
area
is
defined
as
southeast
of
Walton
Ave
and
extends
from
0st
Street
til
00nd
Street
and
defined
by
Polk
Ave
to
the
east
.

As
well
as
the
large
highway
business
area
,
Pleasant
Valley
also
has
an
even
amount
of
single
household
residential
and
suburban
along
with
some
small
stretches
of
residential
commercial
and
urban
.

Eldorado
Eldorado
,
pronounced
locally
,
El-doe-ray-doe
,
is
the
southern
section
of
Altoona
,
south
of
Logan
Boulevard
and
west
of
0th

as
well
as
a
small
section
south
of
00th

all
the
way
to
Rhode
Island
Ave.
(
Goods
Lane
)
in
the
east
.

Eldorado
is
zoned

almost
entirely
suburban
,
with
small
areas
of
light
industrial
and
neighborhood
business
.

The
Sheetz
Headquarters
is
located
in
this
area
.

At
one
time
,
this
section
was
also
known
as
the
"
West
End
"
because
trains
leaving
the
south
end
of
town
head
west
towards
Pittsburgh
.

Some
parts
of
Eldorado
are
actually
outside
of
incorporated

and
located
in

just
outside
of
the
official
border
of
the
City
and
designated
as
the
"

"
it
is
commonly
accepted
as
a

,
especially
since
a
0

0
block
zone
lies
within
the
city
limits
.

.

On
an

day
,

trains
pass
though
Altoona
.

The
historical
importance
to
the
railroad
industry
and
the
current
high
level
of
railroad
activity
has
made

a
mecca
for
railfans
for
over
00
years
,
with
the
Railroaders
Memorial
Museum
and
the
Horseshoe
Curve
being
popular
spots
for

passing
trains

Curve
.

Local
bus
service
in
the
city
is
provided
by

.

In
0000
,
AMTRAN
customers
suffered
a
major
loss
in
service
due
to
cuts
in
state
funding
.

In
May
of
that
year
,
Governor
Rendell
visited
Altoona
to
discuss
plans
intended
to
rectify
this
situation
.

Economy
Historically
,
the
sole
economic
force
driving
the
growth
of
Altoona
into
a
City
was
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
.

While
the
various
local
railroad
shops
still
employ
over
a
thousand
people
,
they
are
no
longer
the
driving
economic
engine
of
the
area
.

The
top
field
of
employment
in
Altoona
and
the
metro
area
is
healthcare
.

Facilities

:
Altoona
Regional
Health
System
with

of
doctors
offices
,
and
over
00
nursing
homes
and

living
facilities
.

Another
massive
employer
is

service
industries

Altoona
is
the
linchpin
of

a
wide
geographic
area
that
extends
to
State
College
and
Johnstown
and
over
south
along
I-00
past
I-00
.

Altoona
draws
the
most
retail
customers
in
the
region
due
to
its
centralized
location
and
to
the
fact
that
it
has
the
best
complimentary
retail
of
the
three
markets
with
of
retail
space
.

The
scale
and
diversity
of
retail
within
the
City
of
Altoona
and
the
surrounding
area
is
not
paralleled
within
the
region
.

The
areas
of
retail
include
:

-
loving
British
investor
s.
Cricket

not

History
In
0000
,
Samuel
Duncan
,
recognizing
the
excellent
possibilities
for
land
development
,
purchased
land
on
the
western
banks
of
the
stream
,
which
traversed
the
area
and
plotted
a
town
,
which
he
named
Duncansville
.

About
the
same
time
Jacob
Walters
laid
out
plots
of
land
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
stream
and
called
his
settlement
Walterstown
.

Confusion
and
some
rivalry
existed
between
the
two
settlements
.

Both
Duncan
and
Walters
agreed
that
a
common
name
should
be
used
for
the
two
places
.

They
decided
to
cast
lots
to
select
the
name
to
be
used
.

The
people
of
both
settlements
declared
a
holiday
and
arranged
quite
a
celebration
for
the
occasion
.

All
assembled
at
the
wooden
bridge
separating
the
two
towns
.

A
coin
was
tossed
and
fortune
favored
Duncan
,
thereby
uniting
the
two
communities
under
the
name
of
Duncansville
.

History
During
the
late
00th
century
,
Patrick
Cassidy
,
a
native
of
Newry
,
Ireland
and
an
American
soldier
in
the
American
Revolutionary
War
,
purchased
three
hundred
acres
of
land
in
Huntingdon
County
,
Pennsylvania
.

This
is
now
known
as
Blair
County
.

C.
0000
,
where
he
constructed
a
small
town
on
the
land
,
which
he
named
for
his
home
.

A
half-century
later
,
Newry
flourished
as
the
Allegheny
Portage
Railroad
began
to
carry
passengers
from
Hollidaysburg
across
the
Alleghenies
to
Johnstown
.

Newry
's
location
made
it
a
suitable
stop
for
the
railroad
and
this
new
influx
of
visitors
stimulated
the
economy
of
the
town
.

This
prosperity
lasted
from
the
0000s
to
the
0000s
,
when
the
railroad
closed
.

During
the
following
century
,
the
town
decreased
in
population
and
quietly
shifted
from
an
urban
to
a
rural
center
until
the
0000s
,
when
migration
of
Altoonans
from
the
north
began
to
increase
the
size
of
Newry
and
gave
it
a
more
suburban
character
.

Businesses
and
institutions
The
majority
of
Newry
's
businesses
are

Patrick
's
Parish
,
are

fish
fries

and
the
summer
festival
,
held

end
of
August
on
the
school
playground
and
in
the
gymnasium
.

Both

through
a
few

,
the
Catfish
Road
goes
through
a
few
miles
of
sparse
farmland
,
interrupted
by
a
few
houses
and
a

Roaring
Spring
is
a
borough
in
Blair
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

It
is
part
of
the
Altoona
,
PA
Metropolitan
Statistical
Area
History
Roaring
Spring
was
established
around
the
Big
Spring
in
Morrison
's
Cove
,
a
clean
and
dependable
water
source
vital
to
the
operation
of
a
paper
mill
.

Prior
to
0000
,
when
the
first
paper
mill
was
built
,
Roaring
Spring
had
been
a
grist
mill
hamlet
with
a
country
store
at
the
intersection
of
two
rural
roads
that
lead
to
the
mill
near
the
spring
.

A
grist
mill
,
powered
by
the
spring
water
,
had
operated
at
that
location
since
at
least
the
0000s
.

After
0000
,
as
the
paper
mill
expanded
,
surrounding
tracts
of
land
were
acquired
to
accommodate
housing
development
for
new
workers
.

The
formalization
of
a
town
plan
,
however
,
never
occurred
.

As
a
result
,
the
seemingly
random
street
pattern
of
the
historic
district
is
the
product
of
hilly
topography
,
a
small
network
of
pre-existing
country
roads
that
converged
near
the
Big
Spring
,
and
the
property
lines
of
adjacent
tracts
that
were
acquired
through
the
years
for
community
expansion
.

The
arterial
streets
of
the
district
are
now
East
Main
,
West
Main
,
Spang
and
Bloomfield
,
each
of
which
leads
out
of
the
borough
to
surrounding
townships
.

Two
of
these
streets
—
Spang
and
East
Main
—
meet
with
Church
Street
at
the
district
's
main
intersection
called
"
Five
Points
.
"

The
boundaries
of
the
district
essentially
include
those
portions
of
Roaring
Spring
Borough
which
had
been
laid
out
for
development
by
the
early
0000s
.

This
area
encompasses
or
00
percent
of
the
borough
's
area
of

Since
the
district
's
period
of
significance
extends
to
0000
,
most
of
those
buildings
erected
after
the
0000s
were
built
as
infill
within
the
areas
already
subdivided
by
the
0000s
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
Borough
began
to
annex
sections
of
adjacent
Taylor
Township
,
especially
to
the
east
around
the
then
new
Rt.
00
Bypass
.

Daniel
Mathias
(
D.

)
Bare
laid
out
Roaring
Spring
's
first
00
building
lots
in
0000
after
he
and
two
partners
decided
to
locate
the
region
's
first
paper
mill
near
the
spring
.

These
lots
were
located
within
and
around
the
so-called
village
"
triangle
"
defined
by
West
Main
,
Spang
,
and
East
Main
Streets
.

By
0000
,
the
borough
contained
about
000
lots
and
00
buildings
,
which
included
the
paper
and
grist
mills
,
three
churches
,
a
company
store
,
a
schoolhouse
,
and
one
hotel
.

The
population
stood
at
about
000
.

The
triangle
remained
the
industrial
,
commercial
and
retailing
core
of
the
town
until
0000
when
the
bypass
of
Main
Street
,
PA
Rt.
00
,
was
built
to
the
east
of
town
through
Taylor
Township
.

As
is
true
of
many
American
small
towns
,
many
village
merchants
along
with
new
businesses
have
since
relocated
to
the
new
highway
.

The
village
core
retains
only
a
few
shops
and
professional
offices
,
but
still
holds
the
Roaring
Spring
Blank
Book
Company
and
Roaring
Spring
Water
Bottling
Company
,
all
of
the
historic
church
buildings
,
the
public
library
(
formerly
the
Eldon

,
the
borough
building
,
the
post
office
(
earlier
moved
from
farther
up
East
Main

The
elementary
school
(
former

Description
The
Roaring
Spring
Historic
District
is
located
within
the
Borough
of
Roaring
Spring
,
a
paper-mill
town
of
about
0,000
established
in
the
late
0000s
in
southern
Blair
County
,
south-central
Pennsylvania
.

[

]
Roaring
Spring
is
situated
within
the
northwest
quadrant
of
a
long
bowl-like
valley
known
as
Morrisons
Cove
,
one
of
dozens
of
long
but
broad
valleys
in
Pennsylvania
's
Ridge
and
Valley
region
.

The
town
developed
just
southeast
of
a
natural
pass
into
the
valley
called
McKee
's
Gap
where
an
important
iron
smelting
business
(
Martha
Furnace
)
operated
through
the
mid
00th
century
.

The
site
of
Roaring
Spring
is
moderately
hilly
,
drained
by
Cabbage
and
Halter
Creeks
.

The
most
prominent
natural
feature
is
the
Big
Spring
,
or
Roaring
Spring
,
a
large
natural
limestone
spring
so-called
because
of
the
great
noise
its
eight-million-gallon-a-day
stream
once
made
rushing
out
of
the
hillside
near
the
village
center
.

[

]
Roaring
Spring
is
overwhelmingly
residential
(
00
percent
)
in
scale
,
but
also
includes
churches
,
stops
,
professional
offices
,
a
municipal
building
,
parks
,
a
cemetery
,
a
book
factory
complex
,
and
a
former
railroad
station
.

Most
houses
are
two-story
,
wood-frame
single-family
buildings
situated
on
lots
of
to
.

The
largest
segment
of
the
building
stock
between
0000
and
0000
was
constructed
between
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Architecturally
,
the
district
contains
a
variety
of
late
00th
to
early
00th
century
styles
and
vernacular
building
types
,
including
Gothic
Revival
,
Queen
Anne
,
Colonial
Revival
,
Bungalow
,
Foursquare
,
Gable
Fronts
,
Gable
Fronts
&
Wings
,
I
Houses
,
and
double-pile
Georgian
types
.

Ninety
(
00
)
percent
of
the
district
's
000
properties
is
rated
as
contributing
.

The
remaining
00
percent
consists
of
buildings
less
than
00
years
old
(
constructed
after
0000
)
or
older
buildings
whose
architectural
integrity
has
been
lost
through
inappropriate
alterations
.

Overall
,
most
alterations
,
such
as
inappropriate
replacement
of
windows
,
doors
and
porch
posts
,
are
reversible
if
desired
.

Roaring
Spring
was
established
around
the
Big
Spring
,
a
clean
and
dependable
water
source
vital
to
the
operation
of
a
paper
mill
.

Prior
to
0000
,
when
the
first
paper
mill
was
built
,
Roaring
Spring
had
been
a
grist-mill
hamlet
with
a
country
store
at
the
intersection
of
two
rural
roads
that
lead
to
the
mill
near
the
spring
.

A
grist
mill
,
which
was
powered
by
the
spring
water
,
had
operated
at
that
location
since
at
least
the
0000s
.

After
0000
,
as
the
paper
mill
expanded
,
surrounding
tracts
of
land
were
acquired
to
accommodate
housing
development
for
new
workers
.

The
formalization
of
a
town
plan
,
however
,
never
occurred
.

As
a
result
,
the
seemingly
random
street
pattern
of
the
historic
district
is
the
product
of
hilly
topography
,
a
small
network
of
pre-existing
country
roads
that
converged
near
the
Big
Spring
,
and
the
property
lines
of
adjacent
tracts
that
were
acquired
through
the
years
for
community
expansion
.

The
arterial
streets
of
the
district
are
now
East
Main
,
West
Main
,
Spang
and
Bloomfield
,
each
of
which
leads
out
of
the
borough
to
surrounding
townships
.

Two
of
these
streets
—
Spang
and
East
Main
—
meet
with
Church
Street
at
the
district
's
main
intersection
called
"
The
Five
Points
.
"

The
boundaries
of
the
district
essentially
include
those
portions
of
Roaring
Spring
Borough
which
had
been
laid
out
for
development
by
the
early
0000s
.

This
area
encompasses
or
00
percent
of
the
borough
's
area
of
.

Since
the
district
's
period
of
significance
extends
to
0000
,
most
of
those
buildings
erected
after
the
0000s
were
built
as
infill
within
the
areas
already
subdivided
by
the
0000s
.

In
the
early
0000s
,
the
Borough
began
to
annex
sections
of
adjacent
Taylor
Township
,
especially
to
the
east
around
the
then
new
Rt.
00
Bypass
.

Daniel
Mathias
(
D.
M.
)
Bare
laid
out
Roaring
Spring
's
first
00
building
lots
in
0000
after
he
and
two
partners
decided
to
locate
the
region
's
first
paper
mill
near
the
spring
.

[

]
These
lots
were
located
within
and
around
the
so-called
village
"
triangle
"
defined
by
West
Main
,
Spang
,
and
East
Main
Streets
.

By
0000
,
the
borough
contained
about
000
lots
and
00
buildings
,
which
included
the
paper
and
grist
mills
,
three
churches
,
a
company
store
,
a
schoolhouse
,
and
one
hotel
.

The
population
stood
at
about
000
.

The
triangle
remained
the
industrial
,
commercial
and
retailing
core
of
the
town
until
0000
when
the
bypass
of
East
Main
Street
,
PA
Rt.
00
,
was
built
to
the
east
of
town
through
Taylor
Township
.

As
is
true
of
many
American
small
towns
,
many
village
merchants
along
with
new
businesses
have
since
relocated
to
the
new
highway
.

The
village
core
retains
only
a
few
shops
and
professional
offices
,
but
still
holds
the
Roaring
Spring
Blank
Book
Company
and
Roaring
Spring
Water
Bottling
Company
,
all
of
the
historic
church
buildings
,
the
public
library
(
the
former
Eldon
Inn
)
,
the
borough
building
,
and
the
post
office
.

Most
of
the
historic
commercial
or
mixed-use
buildings
are
concentrated
in
the
village
triangle
.

These
include
an
assortment
of
strictly
commercial
properties
,
such
as
the
brick
,
three-story
Odd
Fellows
Hall
(
0000
)
with
its
storefront
and
meeting
hall
above
at
000
N.
Main
Street
,
the
three-story
,
wood-frame
Hite
's
Furniture
Store
(
ca.
0000
)
next
door
,
and
the
stone
,
three-story
,
semi-Romanesque
Roaring
Spring
Bank
(
0000
)
next
to
the
store
at
000
N.
Main
Street
.

All
three
stand
directly
across
the
street
from
the
former
location
of
the
Roaring
Spring
Department
Store
(
ca.
0000
)
,
otherwise
known
as
"
the
company
store
,
"
and
across
from
the
old
Borough
Building
and
Fire
Station
(
0000
)
.

The
grist
mill
,
demolished
in
the
0000s
,
which
also
housed
the
town
jail
and
street
department
,
was
between
the
borough
building
and
the
department
store
.

This
immediate
area
served
as
the
commercial
,
governmental
and
industrial
center
of
the
town
.

Directly
behind
the
company
store
to
the
west
is
the
paper
mill
,
while
next
door
to
the
former
Borough
Building
once
stood
the
Bare
flour
mill
(
demolished
0000s
)
,
the
early
industrial
forerunner
to
the
paper
mill
.

Mixed-use
examples
within
this
village
area
include
the
three-story
brick
Zook
Building
(
ca.
0000
)
at
East
Main
and
Cemetery
Streets
,
which
formerly
housed
the
post
office
,
and
two
wood-frame
store
fronts
with
second-floor
apartments
on
East
Main
.

Another
well-preserved
example
of
this
traditional
mixed-use
type
is
the
former
Stump
's
Grocery
Store
at
Spang
and
Poplar
Streets
.

While
located
outside
of
the
village
triangle
,
the
general
store
was
built
by
John
F.
Himes
to
serve
one
of
the
first
new
residential
areas
developed
after
the
paper
mill
's
plant
expansion
of
0000
.

The
store
was
originally
started
at
the
five
points
where
the
borough
building
now
stands
and
was
moved
to
poplar
street
across
from
his
home
.

Himes
also
operated
a
vinyard
bordered
by
today
's
Spang
,
Girard
,
Poplar
,
and
Cherry
Streets
of
which
one
vine
remains
(
as
of
0000
)
.

He
arrived
as
a
German
immigrant
and
worked
as
a
stable
boy
at
his
uncle
's
hotel
,
which
held
the
dry
town
's
last
(
and
maybe
only
)
liquor
license
at
the
corner
of
Spang
and
West
Main
Street
across
from
the
railroad
station
.

He
also
was
instrumental
in
building
St.
Luke
's
Lutheran
Church
at
the
corner
of
Girard
and
East
Main
Street
.

In
the
decades
following
the
Civil
War
,
single-family
residential
development
gradually
spread
over
the
low
hills
surrounding
the
village
center
.

Roaring
Spring
's
patterns
of
growth
were
largely
determined
by
the
periods
of
expansion
for
the
paper
mill
and
the
Roaring
Spring
Blank
Book
Company
,
an
affiliated
business
.

The
opening
of
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
branch
line
from
Altoona
in
0000
also
stimulated
a
great
deal
of
growth
.

During
these
periods
,
parcels
of
adjacent
land
or
woodland
were
purchased
and
subdivided
for
new
house
construction
.

Through
the
00th
century
,
one
of
the
larger
private
developers
was
D.
M.
Bare
.

One
example
of
his
work
is
the
lots
along
Park
Avenue
,
a
site
which
he
subdivided
and
sold
off
in
0000
after
acquiring
the
George
Spang
Farm
.

Most
homes
in
the
district
are
set
back
between
one
to
from
the
sidewalks
.

The
lots
are
relatively
narrow
(
00
–
00
ft.
)
but
deep
(
000
–
000
ft.
)
with
ample
backyards
that
often
hold
one-story
frame
or
brick
garages
on
an
alley
serving
an
entire
block
.

Average
density
is
five
to
seven
houses
per
acre
.

This
configuration
—
a
single-family
house
sited
close
to
the
front
lot
line
with
a
detached
service
building
at
the
rear
of
a
long
backyard
—
is
the
basic
lot
layout
of
towns
in
central
Pennsylvania
.

Most
of
the
rear-lot
service
buildings
are
either
small
00th
century
carriage
barns
converted
to
garages
or
00th
century
auto
garages
,
depending
upon
the
age
of
the
house
.

The
carriage
barns
are
generally
wood
frame
while
the
garages
tend
to
be
brick
,
depending
upon
the
building
material
of
the
house
.

The
moderately
sloping
topography
did
little
to
impede
local
builders
,
who
merely
terraced
the
sites
and
erected
stone
retaining
walls
to
hold
the
yards
.

Because
of
the
town
's
relatively
stable
employment
patterns
since
the
0000s
,
Roaring
Spring
has
enjoyed
a
high
degree
of
home
ownership
.

Of
the
000
buildings
in
the
district
,
over
00
percent
were
originally
built
as
homes
,
most
of
which
are
single-family
dwellings
.

Besides
single-family
houses
,
the
district
contains
00
apartments
(
mostly
converted
single-family
residences
)
;
00
mixed-use
buildings
(
commercial/residential
)
;
00
professional/commercial
buildings
(
mostly
converted
houses
)
;
seven
municipal
properties
;
six
industrial
buildings
(
mostly
the
Blank
Book
complex
)
;
eight
churches
;
and
one
cemetery
.

Sixty-three
(
00
)
percent
of
the
district
's
building
stock
(
contributing
and
noncontributing
)
is
wood-frame
;
00
percent
is
brick
;
the
remaining
0
percent
is
stone
or
concrete
block
.

With
the
exception
of
a
few
industrial
or
commercial
buildings
like
the
Blank
Book
Co.
and
the
Planing
Mill
,
nearly
all
of
the
district
's
brick
buildings
(
mostly
houses
)
are
actually
brick
veneer
over
wood
framing
.

The
use
of
brick
as
a
construction
material
peaked
in
the
0000s
.

Eighty-two
(
00
)
percent
of
the
foundations
are
stone
,
which
supports
almost
all
buildings
erected
before
ca.
0000
.

While
stone
as
a
foundation
material
is
common
in
pre-0000s
buildings
,
its
use
as
a
structural
material
is
very
rare
due
in
large
measure
to
the
common
availability
and
economy
of
sawn
lumber
,
and
the
age
of
the
community
which
postdated
the
vernacular
use
of
stone
as
a
regional
building
material
.

As
a
foundation
material
,
stone
was
generally
replaced
in
the
0000s
by
cast
concrete
block
(
generally
molded
as
a
rock-face
ashlar
)
,
which
in
turn
was
succeeded
by
cinderblock
and
poured
concrete
after
the
0000s
.

After
concrete
and
cinderblock
,
concrete
block
is
the
third
most
common
foundation
material
(
almost
0
percent
)
;
it
was
also
employed
for
garages
,
outbuildings
and
additions
in
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Most
contributing
houses
bear
full
front
porches
,
the
vast
majority
of
which
are
intact
.

Original
roof
materials
were
generally
slate
or
tin
(
raised
seam
,
corrugated
,
or
pressed
pattern
)
.

While
a
fair
number
survive
,
many
others
have
been
replaced
for
economy
with
modern
asphalt
shingle
.

Even
where
original
slate
roofs
have
been
replaced
,
many
decorative
slate
shingles
covering
the
fascia
boards
of
large
window
gables
survive
,
especially
on
turn-of-the-century
Gothic
Revival
types
.

This
decorative
practice
,
fairly
common
on
houses
built
from
0000
to

by
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
Co.
,
can
be
seen
in
other
period
buildings
around
the
Morrisons
Cove
area
where
the
Planing
Mill
's
contractors
are
known
to
have
worked
.

Stylistically
,
the
historic
house
types
of
Roaring
Spring
are
largely
vernacular
adaptations
of
nationally
common
styles
between
the
0000s
and
early
00th
century
.

From
the
0000s
to
0000s
,
these
included
Gothic
Revivals
,
Queen
Annes
,
Gable
Fronts
,
Gable
Front
&
Wings
,
I-Houses
and
double-pile
Georgian
types
.

From
the
0000s
to
0000s
,
a
period
which
accounts
for
00
percent
of
the
historic
housing
stock
,
these
included
Bungalows
,
Four
Squares
,
Colonial
Revivals
,
and
Cape
Cod
types
,
sometimes
modestly
detailed
with
Craftsman
or
Colonial
Revival
trim
.

The
various
styles
and
types
generally
reflect
the
national
trends
in
builders
'
homes
during
those
periods
.

Those
houses
built
after
the
period
of
significance
(
post
0000
)
tend
to
be
later
Cape
Cod
types
,
ranches
,
bi-levels
and
a
variety
of
other
suburban
builders
'
homes
.

The
greatest
number
of
extant
Gable-Fronts
(
or
Temple-Fronts
)
in
the
district
were
built
between
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
although
a
few
older
examples
date
to
the
0000s
.

A
number
of
variations
exist
,
such
as
the
Gable
Front
&
Wing
and
the
Gable-Front
&
T
Wing
,
the
latter
a
local
variant
that
builders
from
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
seemed
to
have
favored
in
the
0000s
.

Most
houses
are
balloon-frame
construction
,
however
,
the
Four-Square
,
built
here
in
the
greatest
numbers
between
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
is
equally
divided
between
wood
and
brick
.

Queen
Annes
range
from
the
0000s
to
0000s
,
and
are
often
really
Four-Squares
in
form
beneath
a
slightly
more
complicated
roofline
and
decorated
wall
surface
(
ornamental
slate
or
wood
shingles
)
usually
concentrated
in
the
gables
.

The
I
-
House
,
which
ranges
primarily
between
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
is
also
equally
divided
between
wood
and
brick
.

The
center-door
"
Georgian
"
type
(
double-pile
,
side-gable
roof
,
symmetrical
massing
)
was
built
here
between
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
with
most
examples
ranging
from
four
to
five
bays
in
width
.

After
the
Civil
War
,
local
builders
often
gave
this
type
a
large
centered
front
gable
,
creating
a
Gothic
Revival
look
,
especially
since
most
of
these
examples
held
full
front
porches
with
Gothic
Revival
trim
.

The
Bungalow
type
,
while
not
as
common
as
the
preceding
four
,
was
prevalent
between
the
0000s
and
0000s
.

Many
of
the
vernacular
Gothic
Revival
and
I-House
dwellings
,
which
line
Locust
Street
in
the
Hogback
neighborhood
south
of
the
mill
,
date
from
the
late
0000s
to
0000s
.

Farther
away
from
the
mill
,
on
a
hillside
at
the
east
end
of
the
district
,
stand
dozens
of
Four-Squares
,
Gable
Fronts
,
and
late
Gothic
Revival
types
built
after
the
mill
expansions
of
0000
and
0000
.

These
examples
are
found
along
New
,
Poplar
,
Walnut
and
Cherry
Streets
.

Bungalow
types
from
the
0000
to
0000s
are
scattered
throughout
the
district
in
wood
or
brick
.

The
triangular
area
of
the
old
commercial
village
contains
a
mixture
of
residential
,
mixed-use
,
and
commercial
buildings
dating
from
the
0000s
to
the
early
0000s
.

Of
the
commercial
types
,
perhaps
the
most
impressive
is
the
Eldon
Inn
(
0000
)
,
a
three-story
,
brick
Colonial
Revival
at
Main
and
Girard
Streets
built
close
to
the
passenger
station
for
the
convenience
of
railroad
travelers
.

The
inn
,
which
never
served
liquor
,
was
built
by
Bare
and
his
three
sons-in-law
,
in
large
measure
to
keep
the
town
dry
as
it
had
been
since
the
0000s
.

The
oldest
known
residence
in
this
area
is
the
Wilderson
House
(
ca.
0000
)
,
a
typical
wood-frame
I-House
fronting
on
West
Main
Street
just
south
of
Girard
Street
.

The
district
's
eight
churches
,
constructed
of
either
brick
,
stone
,
or
wood
,
were
built
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
oldest
is
the
wood-frame
Mennonite
meeting
house
on
Poplar
Street
overlooking
North
Main
,
originally
built
for
the
Methodist
congregation
in
0000
.

The
builder
was
the
Rev.
John
A.
J.
Williams
,
a
carpenter
by
trade
,
who
also
served
briefly
as
Methodist
minister
.

The
two
most
prominently
sited
churches
stand
at
the
Five
Points
intersection
:
the
Bare
Memorial
Church
of
God
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
a
large
brick
building
supported
by
the
Bare
family
at
East
Main
and
Church
Streets
,
and
the
Trinity
United
Methodist
Church
(
0000
)
,
a
stone
building
at
East
Main
and
Spang
Streets
.

The
district
's
only
fully
extant
school
building
was
the
old
Junior-Senior
High
School
at
the
corner
of
Cemetery
and
Poplar
Streets
.

Partially
funded
by
the
Works
Progress
Administration
in
0000
,
this
three-story
brick
and
concrete
building
was
designed
in
the
Art
Moderne
mode
by
the
architect
Joseph
Hoover
,
a
native
of
the
town
.

It
was
demolished
in
0000
.

The
civic
center
of
the
borough
,
counted
as
one
of
three
contributing
sites
,
is
the
borough
park
with
its
duck
pond
and
fountain
designed
around
the
Big
Spring
.

The
present
park
,
which
Bare
set
aside
for
public
use
,
is
the
result
of
successive
improvement
projects
started
in
the
0000s
and
continuing
through
the
early
00th
century
.

A
stone
arch
,
counted
as
a
contributing
structure
,
was
built
in
0000
to
channel
the
spring
,
and
a
breast
dam
was
added
in
0000
to
impound
the
spring
water
into
a
pond
;
the
first
dam
was
replaced
by
the
present
steel
and
cement
dam
,
a
noncontributing
structure
,
in
0000
.

Sometime
in
the
0000s
to
0000s
,
the
pond
was
further
contained
by
a
concrete
basin
.

In
0000
,
the
Bare
Memorial
Fountain
,
counted
as
a
second
contributing
structure
,
with
its
oscillating
streams
and
colored
lights
was
added
.

The
two
other
contributing
sites
are
Greenlawn
Cemetery
and
Memorial
Park
.

Greenlawn
,
which
is
located
between
Cemetery
and
Girard
Streets
,
contains
many
of
the
town
's
founding
families
and
figures
including
D.
M.
Bare
.

Established
high
on
one
of
the
town
's
many
hillsides
,
the
cemetery
is
distinguished
by
its
scenic
vistas
.

Memorial
Park
,
located
at
Grove
and
Locust
Streets
,
was
set
aside
by
Bare
,
who
gave
the
land
to
the
school
district
in
0000
.

The
site
was
originally
called
Sugar
Grove
,
a
smaller
part
of
the
Spang
Farm
which
Bare
purchased
in
0000
.

Adjoining
the
Borough
Park
along
Spang
Street
stands
a
row
of
large
Victorian-era
homes
built
in
0000
for
D.
M.
Bare
and
members
of
his
family
.

These
are
substantial
yet
loosely
eclectic
variations
on
the
Queen
Anne
and
Gothic
Revival
styles
as
rendered
by
builders
from
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
.

Perhaps
the
most
impressive
is
the
Edwin
G.
Bobb
House
built
closest
to
the
park
by
a
son-in-law
of
D.
M.
Bare
.

The
rear
yard
of
the
house
is
the
approximate
former
site
of
the
George
B.
Spang
House
(
ca.
0000
)
,
the
home
of
the
miller
from
whom
D.
M.
Bare
purchased
the
Mill
Seat
Tract
in
0000
.

Spang
had
operated
the
gristmill
in
the
settlement
,
which
was
known
as
Spang
's
Mill
,
since
0000
.

His
homestead
now
stands
at
000
Church
Street
,
about
one
block
away
,
where
it
was
moved
in
0000
by
Bare
prior
to
construction
of
the
Bobb
House
.

The
Spang
House
is
a
typical
five-bay
,
double-pile
Georgian
type
dwelling
,
the
core
of
which
is
log
.

Besides
the
Spang
Street
manager
's
row
,
the
district
contains
two
other
large
landmark
houses
built
for
local
leaders
:
The
Dr.
W.
A.
Nason
House
built
ca.
0000
at
the
south
end
of
town
between
Locust
and
Oakmont
Place
,
and
the
Dr.
William
M.
Eldon
House
(
ca.
0000-0000
)
at
East
Main
and
Cemetery
Streets
.

Nason
established
a
large
private
hospital
that
stood
on
the
site
of
the
YMCA
between
0000
and
0000
.

His
house
is
a
boxy
three-story
Colonial
Revival
design
made
of
the
same
local
"
blue
"
limestone
as
the
Blank
Book
Company
office
(
see
below
)
.

Eldon
was
a
son-in-law
of
D.
M.
Bare
,
a
member
of
Dr.
Nason
's
hospital
staff
,
and
the
town
druggist
,
whose
former
store
at
E.
Main
Street
stands
next
door
to
the
Eldon
House
.

The
house
,
which
was
constructed
by
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
in
the
old
village
triangle
area
,
now
contains
apartments
and
an
attorney
's
office
.

Across
Spang
Street
overlooking
the
duck
pond
stands
the
Blank
Book
Company
,
an
ancillary
business
founded
by
Bare
in
0000
to
produce
ledgers
,
tablets
and
composition
books
from
the
mill
's
paper
stock
.

Practically
all
of
the
book
factory
complex
survives
,
including
the
impressive
three-story
Office
and
Warehouse
Building
(
0000
)
constructed
in
a
castellated
fashion
with
quarry-faced
ashlar
cut
from
local
"
blue
"
limestone
.

The
oldest
building
in
the
five-building
complex
is
the
two-story
brick
Binding
Building
(
0000
)
.

The
others
include
the
Printing
House
(
0000
)
,
a
three-story
brick
building
;
the
brick
Shipping
and
Stock
Room
Building
(
0000
)
at
three-stories
;
and
the
five-story
brick
Warehouse
built
in
0000
.

An
original
fire
station
is
located
in
the
yard
in
front
of
the
stone
Blank
Book
building
.

Also
adjoining
the
park
at
the
west
side
is
the
surviving
building
(
0000
)
from
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
Company
.

The
mill
supplied
finished
lumber
and
pre-fabricated
building
components
to
area
builders
,
and
is
credited
with
constructing
most
of
the
housing
and
other
buildings
in
Roaring
Spring
.

The
company
also
supplied
heating
coal
for
home
furnaces
.

Co-founded
in
0000
by
D.
M.
Bare
,
the
planing
mill
was
initially
owned
in
fourths
by
Bare
and
other
partners
.

Although
the
company
erected
dozens
of
houses
,
its
early
years
were
not
profitable
and
the
partnership
sold
out
to
D.
M.
Bare
&
Co.
in
0000
.

A
devastating
fire
in
0000
destroyed
the
original
0000
wood-frame
complex
.

The
present
building
,
a
one-story
brick
structure
with
gable
roof
,
dates
from
ca.
0000
and
replaced
one
of
the
originals
destroyed
by
fire
.

Three
or
four
other
mill
buildings
,
also
constructed
after
the
fire
,
have
since
been
demolished
and
an
open
lawn
planted
in
their
place
.

Between
0000
and
0000
,
the
Planing
Mill
Co.
erected
00
buildings
(
00
frame
and
00
brick
)
,
principally
houses
.

Extant
examples
of
its
work
include
many
of
the
borough
's
buildings
erected
between
0000
and
the
early
0000s
.

As
several
examples
,
the
earliest
homes
on
New
Street
,
between
Church
and
Lower
Streets
,
were
built
in
0000
by
the
Planing
Mill
.

The
remaining
building
now
houses
The
Roaring
Spring
Bottled
Water
company
store
.

Along
Main
Street
,
to
the
west
of
the
book
factory
and
park
,
stands
the
Roaring
Spring
Passenger
Station
(
ca.
0000
)
.

This
one-story
brick
building
with
hipped
roof
was
built
by
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
for
its
Morrisons
Cove
Branch
to
serve
the
paper
mill
.

Remarkably
,
it
is
the
only
historic
passenger
station
surviving
in
Blair
County
.

[
0
]
It
now
housed
the
historical
society
.

The
branch
line
remains
intact
and
is
used
weekly
for
freight
service
to
the
paper
mill
and
points
south
in
Morrisons
Cove
.

A
PRR
caboose
is
displayed
here
.

Architecturally
,
the
district
is
quite
intact
overall
.

Eight-seven
(
00
)
percent
of
the
district
's
000
properties
are
rated
as
contributing
.

The
remaining
00
percent
consist
of
buildings
less
than
00
years
old
or
those
few
older
buildings
whose
alterations
or
additions
have
destroyed
their
architectural
integrity
.

Approximately
00
percent
of
the
noncontributing
stock
consists
of
buildings
less
than
00
years
old
.

The
four
principal
noncontributing
buildings
in
the
district
are
the
Roaring
Spring
Bottling
Company
(
ca.
0000
)
located
on
West
Main
Street
behind
the
Blank
Book
Company
,
the
YMCA
building
(
0000
)
at
Grove
and
Main
Streets
,
the
Borough
Building
(
ca.
0000
)
at
Spang
,
Church
and
East
Main
Streets
,
and
the
former
Roaring
Spring
Department
Store
building
(
the
Company
Store
)
.

Although
the
core
of
the
store
dates
to
ca.
0000
,
successive
alterations
,
especially
in
0000
,
destroyed
the
integrity
of
the
building
.

The
paper
mill
complex
contains
just
two
small
historic
buildings
:
a
one-story
frame
maintenance
building
(
0000
)
and
a
two-story
brick-and-frame
clay
house
(
c.
0000
)
.

A
major
explosion
and
fire
in
0000
destroyed
many
of
the
older
buildings
.

The
mill
owners
have
since
demolished
many
others
over
the
years
to
upgrade
the
plant
.

Because
so
little
historic
fabric
survives
,
and
the
two
historic
buildings
are
not
visible
from
the
public
road
,
the
mill
complex
has
been
drawn
out
of
the
district
.

Only
one
important
contributing
resource
has
experienced
significant
contextual
change
:
the
area
around
the
planing
mill
building
,
which
was
surrounded
originally
by
other
mill
buildings
on
three
sides
,
has
been
cleared
for
a
lawn
and
parking
lot
as
part
of
the
borough
park
area
.

While
some
individual
buildings
have
undergone
contemporary
remodeling
,
the
district
retains
its
fundamental
architectural
integrity
.

As
is
common
to
this
region
,
many
wood-frame
buildings
have
been
sided
with
either
vinyl
or
aluminum
.

Some
houses
have
also
had
windows
replaced
with
modern
sash
,
resulting
in
some
loss
of
architectural
detail
.

A
much
smaller
number
have
had
their
original
sliding
sash
replaced
with
large
"
picture
"
windows
or
bay
windows
.

In
other
cases
,
Victorian-era
porch
posts
and
ornamental
details
like
brackets
have
been
replaced
with
simple
square
posts
or
iron
rod
supports
.

Some
roofs
,
which
originally
were
metal
(
either
raised
seam
,
corrugated
or
a
stamped
pattern
)
,
have
been
replaced
with
modern
composite
shingle
.

A
modest
number
of
these
early
00th
century
metal
surfaces
,
which
were
corrugated
or
stamped
pattern
,
survive
.

Original
slate
roofs
exist
in
more
significant
numbers
.

Perhaps
half
of
these
examples
have
been
covered
with
a
silver
paint
applied
as
a
sealant
and
heat
reflectant
.

Despite
the
results
of
contemporary
maintenance
,
a
large
majority
of
buildings
retain
many
other
significant
features
,
such
as
original
windows
,

Other
underlying
characteristics
,
such
as
building
scale
,
massing
,

and
site

,
remain
intact
as
well
.

Overall
,
most
of
the
common
renovations
,
such
as
modern

and
inappropriate
porch
posts
,
are
relatively
superficial
and
reversible
if

Significance
The
Roaring
Spring
Historic
District
is
locally
significant
in
the
areas
of
architecture
,
industry
and
social
history
as
an
excellent
example
of
a
paternally
founded
and
managed
paper-mill
town
in
central
Pennsylvania
,
one
whose
architecture
reflects
how
the
growth
of
a
hometown
,
family-owned
industry
stimulated
and
,
in
many
cases
,
directed
the
development
patterns
and
architectural
character
of
the
community
.

As
the
first
paper-mill
town
in
Blair
County
,
Roaring
Spring
played
an
important
role
in
establishing
a
small
regional
paper
industry
.

[

Only
two
other
paper
mills
have
operated
in
the
immediate
region
:
one
in
Tyrone
,
co-founded
by
D.
M.
Bare
in
0000
,
and
the
other
in
Williamsburg
started
in
0000
by
steel
magnate
Charles
Schwab
.

The
Borough
of
Roaring
Spring
and
its
paper
mill
were
essentially
the
creation
of
one
person
,
Daniel
Mathias
Bare
(
0000
–
0000
)
.

As
the
town
's
00th
year
history
noted
:
"
To
write
a
detailed
account
of
the
life
and
activities
of
Daniel
Mathias
Bare
is
practically
equivalent
to
writing
the
industrial
,
and
,
to
a
very
great
extent
,
the
institutional
history
of
Roaring
Spring
.

From
the
time
he
located
here
in
0000
until
the
time
of
his
death
he
was
pre-eminently
the
town
's
greatest
leader
,
occupying
the
foremost
ranks
of
those
who
promoted
its
industrial
,
commercial
and
religious
enterprises
.
"

[

]
Based
on
Bare
's
leadership
,
a
good
geographical
location
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
clean
water
,
the
town
became
a
successful
regional
producer
of
paper
and
related
products
from
0000
onward
.

Architecturally
,
the
commercial
,
industrial
,
institutional
,
and
residential
character
of
the
town
retains
an
integrity
that
accurately
conveys
the
developmental
evolution
of
the
community
between
0000
and
0000
.

Before
0000
,
Roaring
Spring
was
called
Spang
's
Mill
,
a
hamlet
in
Taylor
Township
situated
around
a
gristmill
operated
by
George
B.
Spang
.

[
00
]
The
area
was
patented
in
the
0000s
by
white
settlers
attracted
to
the
Big
Spring
,
an
eight-million-gallon-a-day
limestone
spring
that
emerges
from
a
hillside
in
the
center
of
town
.

At
least
as
early
as
the
0000s
,
a
gristmill
was
operated
here
by
a
German
Dunkard
named
Jacob
Neff
and
it
was
called
Neff
's
Mill
.

German
Dunkards
and
Scots-Irish
Presbyterians
were
the
predominant
pioneer
groups
in
Morrisons
Cove
during
the
late
00th
century
.

As
late
as
the
0000s
,
the
land
around
the
spring
had
probably
contained
a
village
of
Lenni
Lenape
Indians
.

[
00
]
Ironmaking
played
a
contributing
role
in
Spang
Mill
's
early
growth
,
especially
through
the
Civil
War
before
the
paper
mill
was
founded
.

The
village
stood
about
mid
course
between
a
large
iron
furnace
(
Martha
Furnace
)
at
McKee
's
Gap
to
the
north
and
an
iron-ore
quarry
to
the
south
at
Bloomfield
.

Teamsters
driving
the
ore
wagons
often
traded
at
the
gristmill
and
a
general
store
.

The
district
's
oldest
known
building
from
this
pre-paper
mill
era
is
the
Johannes
Lower
House
,
a
log
farmhouse
at
000
Bloomfield
St.
,
built
ca.
0000-00
.

Although
substantially
enlarged
and
covered
with
siding
,
the
south
half
of
the
structure
still
contains
the
original
house
.

At
the
time
,
Bloomfield
Street
was
a
country
road
leading
through
Morrisons
Cove
toward
McKee
's
Gap
.

D.
M.
Bare
moved
with
his
wife
to
Spang
's
Mill
in
0000
after
having
purchased
the
"
Mill
Seat
Tract
"
with
his
father
,
a
farmer
from
Sinking
Valley
in
Blair
County
,
north
of
Altoona
.

Attracted
to
the
location
because
of
the
spring
's
dependable
flow
and
superior
water
quality
,
Bare
initially
operated
the
gristmill
and
general
store
.

He
built
the
first
paper
mill
in
0000
with
two
partners
,
John
Eby
and
John
Morrison
,
but
a
disastrous
fire
destroyed
the
wood-frame
building
just
after
its
completion
.

The
three
men
rebuilt
on
the
site
almost
immediately
,
and
by
0000
were
in
business
again
,
establishing
a
trade
in
low-grade
paper
made
from
rag
,
gunny
sacking
and
straw
.

Through
the
rest
of
the
00th
century
,
the
mill
evolved
from
a
maker
of
manila
wrapping
paper
and
newspaper
to
a
manufacturer
of
fine
bond
by
the
late
0000s
.

The
Bares
had
three
daughters
,
all
of
whom
married
men
that
Bare
groomed
to
manage
various
aspects
of
the
family
business
.

In
time
,
all
three
—
Dr.
Abraham
L.
Garver
,
Edwin
G.
Bobb
and
Dr.
William
M.
Eldon
—
became
partners
and/or
managers
in
one
of
Bare
's
largely
family-controlled
companies
.

Throughout
his
working
life
,
Bare
retained
partners
in
most
of
his
business
ventures
,
although
he
appears
to
have
maintained
control
over
these
operations
either
through
intermediaries
or
family
members
.

The
paper
mill
was
incorporated
in
0000
and
the
Bare
family
retained
ownership
until
0000
when
the
business
was
sold
to
a
paper
company
from
Wisconsin
.

[
00
]
Since
0000
,
when
the
mill
began
operation
,
the
plant
has
been
expanded
or
substantially
retooled
at
least
nine
times
:
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
ca.
0000
,
0000
and
0000
,
according
to
the
town
's
centennial
history
.

In
0000
,
Bare
's
single
wood-frame
building
produced
.

of
paper
a
day
,
not
quite
one
ton
.

Two
years
later
,
a
boiler
explosion
forced
Bare
&
Co.
to
rebuild
,
converting
the
cotton
rag
mill
to
wood
pulp
production
.

A
second
paper
machine
was
added
in
0000
,
and
by
0000
production
had
increased
to
0
tons
a
day
.

A
third
machine
was
added
in
0000
,
and
in
0000
the
plant
was
completely
retooled
.

By
0000
,
following
the
installation
of
a
bleach-making
plant
and
the
reconstruction
of
the
steam-power
plant
,
output
averaged
nearly
00
tons
a
day
.

By
0000
,
production
had
increased
to
00
tons
a
day
and
the
mill
employed
000
people
.

[
00
]
Each
time
the
mill
expanded
or
retooled
,
older
outmoded
structures
were
demolished
and
new
ones
added
,
until
0000
when
a
major
explosion
destroyed
many
of
the
remaining
historic
buildings
.

D.
M.
Bare
's
influence
can
be
found
in
practically
every
aspect
of
town
life
:
out
of
his
general
store
in
0000
,
he
developed
a
department
store
which
became
known
as
"
the
company
store
;
"
,
now
Roaring
Spring
Department
Store
,
in
0000
,
he
co-sponsored
the
construction
of
the
first
Methodist
Church
;
from
0000
to
0000
,
he
served
as
one
of
the
first
postmasters
,
nominating
the
village
's
name
change
to
Roaring
Spring
in
0000
;
he
oversaw
the
creation
of
the
town
's
first
modern
utilities
,
including
the
telephone
system
(
0000
)
,
the
water
supply
(
0000
)
,
and
electrical
service
(
0000
)
.

The
paper
company
underwrote
the
cost
of
extending
a
line
from
Altoona
to
Roaring
Spring
where
the
first
telephone
was
installed
in
the
head
office
of
the
mill
.

In
a
desire
to
create
more
jobs
in
0000
,
Bare
co-founded
the
Roaring
Spring
Blank
Book
Company
,
which
became
a
primary
customer
for
his
paper
,
and
later
generated
electrical
current
for
residential
service
until
the
0000s
.

Bare
eventually
entrusted
the
operation
of
Blank
Book
to
his
son-in-law
,
Dr.
A.
L.
Garver
,
who
joined
the
company
at
its
founding
and
became
general
manager
by
0000
.

Garver
is
credited
with
building
Blank
Book
into
the
world
's
third
leading
maker
of
accounting
book
and
school
stationary
by
the
0000s
.

[
00
]
In
the
0000s
,
Bare
set
aside
land
for
the
town
's
first
public
parks
:
Memorial
Park
at
Grove
Street
and
the
Borough
Park
at
Spang
and
Spring
Streets
.

In
0000
,
he
founded
the
town
's
first
bank
,
and
through
the
0000-0000s
oversaw
the
brick
paving
of
many
public
streets
.

In
0000
,
he
co-founded
the
Eldon
Inn
with
his
three
sons-in-law
as
the
town
's
leading
hotel
for
business
travelers
.

Throughout
his
lifetime
here
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
Bare
is
credited
with
playing
many
other
informal
roles
to
help
organize
and
improve
the
community
life
of
the
town
.

Bare
played
his
most
substantial
role
in
shaping
the
architectural
character
of
the
town
through
co-founding
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
in
0000
.

Operated
as
a
heating
coal
and
building
supply
business
with
a
contracting
service
on
the
side
,
the
mill
is
credited
with
constructing
most
of
the
houses
and
other
buildings
of
note
in
Roaring
Spring
between
0000
and
the
early
0000s
.

While
the
company
records
have
been
lost
,
the
personal
records
of
David
S.
Smaltz
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
a
carpenter
who
worked
for
the
contracting
business
are
impressive
.

Smaltz
's
own
accounts
kept
by
the
family
in
the
0000s
recorded
that
between
0000
and
0000
he
helped
build
00
houses
on
Walnut
Street
,
00
houses
on
Roosevelt
Avenue
,
eight
houses
on
Church
Street
,
and
00
houses
on
New
Street
.

[
00
]
This
figure
of
000
is
bolstered
by
D.
M.
Bare
's
account
in
his
autobiography
where
he
stated
that
00
buildings
were
erected
by
the
planing
mill
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
construction
policies
and
practices
of
the
planing
mill
company
were
not
dictated
directly
by
Bare
,
but
through
a
partnership
,
as
most
of
his
business
operations
were
arranged
.

Nonetheless
,
there
appears
to
have
been
a
cohesive
similarity
of
architectural
taste
and
purpose
at
work
here
whose
basic
aesthetic
must
have
been
set
by
Bare
and
his
association
of
partners
,
managers
and
builders
.

Bare
also
may
be
credited
with
creating
the
town
's
first
subdivision
of
00
lots
in
0000
.

Given
the
extent
and
central
location
of
his
original
holding
from
the
Mill
Seat
Tract
,
and
the
fact
that
most
of
the
town
's
pre-0000
building
lots
are
to
,
Bare
's
ability
to
shape
the
size
and
extent
of
development
in
Roaring
Spring
was
substantial
.

The
planing
mill
's
most
active
periods
of
development
coincided
with
the
greatest
periods
of
expansion
for
the
paper
mill
and
book
company
.

As
new
jobs
were
created
,
the
population
grew
,
and
with
it
the
demand
for
more
housing
.

The
paper
mill
's
periods
of
expansion
(
within
the
period
of
significance
)
,
which
postdated
the
founding
of
the
planing
mill
,
were
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
0000
,
and
ca.
0000
.

During
that
same
general
period
,
the
town
's
population
more
than
tripled
from
000
to
just
over
0,000
between
0000
and
0000
.

[
00
]
The
influence
of
Bare
and
his
family
over
the
development
and
affairs
of
one
town
is
rather
remarkable
for
this
region
.

Only
two
comparative
community
models
come
to
mind
in
southwestern
Pennsylvania
:
the
brick
refractories
towns
and
coal
mining
towns
.

Alexandria
and
Mount
Union
,
both
in
neighboring
Huntingdon
County
,
were
shaped
in
varying
degrees
by
the
refractories
industry
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Both
witnessed
the
construction
of
worker
housing
in
the
0000s
that
was
financed
either
directly
by
or
independently
of
the
industry
.

Beyond
that
,
however
,
few
across
the
board
generalizations
can
be
made
regarding
the
industry
's
architectural
impact
on
these
communities
,
or
others
like
them
in
the
region
.

Some
brick
manufacturers
were
indeed
family-owned
and
operated
,
while
many
others
were
divisions
of
larger
corporations
.

Some
built
whole
blocks
of
company
housing
,
as
in
Mount
Union
,
while
others
only
dabbled
in
development
,
allowing
local
builders
to
meet
the
demand
,
as
in
Alexandria
.

Some
housing
resembled
military
barracks
,
as
in
the
semi-detached
houses
of
Mount
Union
,
while
others
built
single-family
houses
,
as
in
South
Alexandria
.

[
00
]
The
other
comparable
regional
model
is
the
coal
company
town
.

Here
everything
was
built
following
a
company
engineer
's
formula
—
from
street
layout
to
house
plan
—
and
most
every
structure
reflected
a
hierarchy
of
design
.

Roaring
Spring
,
by
contrast
,
contains
few
,
if
any
,
of
the
coal
company
town
's
typical
two-story
semi-detached
frame
dwellings
that
fill
the
checkerboard
streets
of
places
like
Colver
(
est.
0000s
)
in
Cambria
County
or
Windber
(
est.
0000s
)
in
Somerset
County
.

[
00
]
And
while
Roaring
Spring
's
patriarchal
management
may
have
desired
orderly
community
development
,
it
did
not
impose
a
blatantly
class-structured
environment
on
its
work
force
.

One
other
comparative
,
if
exceptional
,
community
exists
in
the
immediate
region
:
The
borough
of
Kistler
,
was
built
as
a
model
workers
'
town
in
Mifflin
County
by
a
Mount
Union
refractories
company
.

Located
just
over
the
Juniata
River
from
Mount
Union
,
Kistler
was
designed
in
0000-00
by
John
Nolen
,
a
noted
town
planner
from
Cambridge
,
Massachusetts
.

The
president
of
the
Mount
Union
Refractories
hired
Nolen
to
create
a
model
town
,
apparently
inspired
by
the
Progressive
Era
notion
that
superior
housing
and
other
community
amenities
designed
under
a
master
plan
would
improve
the
moral
character
of
its
inhabitants
.

[
00
]
But
in
its
architecture
and
layout
,
Roaring
Spring
resembles
neither
a
company
town
nor
a
model
workers
community
.

Unlike
coal
company
towns
,
Roaring
Spring
possesses
a
relatively
wide
variety
of
housing
types
without
a
hierarchical
town
plan
,
and
unlike
a
model
community
like
Kistler
,
no
master
plan
appears
at
work
like
a
template
beneath
the
townscape
.

Instead
,
Roaring
Spring
's
street
pattern
evolved
episodically
from
a
combination
of
natural
topography
,
pre-existing
land
tracts
,
and
the
confluence
of
old
country
roads
at
the
Big
Spring
.

Architecturally
,
Roaring
Spring
's
neighborhoods
display
relatively
little
hierarchy
by
income
or
occupation
.

Admittedly
,
some
areas
,
like
the
Hogback
just
south
of
the
paper
mill
,
were
especially
known
as
mill
workers
'
enclaves
,
but
overall
the
town
lacks
the
strong
homogeneity
of
worker
house
types
and
segmentation
by
occupational
class
common
to
coal
company
towns
.

D.
M.
Bare
and
his
cohorts
seemed
to
have
envisioned
Roaring
Spring
as
a
working
community
of
middle-class
homeowners
plucked
from
the
ranks
of
shopkeepers
,
professionals
and
skilled
workers
.

The
relative
success
of
this
ideal
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
large
number
of
skilled
workers
required
for
paper
and
book-making
.

These
workers
,
their
supervisors
and
the
office
staffs
earned
wages
high
enough
to
become
property
owners
over
time
.

Indeed
,
one
of
the
achievements
that
D.
M.
Bare
mentioned
with
pride
in
his
autobiography
was
the
high
degree
of
home
ownership
that
Roaring
Spring
enjoyed
by
0000
.

Although
this
egalitarian
vision
was
carried
out
largely
from
a
patriarchal
vantage
,
its
ideal
is
reflected
in
the
general
uniformity
of
lot
sizes
through
the
historic
district
.

Each
lot
is
just
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
single-family
home
with
room
for
a
vegetable
garden
and
garage
in
the
rear
.

Most
houses
are
sited
toward
the
front
of
their
lots
with
modest
front
yards
and
deep
backyards
.

Earlier
houses
,
built
along
the
older
streets
like
Main
and
Spang
,
follow
the
traditional
regional
pattern
of
being
situated
close
to
the
front
lot
line
;
later
houses
,
built
after
0000
,
are
situated
slightly
back
.

The
exceptions
to
this
rule
are
the
five
generous
house
sites
next
to
the
spring
on
Spang
Street
that
were
set
aside
by
Bare
for
his
family
.

By
local
standards
,
these
were
palatial
houses
set
on
deep
lots
of
with
relatively
expansive
wooded
lawns
.

Unlike
heavier
industrial
centers
in
the
greater
region
,
such
as
Johnstown
and
Pittsburgh
,
Roaring
Spring
's
population
had
remained
relatively
homogeneous
in
ethnic
,
racial
and
political
terms
,
a
historical
factor
that
reinforced
the
outward
social
cohesiveness
of
the
community
.

During
the
early
decades
of
the
00th
century
,
as
the
nation
experienced
large
waves
of
immigration
from
eastern
and
southern
Europe
,
the
town
remained
primarily
old-stock
Protestant
descendants
of
Germans
and
Scotch
Irish
.

It
also
failed
to
experience
the
great
northern
migration
of
African
Americans
from
the
South
looking
for
factory
jobs
after
the
Second
World
War
.

Roman
Catholics
were
the
last
major
mainstream
denomination
to
establish
a
congregation
in
Roaring
Spring
.

Prior
to
0000
,
most
local
Roman
Catholics
worshipped
at
St.
Patrick
's
in
Newry
,
an
Irish-founded
parish
about
away
.

The
town
has
also
remained
true
to
the
temperance
movement
as
championed
by
D.
M.
Bare
from
his
earliest
days
.

Under
the
Bare
family
influence
,
the
town
went
dry
in
the
0000s
and
remains
so
today
,
as
does
all
of
the
Morrisons
Cove
valley
.

It
is
also
revealing
that
while
the
paper
mill
was
family
owned
,
local
labor
unions
were
practically
nonexistent
.

The
first
union
local
—
United
Brotherhood
of
Pulp
and
Sulphite
Workers
(
AFL
)
—
was
not
organized
until
0000
.

Most
of
Roaring
Spring
's
architecture
belongs
to
a
nationally
common
set
of
styles
and
types
influenced
by
the
rise
of
the
railroad
after
0000
.

The
Pennsylvania
Railroad
's
connection
to
the
town
in
0000
had
a
significant
effect
on
this
development
by
drawing
the
paper
mill
,
and
with
it
the
village
,
into
the
mainstream
of
national
commerce
.

The
railroad
opened
national
markets
to
the
paper
mill
,
allowing
its
business
to
expand
beyond
a
narrow
regional
scope
.

By
the
mid-00th
century
,
as
Roaring
Spring
was
first
growing
,
the
regional
peculiarities
of
folk
architecture
were
gradually
disappearing
under
the
railroad
's
and
the
industrial
revolution
's
influences
.

As
the
town
grew
with
the
paper
mill
,
especially
after
the
P.R.R.
's
branch
line
opened
,
the
new
housing
styles
reflected
national
trends
rather
than
local
vernacular
traditions
.

Roaring
Spring
can
be
compared
in
this
regard
with
the
only
other
paper-mill
towns
in
the
region
:
Tyrone
and
Williamsburg
,
both
in
Blair
County
.

Tyrone
,
which
is
located
on
the
Juniata
River
above
Altoona
,
was
fairly
well
established
by
0000
when
D.
M.
Bare
co-founded
a
paper
mill
there
.

The
new
worker
housing
built
from
that
year
forward
took
on
the
same
architectural
character
as
Roaring
Spring
's
after
0000
.

Williamsburg
had
originated
as
an
0000s
canal
town
on
another
branch
of
the
Juniata
northeast
of
Hollidaysburg
.

In
0000
,
its
community
leaders
persuaded
former
native
and
steel
tycoon
Charles
Schwab
to
build
a
large
paper
mill
.

Williamsburg
's
post-0000
development
thereafter
came
to
resemble
Roaring
Spring
's
in
style
and
type
.

The
construction
of
comfortable
single-family
houses
became
quite
common
,
especially
Foursquares
and
large
Gable
Front
types
.

These
two
examples
suggest
that
the
region
's
paper
industry
offered
skilled
workers
'
wages
sufficient
to
support
home
ownership
,
and
that
local
builders
'
housing
styles
in
central
Pennsylvania
were
already
homogeneous
by
the
0000s
.

One
of
the
exceptions
to
this
national
trend
is
the
Mennonite
meeting
house
,
originally
built
for
the
Methodist
Episcopal
congregation
in
0000
.

The
term
"
meeting
house
"
is
appropriate
for
this
building
,
which
bears
none
of
the
vaguely
Gothic
effects
of
most
post-Civil
War
American
churches
.

Rather
,
it
is
a
regional
throwback
—
an
unadorned
house-like
structure
common
to
early
00th
century
central
Pennsylvania
when
new
congregations
often
first
met
in
private
homes
before
building
simple
meeting
houses
as
their
first
church
.

The
Methodists
were
the
first
organized
denomination
(
0000
)
in
Roaring
Spring
,
and
this
building
was
the
town
's
first
house
of
worship
.

The
builder
,
the
Rev.
John
A.
J.
Williams
(
0000
–
0000
)
,
was
a
Methodist
minister
by
calling
and
a
carpenter
by
trade
,
who
moved
to
Roaring
Spring
after
the
Civil
War
.

One
of
the
borough
's
early
leading
citizens
,
he
is
credited
with
building
many
pre-0000
structures
in
Roaring
Spring
before
the
Roaring
Spring
Planing
Mill
's
founding
,
including
a
number
of
houses
on
the
south
side
of
E.
Main
Street
between
Spang
and
Poplar
Streets
.

Master
builders
and
carpenters
like
Williams
,
guided
by
patrons
like
D.H.
Bare
who
also
helped
underwrite
the
Methodist
church
,
determined
the
look
of
Roaring
Spring
's
architecture
rather
than
professional
architects
.

The
builders
,
in
most
cases
,
were
not
design
innovators
but
craftsmen
who
adapted
plans
from
myriad
national
sources
such
as
catalogs
,
pattern
books
,
magazines
,
mail-order
services
,
lumberyard
fliers
,
and
trade
literature
.

While
pattern
books
had
been
available
to
American
builders
as
early
as
the
00th
century
,
mail-order
design
services
became
nationally
common
by
the
0000s
.

Along
with
the
influence
of
the
railroad
and
mass-circulation
magazines
,
all
of
these
homogenizing
influences
contributed
to
the
decline
of
regional
vernacular
architecture
and
the
spread
of
nationally
accepted
styles
.

Significantly
,
many
of
these
sources
targeted
conservative
markets
,
promoting
traditional
designs
that
appealed
to
small-town
America
.

As
one
example
of
this
phenomenon
,
many
of
the
houses
in
Roaring
Spring
built
around
the
start
of
the
00th
century
appear
to
be
older
Victorian
types
,
such
as
many
Gothic
Revivals
models
of
the
era
which
are
really
double-pile
Georgian
types
in
plan
.

Presumably
,
this
conservative
impulse
was
of
small
concern
to
the
first
owners
who
paid
little
attention
to
"
high
style
"
design
trends
.

What
most
homeowners
looked
for
in
a
house
was
comfort
,
serviceability
,
and
an
acceptable
level
of
appeal
conforming
with
their
community
's
taste
.

Quite
often
,
the
local
distributor
of
trade
literature
and
new
construction
trends
in
a
small
town
was
the
neighborhood
building
supply
center
.

In
Roaring
Spring
,
as
in
many
regional
towns
and
cities
,
the
planing
mill
fulfilled
that
function
.

As
a
result
,
the
importance
of
planing
mills
like
Roaring
Spring
's
in
shaping
the
architectural
character
of
communities
in
this
region
can
not
be
overstated
.

These
operations
supported
builders
by
providing
not
only
design
plans
and
new
ideas
,
but
finished
lumber
,
paint
,
roofing
materials
,
and
pre-fabricated
components
like
windows
,
doors
and
molding
for
thousands
of
construction
projects
throughout
the
region
.

As
the
critical
link
in
the
local
building
industry
,
they
have
helped
set
the
style
for
communities
throughout
central
Pennsylvania
from
the
beginning
of
the
railroad
era
in
the
0000s
to
the
present
.

In
summary
,
Roaring
Spring
stands
as
an
excellent
example
of
a
paternally
founded
and
managed
paper-mill
town
in
central
Pennsylvania
,
one
whose
buildings
reflect
how
the
growth
of
a
hometown
family-owned
industry
stimulated
and
,
in
many
cases
,
directed
the
development
patterns
and
architectural
character
of
the
community
.

Architecturally
,
the
commercial
,
industrial
,
institutional
,
and
residential
character
of
Roaring
Spring
town
retains
an
integrity
that
accurately
conveys
the
developmental
evolution
of
the
community
between
0000
and
0000
.

The
themes
of
Industry
,
Architecture
and
Social
History

Roaring
Spring
an
excellent

of
a
locally
significant
historic

History
In
May
0000
,
a
Waverly
banker
named
Howard
Elmer
,
along
with
Charles
Anthony
and
James
Fritcher
,
bought
the
Pine
Plains
area
between
Waverly
and

.

Elmer
convinced
Asa
Packer
to
locate
a
new
railroad
repair
facility
on
the
Pine
Plains
for
the
expanding
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
,
which
was
making
a
push
north
to
connect
to
the
Erie
railroad
at
Waverly
,
NY
.

Robert
Heysham
Sayre
,
President
of
the
Pennsylvania

Railroad
,
helped
cement
the
deal
.

The
town
was
named
in
his
honor
.

Sayre
was
incorporated
on
January

,
0000
.

In
0000
when
the

shops
were
built
at

,
the
main
shop
building
was
believed
to
be
the
largest
structure
in
the
world
under
one
roof
,
it
held
that
title
for
only
a
brief
time
however
.

The
railroad
operated
from
0000
until
0000
,
but
maintenance
facilities
were
shifted
away
before
that
.

With
the
decline
of
industry
,
population
has
declined
since
0000
.

when

bought
tracts

moved
into
a
forested
wilderness
from

homes
.

The

Parley
Coburn
represented
the
company
's
interests
for

years

death
in

.

He
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
at
his
death
he
had
finally
sold
the
last
of
the
lots
.

It
had
been
a
difficult
task
because
money
was
scarce
,
the
original
lot
prices
were
high
,
and
developing
a
living
from
the
earth
was
difficult
.

In
some
instances
,
Brown
&
Ives
held
mortgages
into
the
0rd
generation
of
a
family
on

land

a
borough
in
Bradford
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United

.

The
population
was

at
the
0000
census
.

History
The
history
of
Wyalusing
dates
back
centuries
and
was
originally
known
as
M'chwihilusing
.

Before
0000
the
settlement
was
known
as
Gahontoto
and
was
home
to
the
native
American
tribe
the
Tehotachsee
.

This
small
tribe
would
eventually
be
completely
wiped
out
by
the
Cayuga
tribe
.

In
0000
the
chief
of
the
Cayugas
and
about
00
other
families
rebuilt
the
town
.

In
the
00th
century
is
when
the
town
really
began
to
prosper
with
Wyalusing
becoming
a
shipping
area
for
logs
and
other
items
on
the
Susquehanna
River
.

In
0000
the
construction
of
the
Welles
Mill
along
the
Wyalusing
Creek
made
Wyalusing
a
prime
area
for
people
to
farm
and
raise
crops
.

In
0000
Wyalusing
officially
became
a
borough
of
Pennsylvania
.

Many
of
the
buildings
were
built
in
the
late
00th
century
and
early
0000s
still
are
part
of
Main
Street
today
.

Wyalusing
is
also
home
to
one
of
the
biggest
beef
processing
plants
on
the
east
coast
.

Cargill
regional
beef
Wyalusing
is
located
just
a
couple
miles
outside
of
town
.

This
plant
was
originally
started
in
the
late
0000s
by
the
local
Taylor
family
as
a
small
local
meat
processing
plant
.

It
eventually
grew
into
a
multi
million
dollar
business
that
employs
over
0000
people
from
the
surrounding
area
.

Cargill
is
one
of
the
biggest
suppliers
of
ground
beef
to
large
grocery
chains
such
as
Wegmans
,
Giant
,
Shop
Rite
and
more
.

In
0000
the
Taylor
family
sold
the
business
to
the
Cargill
corporation
which
is
one
of
the
largest
privately
owned
companies
in
the
United
States
.

The
Wyalusing
Path

a
historical

that

Bridgeton
Township
is
a
township
in
Bucks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
United
States
.

The
population
was
0,000
at
the
0000
census
.

The
township
was
originally
a
part
of
adjacent
Nockamixon
Township
,
but
a
division
was
arranged
and
signed
on
0000
.

This
accord
split
an
area
of
Nockamixon
which
ran
west
from
the
banks
of
the
Delaware
River
to
about
one
third
the
breadth
of
the
original
township
.

This
smaller
area
was
unsurprisingly
named
"
Bridgeton
"
,
as
it
was
the
site
of
wooden
truss
bridge
which
connected
the
towns
of
Upper
Black
Eddy
and
Milford
,
New
Jersey
.

The
township
originally
contained
several
tiny
hamlets
,
such
as
the
aforementioned
Upper
Black
Eddy
,
Narrowsville
,
and
Ruppsville
.

Upper
Black
's
Eddy
,
as
it
was
originally
called
,
and
Raubsville
were
named
for
notable
landholders
,
while
Narrowsville
was
named
for
a
particularly
thin
portion
of
the
Delaware
river
.

With
the
construction
of
a
centralized
post
office
in
Upper
Black
Eddy
,
the
usage
of
separate
names
for
the
smaller
towns
ceased
in
an
official
capacity
,
and
the
everyday
errands
of
residents
became
centered
around
the
largest
of
the
towns
.

What
little
commercial
trade
exists
in
the
township
is
now
centered
solely
in
Upper
Black
Eddy
,
with
any
evidence
of
there
being
any
distinctive
,
smaller
villages
existing
only
on
outdated
road-signs
and
maps
.

Ringing
Rocks
Park
is
located
within
the
township
,
as
well
as
state
game
hunting
lands
.

Bridgeton
Township
is
also
home
to
the
Homestead
General
Store
,
the
oldest
continually
operating
general
store
on
the
Delaware
Canal
.

It
is
also
home
to
Homestead
Coffee
Roasters
,
an
artisan
coffee
roaster
specializing
in
organic
and
fair
trade
coffee
.

Downtown
Chalfont
Downtown
Chalfont
is
a
quaint
area
with
many
Victorian
buildings
.

This
formerly
residential
area
is
now
home
to
many
local
businesses
and
restaurants
.

The
Historic
District
The
Historic
district
of
Chalfont
includes
St.
James
Church
,
built
in
0000
,
and
a
number
of
Victorian
and
Second
Empire
style
homes
of
various
colors
,
although
some
of
these
homes
have
been
converted
into
businesses
.

Also
a
part
of
the
town
is
the
local
Chalfont
train
station
,
part
of
the
Lansdale/Doylestown
Line
train
line
and
the
Fire-House
,
constructed
in
the
early
00th
century
.

Churches
Chalfont
welcomes
members
of
all
religious
beliefs
but
the
churches
of
the
town
represent
only
the
Christian
faith
.

Churches
include
the
historic
St.
James
Lutheran
Church
,
which
has
since
been
vacant
since
a
split
in
the
parish
.

It
was
organized
in
0000
and
grew
in
size
in
the
0000s
.

There
is
also
the
much
newer
Chalfont
United
Methodist
Church
.

The
original
Methodist
church
was
built
in
0000
,
however
as
the
Christian
community
grew
,
improvements
were
made
to
the
building
and
later
in
0000s
and
0000s
,
the
church
moved
to
various
buildings
.

The
Catholic
Community
is
represented
in
the
St.
Jude
Roman
Catholic
Church
,
located
on
Rte
000
.

The
church
building
,
itself
,
was
built
during
the
latter
half
of
the
00th
century
and
the
extensive
grounds
also
include
a
school
for
grades
Pre-K
to
0th
grade
.

In
0000
,
a
fire
burnt
down
the
church
due
to
negligence
with
the
candles
.

Since
then
,
a
new
church
has
been
built
as
well
as
an
addition
to
the
school
.

Also
on
the
grounds
is
the
original
farmhouse
,
which
was
converted
into
a
rectory
and
has
been
put
to
various
other
uses
over
the
years
since
another
new
rectory
was
built
to
replace
it
.

However
,
the
building
has
been
named
The
Father
Gregg
Center
in
honor
of
the
priest
who
had
overseen
the
conversion
of
the
farmhouse
into
a
rectory
.

The
grounds
also
feature
the
school
,
rectory
,
playground
,
and
playing
fields
.

History
Originally
,
the
Lenape
Indians
dwelt
in
present
day
Chalfont
.

In
0000
,
William
Penn
signed
a
treaty
with
the
local
chief
and
parceled
the
land
to
the
Free
Society
of
Traders
.

In
0000
,
Simon
Butler
bought
over
000
acres
of
land
,
including
the
"
Village
of
Chalfont
.
"

After
the
construction
of
his
home
and
mill
,
Butler
bought
more
than
000
more
acres
of
land
.

Butler
was
a
giant
historical
figure
who
acted
as
a
legal
and
economic
powerhouse
in
the
area
.

After
his
death
,
the
land
was
parceled
to
a
number
of
people
.

Since
then
and
0000
,
Chalfont
has
been
named
a
number
of
things
including
Butler
's
Mill
,
Kungle
's
Tavern
,
Barndtsville
,
and
Whitehallville
.

For
many
years
,
the
most
important
building
in
the
area
was
the
tavern
and
public
house
,
which
has
burnt
down
many
times
and
now
stands
as
Borghi
's
Restaurant
.

During
the
Victorian
era
,
a
train-station
was
built
which
helped
the
community
grow
and
brought
about
the
construction
of
the
many
Victorian
houses
.

In
0000
,
Chalfont
established
Forest
Park
.

Forest
park
started
out
as
a
small
picnic
ground
where
music
could
be
played
.

The
appearance
of
the
train
station
in
Chalfont
assured
the
park
's
success
.

However
,
as
the
park
grew
it
became
a
small
amusement
park
where
local
people
could
enjoy
rides
,
a
large
swimming
pool
built
in
the
'00s
,
music
(
including
string
bands
in
the
'00s
)
and
as
the
hosting
ground
for
many
company
picnics
.

The
park
closed
its
doors
forever
in

Scandals
In
September
0000
,
Police
Officer
Jon
Knight
was
arrested
for
obstructing
the
administration
of
law
and
hindering
prosecution
.

Knight
allegedly
tipped
off
a
local
citizen
to
an
ongoing
narcotics
investigation
.

Knight
was
subsequently
acquitted
of
the
charges
;
however
he
was
fired
from
the
Police
Department
.

Knight
lost
a
fight
in
arbitration
to
be
reinstated
,
and
took
his
fight
to
the
courts
.

In
0000
,
it
came
to
light
that
Borough
Manager
David
Drye
had
outstanding
warrants
for
his
arrest
in
Arizona
.

Drye
was
hired
by
the
borough
in
0000
before
his
past
weapons
,
drug
,
and
theft
charges
were
recognized
.

Drye
claimed
the
borough
knew
about
his
past
.

Borough
Council
denied
this
.

In
0000
,
Councilman
Bill
Kuder
was
arrested
and
convicted
of
molesting
a
minor
boy
.

Kuder
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
prison
.

Kuder
remained
on
the
ballot
for
the
0000
election
and
while
he
did
not
win
,
he
did
beat
opponents
such
as
Mitch
Meyerson
.

On
August
00
,
0000
,
Police
Officer
Jon
Cousin
reported
that
he
had
been
shot
in
the
chest
while
investigating
a
suspicious
vehicle
.

The
following
day
,
Officer
Cousin
was
arrested
by
the
Bucks
County
District
Attorney
's
office
for
filing
a
false
police
report
,
reckless
endangerment
and
official
suppression
.

The
District
Attorney
claims
the
incident
was
a
hoax
,
and
that
the
evidence
shows
that
Cousin
was
not
shot
.

In
fact
,
Cousin
used
his
personal
gun
to
shoot
the
vest
at
a
different
location
,
and
then
fired
his
service
pistol
three
times
to
claim
he
returned
fire
on
the
suspects
.

Ballistic
evidence
,
witness
testimony
,
and
evidence
at
the
scene
was
used
.

In
November
0000
,
Cousin
plead
guilty
to
official
suppression
and
making
false
reports
to
the
police
.

During
his
court
hearing
,
it
became
public
that
Cousin
considered
his
best
day
as
a
police
officer
,
the
day
that
he
used
excessive
force
in
extricating
a
man
from
a
burning
house
.

It
also
became
clear
that
in
the
weeks
leading
up
to
the
incident
,
Cousin
reported
several
times
that
he
was
being
shot
at
or
had
witnessed
shots
occurring
.

All
of
these
reports
were
unfounded
,
yet
he
continued
to
patrol
the
Borough
unchecked
.

Jon
Cousin
is
currently
out
on
bail
and
faces
more
than
two
years
in
prison
.

Passenger

History
Churchville
's
population
boom
and
growth
as
a
commuter
haven
took
place
in
the
mid-0000s
,
just
after
the
town
lost
it
commuter
railway
line
.

Trains
served
the
town
until
January
00
,
0000
via
SEPTA
's
Fox
Chase-Newtown
Rapid
Transit
Line
.

The
station
,
and
all
of
those
north
of
Fox
Chase
,
were
closed
due
to
failing
diesel
train
equipment
that
the
then-cash-strapped
SEPTA
could
not
afford
to
rehabilitate
.

As
a
result
,
ridership
was
low
and
the
service
cancelled
on
a
"
temporary
"
basis
.

As
such
,
Churchville
Station
still
appears
in
SEPTA
's
publicly
posted
tariffs
.

Although
rail
service
was
initially
replaced
with
a
Fox
Chase-Newtown
shuttle
bus
,
patronage
remained
light
.

The
traveling
public
never
saw
a
bus
service
as
a
suitable
replacement
for
a
rail
service
,
and
the
Fox
Chase-Newtown
shuttle
bus
service
ended
in
0000
.

The
Churchville
Historic
District
was
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
in
0000
.

Resumption
of
passenger
train
service
In
the
ensuing
years
since
0000
,
there
has
been
heavy
interest
by
both
residents
and
politicians
in
resuming
passenger
service
to
Churchville
.

In
September
0000
,
the
Southampton-based
Pennsylvania
Transit
Expansion
Coalition
(
PA-TEC
)
began
discussions
with
township
officials
along
the
railway
,
as
well
as
SEPTA
officials
,
about
the
realistic
possibility
of
resuming
even
minimal
passenger
service
to
relieve
traffic
congestion
in
the
region
.

Plans
call
for
completing
the
electrification
to
Newtown
,
as
originally
planned
in
the
late
0000s
.

PA-TEC
's
efforts
have
received
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
by
both
Bucks
and
Montgomery
County
officials
,
as
well
as
at
the
state
level
,
despite
SEPTA
's
overall
reservations
.

However
,
SEPTA
has
also
confirmed
they
are
willing
to
reestablish
regular
commuter
service
if
strong
political
support
exists
in
both
counties
.

Doylestown
is
a
borough
in
Bucks
County
,
Pennsylvania
,
north
of
Philadelphia
.

As
of
the
0000
census
,
the
borough
population
was
0,000
.

The
borough
is
the
county
seat
of
Bucks
County
.

History
Doylestown
's
origins
date
to
0000
when
William
Doyle
obtained
a
license
to
build
a
tavern
on
what
is
now
the
northwest
corner
of
Main
and
State
Street
.

Known
for
years
as
"
William
Doyle
's
Tavern
"
,
its
strategic
location
at
the
intersection
of
the
road
linking
Swede
's
Ford
(
Norristown
)
and
Coryell
's
Ferry
(
New
Hope
)
(
now
U.S.
Route
000
)
and
the
road
linking
Philadelphia
and
Easton
(
now
PA
Route
000
)
-
allowed
the
hamlet
to
blossom
into
a
village
.

The
first
church
was
erected
in
0000
,
followed
by
the
establishment
of
a
succession
of
congregations
throughout
the
00th
century
.

During
the
first
decade
of
the
00th
century
discontent
developed
with
the
location
of
the
county
seat
for
Bucks
County
because
Newtown
was
not
a
central
location
.

The
more
centrally
located
Doylestown
became
the
county
seat
in
0000
.

An
outgrowth
of
Doylestown
's
new
courthouse
was
the
development
of
"
lawyers
row
"
,
a
collection
of
Federal-style
offices
.

One
positive
consequence
of
early
00th
century
investment
in
the
new
county
seat
was
organized
fire
protection
,
which
began
in
0000
with
the
Doylestown
Fire
Engine
Company
.

In
0000
the
Borough
of
Doylestown
was
incorporated
.

An
electric
telegraph
station
was
built
in
0000
and
in
0000
a
branch
of
the
North
Pennsylvania
Railroad
was
completed
to
Doylestown
.

The
first
gas
lights
were
introduced
in
0000
.

Because
of
the
town
's
relatively
high
elevation
and
a
lack
of
strong
water
power
,
substantial
industrial
development
never
occurred
and
Doylestown
evolved
to
have
a
professional
and
residential
character
.

During
the
mid-nineteenth
century
several
large
tracts
located
east
of
the
courthouse
area
were
subdivided
into
neighborhoods
.

The
next
significant
wave
of
development
occurred
after
the
Civil
War
when
the
Magill
property
to
the
southwest
of
the
town
's
core
was
subdivided
for
residential
lots
.

In
0000
Doylestown
established
a
water
works
.

The
first
telephone
line
arrived
in
0000
,
the
same
year
that
a
new
courthouse
was
erected
.

0000
saw
the
first
of
several
trolley
lines
connecting
Doylestown
with
Willow
Grove
,
Newtown
and
Easton
beginning
operation
.

A
private
sewer
system
and
treatment
plant
was
authorized
in
0000
.

The
Borough
took
over
and
expanded
sewer
service
to
about
three-quarters
of
the
town
in
0000
.

In
the
early
00th
century
,
Doylestown
became
best
known
to
the
outside
world
through
the
"
Tools
of
the
Nation-Maker
"
museum
of
the
Bucks
County
Historical
Society
.

Henry
Chapman
Mercer
constructed
the
reinforced
poured
concrete
building
in
0000
to
house
his
collection
of
mechanical
tools
and
utensils
.

Upon
his
death
in
0000
,
Mercer
also
left
his
similarly
constructed
home
Fonthill
and
adjacent
"
Moravian
Pottery
and
Tile
Works
"
,
to
be
operated
as
a
museum
.

The
home
was
left
on
the
condition
that
his
housekeeper
be
allowed
to
live
there
for
the
rest
of
her
life
.

She
lived
there
and
gave
tours
until
the
mid
nineteen-seventies
.

By
0000
,
the
advent
of
the
automobile
and
improved
highway
service
had
put
the
last
trolley
line
out
of
business
and
Doylestonians
were
forced
to
embrace
the
automobile
as
the
primary
means
of
travel
within
the
region
.

The
Great
Depression
took
its
toll
,
as
many
grand
old
houses
constructed
a
century
earlier
fell
into
disrepair
.

During
the
0000s
,
the
Borough
also
expanded
its
land
area
to
the
north
by
admission
of
the
tract
known
as
the
Doylestown
Annex
.

In
the
decade
following
World
War
II
,
Doylestown
's
business
community
boomed
.

During
the
0000s
,
streets
were
paved
for
the
first
time
in
two
decades
and
parking
meters
were
introduced
downtown
in
0000
.

However
,
the
Borough
's
post-war
housing
boom
did
not
begin
in
earnest
until
the
0000s
,
when
000
new
homes
were
built
.

This
housing
boom
continued
into
the
0000s
and
0000s
,
as
more
than
0,000
new
homes
were
built
during
those
decades
and
the
Borough
's
population
grew
from
0,000
in
0000
to
0,000
in
0000
.

As
with
many
small
towns
across
the
country
,
the
growth
of
the
post
war
decades
also
brought
a
new
competitor
to
the
downtown
business
district
—
the
shopping
mall
.

By
the
0000s
,
the
toll
could
be
seen
in
Doylestown
by
the
numerous
vacant
buildings
and
dilapidated
storefronts
in
the
center
of
town
.

The
Bucks
County
Redevelopment
Authority
responded
with
a
federal
urban
renewal
scheme
that
called
for
the
demolition
of
00
historic
buildings
.

The
local
business
community
objected
to
such
wholesale
clearance
and
responded
with
its
own
plan
called
Operation
'
00
—
the
Doylestown
Plan
for
Self-Help
Downtown
Renewal
.

This
private
initiative
was
successful
in
saving
Doylestown
's
old
buildings
and
historic
character
,
while
improving
business
at
the
same
time
.

One
historic
landmark
that
could
not
be
saved
was
the
00-year-old
courthouse
and
clock
tower
,
which
was
replaced
by
the
present
county
complex
in
the
early
0000s
.

By
the
end
of
the
0000s
,
the
downtown
business
district
was
again
showing
the
toll
of
massive
new
competition
from
the
latest
wave
of
suburban
shopping
centers
,
as
well
as
the
recession
that
hit
hardest
in
the
northeastern
states
.

In
response
,
the
Borough
Council
established
a
volunteer
group
of
civic-minded
representatives
from
business
organizations
,
government
,
and
the
residential
community
to
begin
to
formulate
plans
for
the
downtown
area
in
0000
.

This
effort
resulted
in
streetscape
improvements
composed
of
cast
iron
street
lamps
and
brick
pavers
,
facade
improvements
and
other
beautification
efforts
,
and
the
establishment
of
a
Main
Street
Manager
Program
.

As
the
0000s
progressed
,
the
downtown
rebuilt
itself
largely
by
turning
to
an
out-of-town
audience
.

Doylestown
had
long
been
respected
as
a
bucolic
tourist
destination
.

The
gentry
of
Philadelphia
and
New
York
maintained
country
estates
in
the
area
—
including
figures
of
the
Manhattan
theater
and
literary
scenes
—
often
summered
there
.

The
Mercer
Museum
,
Moravian
Pottery
and
Tile
Works
,
and
the
local
National
Shrine
of
Our
Lady
of
Czestochowa
brought
a
regular
stream
of
short
term
visitors
through
the
area
as
well
.

With
charitable
support
,
the
art
deco
County
Theater
was
restored
and
reopened
showing
arthouse
fare
,
and
a
new
main
library
and
art
museum
were
built
around
the
ruins
of
the
old
stone
jail
,
across
the
street
from
Mercer
's
castle
.

An
official
"
resort
town
"
designation
exempted
the
area
from
liquor
licence
caps
and
empty
commercial
space
began
to
fill
with
a
dense
and
vibrant
nighttime
scene
of
bars
and
restaurants
.

This
development
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
broader
development
of
the
region
;
as
the
Philadelphia
metropolitan
area
expanded
from
southern
into
central
Bucks
County
,
the
fields
and
farms
of
the
communities
around
Doylestown
quickly
began
to
sprout
housing
developments
.

This
development
brought
thousands
of
people
to
the
area
,
but
the
neighborhoods
created
often
lacked
longstanding
institutions
or
discernible
centers
.
